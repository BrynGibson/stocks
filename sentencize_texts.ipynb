Like, say you have 50 shares, either sell off all 50 and then listen to the news and buy back in and ride the wave if they announce a buy out. Or sell like 30-40 or whatever will get back your initial investment plus a nice profit and then leave the rest in to sit through the announcement. Your best bet to get all the profits you can is the first one unless news is good but you'll still make good profits in that case. The second one will lose you profits if its bad news but it won't sting that much since its extra profit and if the news is good those stocks were bought with a lower price point so its a higher profit margin and more than likely equivalent to what you'd be able to buy if the news announcement is good anyway. \n",

      "5. Back to the gearing, debt is important. How much debt do they have, does it look reasonable and their ability to pay it off.\n",
      "6. Commitments/contingencies/litigation. Do they have any large reserves for a possible or probable liability, if so, read the footnote.\n",

      "Profit and loss.\n",
      "1. Key here is growth. Growth or revenue year on year and growth of EBITDA year on year. Something that is very important too is the gross profit margin. As a company grows you'd like to think that they gain economies of scale. You want to see the gross profit margin stay consistent or increase. I don't like to see cost of sales increasing at a larger rate than revenue.\n",

      "Of course reading through the 10k is always the second step to DD. It normally starts with reading an article or forum of someone else Impressed with a company before id take my own look.

Yeah you're hurting investors in the short term but in doing so you're saving them from an even bigger crash later, if it's over valued it's overvalued, the sell off will happen regardless. To me this doesn't seem any different from selling, say a cup, you can tell the customer it's overpriced in your opinion but that you paid more than you feel it's worth as well and thus you can't charge less; it's not the best business sense as it pertains to the cup, but it may be for tue business as a whole as otherwise you risk upsetting customers if they later feel overcharged and don't come back to purchase your other products.\n",

Shareholders believe that if SECI wins just 1 Billion in damages that 1 share of SECI will be worth approximately $3,275 because only 306,000 shares exist due to 3 reverse stock splits.  SECI created Patented Disruptor Technology that was intended to provide all First Responders including Fire Departments with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications.

Now the CEO Pericles DeAvilla believes up 200 companies are illegally using Sector 10‚Äôs technology illegally.  Ironically there have been clues dropped that Microsoft might possibly be one of them since they purchased a Large Scale Data Analytics Tool from RedRover in 2008. RedRover is one of the companies Sector 10 is suing. All of the Due Diligence information can be found at InvestorsHub.com at the SECI message board.  Shares of SECI can be bought easily through TDAmeritrade or any other large broker.  Robinhood will not work for it.
