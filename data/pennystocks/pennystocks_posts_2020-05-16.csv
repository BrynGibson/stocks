7,My Noob? Strategy,gkunbw,TitanGodKing,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkunbw/my_noob_strategy/,1,52,"I'm Australian so this is on ASX pennystocks.
Basically, to buy into a stock you need to buy $500 minimum.

So my strat is to purchase 20 different penny stocks at $500 a piece for $10,000 and hope one hits big enough to make up for any losses. Hold for 5 years and hope for the best, particularly a good result from a mining/resources survey or clinical trial. As my choices as mostly resources.

https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx-listed-companies has a list of stocks by % increase and one for example that went from $0.003 to $0.405 right now
That's 10,000% so $500 investment turns into $67.5k


Let me know on a scale from Genius to Autistic what you think. I'll let you know. I Bought the stocks from Mid Jan to now and will see how we go. 

KTG would have turned 500 into just over 100k.

13,How is FRSX still this cheap??? Here's a little DD,gkq91f,Bullrun98,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkq91f/how_is_frsx_still_this_cheap_heres_a_little_dd/,1,30,"This stock is easily worth $1.50-$2.00, dominating the market share against MARK and others. It has had an absolute fire sale this whole week, as well! I feel really optimistic this upcoming week with this stock. They are working with big companies such as Rotax along with a few others, on the upcoming autonomous system as well as their thermal imaging work with FLIR. This might reach $2.00 in the foreseeable future, so consider this bargain leading into Monday. Long term (years holding, this could reach $5-10+, speculatively speaking). I am not just making up figures, as this company could is contributing with the future of autonomous works. Ford for instance, which has been an absolute disaster trying to produce their own line of autonomous vehicles compared to others. Implementing this system can reduce R&amp;D costs for companies, making it a more attractive contract for automative manufacturers to get involved with, especially since they are chipping out more money on operating expesnes and cannot fund as much for R&amp;D in the meantime. This will cause a reaction, luring other major manufacturers into this technology. Because at this point, very few competitors outside of Tesla, has been able to dominate the automative industry with its self driving cars. So why not lease the patent because it seems like a no-brainer with the level of debt these companies are in. There are a list of other companies that can benefit from implementing this technology into their cars and eventually it will become the norm of society, why? Because CONVENIENCE! People naturally like easier ways of managing their lifestyle and the tiniest changes make a difference to that level of conveniency. This is an absolute sleeper, and I cannot believe I have had the opportunity to hold an average of this stock at .82/share. By the time earnings release (which are expected to be VERY good based on their crazy progression during these harsh economic time), this is going to be back in the dollar land for good, period. And that does not even bring me to the partnership FLIR.... This is an extremely large company that they are now working with, which can only give them more exposure from the press, and from potential shareholders. They have an earnings report next week, which will be very interesting because they have a lot of potential revenue pouring in that is going to be factored into that analysis. This has a very similar set up to MARK, but with that said, it took MARK a bit to really start growing to where it got to its peak based on the thermal imaging aspect along with this company, so it may take a week or two before it gets closer to 1.50-2.00. But hey, many are considering buying into KTOV which price ceiling is what, $1? And it will take two weeks of paytience for the returns most people are aiming for. Bottom point: This is the next swing to get in on for next week. At 79C/share this is an absolute steal to consider adding to your portfolio Monday. I called KTOV for you all last week at a price that would have yielded you 30% gains, this stock can yield better gains and give you comfortability that you are getting in at an amazing price! This stock is one PR away from $1.50, just like KTOV.",2020-05-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkq91f/how_is_frsx_still_this_cheap_heres_a_little_dd/

Here’s why...

—

$CLIS seems to be following the same direction as HQ, and for those of you who don’t know, HQ trivia was an online trivia game launched in 2017 which had a huge following in a short period of time. Here’s some stats:




12.8 million HQ Trivia downloads as of August 2018

Peak concurrent HQ Trivia audience is 2.4 million

2.2 million tuned in for an HQ Trivia game hosted by The Rock, 1.7 million for special Nike edition

In January 2018 HQ Trivia topped trivia category in Apple App Store (third in games, and sixth overall)

Highest HQ Trivia prize pot to date is $400,000, coinciding with NBA finals

Biggest individual HQ Trivia winner claimed $50,000


—


But what were most interested in are the moneys, the numbers, the **BIG BUCKS**


**HQ Trivia valued at $100 million after $15 million Founders Fund investment in March 2018**

**$10 million in HQ Trivia ad sales over 2018**



 
With this whole coronavirus thing going on, and all of the deprived sports watchers sitting at home looking for anything to scratch that sports itch, so viewership will be HUGE, at least for the premiere.

—

Now that we’ve established the baseline and some numbers, here’s why you should get in now.

With something this big on the way, it’s only gonna get hyped more and more as June approaches. While you may be able to capitalize on intraday dips, I think that from here on, the 2 weeks leading up to June 1 will pump the price high because of the increased media attention this thing is gonna get. Even if you get in at .2, this thing is likely to hit upwards of dollars at its peak. Get in while you can.

**TLDR:** Get in ASAP, doesn’t really matter when, it’ll hit upwards of dollars, and profit is profit.

It took me making mistakes and trying to follow different peoples strategies from this subreddit to realize that I needed to pave my own path. 

The key was to use this subreddit to create my watchlist and to find a strategy that worked for me personally. 

A lot of people here chase a hyped up stock or buy because the comments say it’s a good time. I tried doing that, and rather I got to the party too late, or I bought and had to hold my funds on the same stock for multiple days at a time, which didn’t work with my impatience. Some people here have patience and they see larger profits from it, and this strategy does work for a lot of people! It’s just not my cup of tea. 

So instead I will find a hyped up stock from this subreddit that recently had a major drop, but I’d be careful and try to buy when the stock showed signs that it was getting ready to go back up, even if the increase was marginally less than the first run, then I’d sell when I felt this increase was at its peak, or when I hit my profit goal (whichever comes first). If I thought a stock was going to continue the decrease for longer than I’d like to hold based on the indicators Ive learned to read, I’d avoid it. A bunch of days with small profits is much better for me than risking for a HUGE profit, but it not paying off. 

Premarket dips are my favorite to go for, or dips right when the premarket opens and a bunch of people sell off.

While this strategy doesn’t necessarily work for everyone, and stocks are a probability game, I found that I’m much better at this “scalping” strategy than I am at simply just buying what this subreddit tells me to do. 

Anyway, if you get anything from this post, it’s that if you’re seeing a consistent loss of profit from this subreddit, CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY! It’s not a matter of you choosing the wrong stocks, but it’s that you’ve chosen the wrong strategy for you. Pick something that works for your patience level as well as your level of understanding. 

A very small percentage of people are profitable with penny stocks over the long term, so to be the small percentage that DOES profit, I think you need to stray away from the pack. Doing what most people do won’t get you consistent profits. 

Sorry for the long post, but I hope this resonates with someone. And if you find that you liked my strategy, please learn the indicators that you feel the most comfortable with before attempting it.

    What I'm trying to figure out is how do companies who make these sorts of games typically do? So far I found the big one called HQ Trivia from the guys who made Vine. It apparantly launched big but struggled to keep people coming back. Then one of the founders died and the investors weren't willing to continue funding it. Then the company failed to complete an aquisition deal and moved to dissolve.

    Are there any successful companies running this type of live gameshow mobile game? What makes this one different?

I know Sabby has a reputation of dumping stocks and making the share price fall and shorting it but there may be some opportunity for this thing to go back up and ride that wave and hop off before its done. 

Actinium Pharmaceuticals (ATNM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing cancer treatments. They have one treatment in phase 3 and a couple others in phase 1, phase 2 and preclinical. I don't see any catalyst for it moving any time soon but if there is some good PR from the company and/or FDA approval of one of their treatments this could have a decent run. It's most recent high was .24 back around April 21st 2020.

87,A friendly warning for those who are circulating around the tickers ATNM or SHIP - Sabby Management LLC is involved and might be corrupt.,gl0m4e,dicedtomatoes55,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gl0m4e/a_friendly_warning_for_those_who_are_circulating/,3,14,"First of all, you're probably asking who the hell is Sabby Management LLC and why should I be concerned? Well, I was the same way for a while (because I own both stocks) until I did my due diligence and some research. 

I'm not really good yet with advanced stock lingo so please bear me if what I'm about to say sounds confusing.

Using [fintel.io](https://fintel.io) (which is a really neat website to find out institutional owners of your stock and how they're trading - think Vanguard, Swab Charles, Morgan Stanley, etc.), I was looking up each and every one of the stocks that I own and for about 1/3 of all that I own, I found one of the common threads to be Sabby Management. Among the rest of the big players, the word Sabby isn't really instantly recognizable like the others I mentioned above.

**Sabby Management owns 7.29% of ATNM and 9.94% of SHIP.**

Sabby Management doesn't even have a trace of a website.

[An article that was published on March 25th, 2020](https://utopiacap.com/2020/03/25/sabby-management/) from UtopiaCap (I've personally never heard of them but the article seemed to be one of the first to pop up when I searched for Sabby Management on Google).

**To give you a quick summary, they say that 73 out of the 75 companies that Savvy Managment LLC invested in within the past two years or so have a 33.45% average annualized rate of return.**

**Sabby was also named as a defendant in a SEC administrative proceeding resulting in a cease and desist order.** 

*The following is taken from the article on UtopiaCap:* ""**This came as a result of Sabby Management violating  Rule 105 of Regulation M of the Exchange Act, a rule that “prohibits buying an equity security made available through a public offering, conducted on a firm commitment basis, from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in the offering after having sold short the same security during the restricted period as defined therein”.  The SEC stated that “On two occasions between December 2014 and February 2015, Sabby bought offering shares from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in a follow-on public offering after having sold short the same security during the Rule 105 restricted period.  The violations resulted inprofits of $184,747.10” (**[**2**](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/34-76141.pdf)**). Sabby Management settled the matter by agreeing to pay disgorgement of $184,747.10, prejudgment interest of $2,331.51, and a penalty of $91,669.95 (**[**3**](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-239.html)**). Our previous investor warning highlighted how** [**Hudson Bay Capital settled with the SEC for violating this very same rule**](https://utopiacap.com/2020/03/20/hudson-bay-capital-management/)**.""**

I feel proud of myself for digging and finding all of this out but this all turns into one big question - why isn't ATNM or SHIP doing anything about this?",2020-05-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gl0m4e/a_friendly_warning_for_those_who_are_circulating/

Lets take GNUS, they used to cost 250 a stock but now only 1.5, over the years all it has done is decline, why do people feel buying this can make a profit? 

Another thing, what has to happen for a pennystock to recieve 30+% raise in value?

People seem to be uneasy about this and I’m not sure why. I plan to hold and sell almost nearly before the meeting on Monday and secure my earnings (hopefully), but I seen people worried about the R/S? Correct me if I’m wrong, but my position would still be valued the same after a R/S right? Like if it’s 2:1 then I’ll just own half the shares at twice the price they’re worth now? Are they worried because any penny gains are worth less percentage to their overall gain? Personally I take whatever profit I can get, but should I do my best to sell before the R/S as well?
