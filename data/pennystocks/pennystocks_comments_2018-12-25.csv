Sure they’re inherently risky but there’s ways to play them for significant gains as long as you’re careful.

OP is young and has plenty of time to lose money and learn from his mistakes. If he’s going to rock penny stocks this is the time to start. 

OP: I recommend you make sure that you start by acquiring a good knowledge base and paper trading. Once you’ve learned the mechanics from paper trading you can start putting some smaller amounts of money towards some equities. paper trading is great for learning the basic mechanics of the market but until there’s real money on the line you won’t have to deal with the emotions. Don’t ever let them get the better of you, know what you hold and why you hold it.

I’d still put the majority of your money into long term investments, starting a retirement account at your age will increase the amount of money you have at retirement exponentially due to compounding interest. 

Other than that some basic advice I like to give is don’t get greedy, there’s nothing wrong with leaving money on the table as long as you walk away with a profit, I struggled with that one when I first started and lost a lot of money that I could’ve taken profits from. ",2018-12-25

I save up a bit and at age 19, I put my money on mutual fund but it was decreasing because they were charging me fee here and there. I didn't want to lose my money to another scammer. I decided to manage my own portfolio. The timing was good because people were pessimistic and tech like Alibaba, Netflix and FB was starting. I also did long term investment and day trading. My short-term portfolio made lost during euro crisis $25k. I wanted to sell my long term stock many time but I leaved it alone and diversify my income. I worked at marketing consultant and real estate but I hated it. I invest some money in food logistic import export but lost to some thiefs $40k. I learned to not trust nobody, your fam or friends too.
