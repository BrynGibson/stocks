For animals, Jaguar's lead prescription drug candidate is Canalevia. It is a canine-specific formula that will treat various forms of diarrhea in dogs.

Jaguar also has Equilevia in its pipeline, which will provide ""total gut health"" for equine athletes. Equilevia will help fight off ulcers, which are predominant in performance horses.

In 2005, 97% of performance horses in a study had either gastric or a colonic ulcer, according to¬†BusinessWire.com.

With all these revenue sources, Aegis Capital Corp. has a big prediction for the JAGX stock price‚Ä¶
