I bought at .95 and this run up has been absolutely ridiculous, I have yet to see anyone else who is holding it",2018-03-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83bf6s/thoughts_on_grxxfgre/
1,Mythical FDA approval dates,83h23o,ArmoredDragonIMO,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83h23o/mythical_fda_approval_dates/,0,11,"So I keep hearing about these FDA approval dates ""right around the corner"", and usually from the same three stocks (BPMX, AKER, and JAGX, all of which, probably not coincidentally, are robinhood penny stocks, and is making me start to think this subreddit is just an extension of r/robinhoodpennystocks because those seem to be mentioned the most here.)

Where on earth is this information coming from? The usual sources (here, investorhub, etc) have been saying this for months, even years, and yet I can't find even a single source that mentions anything like this that isn't just a speculation piece. So please, enlighten me, where is a reliable source that actually says it really is right around the corner, or better yet, ANY ACTUAL DATE AT ALL?

Also something that should be said: If the company itself stated ""approval date"" before such a date actually occurred, then I think the SEC would really frown on that, and so would the FDA.",2018-03-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83h23o/mythical_fda_approval_dates/
