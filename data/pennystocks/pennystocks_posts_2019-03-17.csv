1,Nanocaps keep producing great day trading opportunities $ATOS $AKTX $VVPR,b24ew0,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b24ew0/nanocaps_keep_producing_great_day_trading/,1,1,"These whole past weeks are incredible while there are so many day trading opportunities within micro and nano cap stock space. Especially nano caps are active. Many over 100% runners and it seems it just doesn't slow down.

&amp;#x200B;

As well for swing traders, we can see many microcap stocks that bottomed and enjoy longer-term price runs or spikes that still lasts and produce trading opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

This week's biggest runner not really compares to $BPTH but nevertheless made a big move. 

&amp;#x200B;

$ATOS after huge pre-market gap gained some more momentum just to lose it all the next day. I know some of you might be offended but do not expect much from this stock. The opportunity for buying it already passed. Now it is the time for sellers and short sellers. Yes, it is my time:)

&amp;#x200B;

$AKTX was classical nano cap runner. Opened with a normal gap in comparison to its price action. Released positive new, poured a lot of volume, traded its float and ran high. Next day gapped up and popped. As I said - classic! As well after such price action, you should not expect much if you are interested to buy it. Wait for a new runner. It will come!

&amp;#x200B;

$VVPR as well ran high. The major thing that probably slipped through many eyes was that stock broke 200MA on the day of the run. This is a big thing! The stock broke not only 200ma but as well many highs/resistances to finally be stopped at 3$ mark. From there we saw a nice price slump. As well there were shortable shares available for this stocks ($IBKR) and 200MA provided a great exit point. I like the stocks that are most of the time overlooked or not so ""hot"". Easier to short sell them.

&amp;#x200B;

Did you trade any of these stocks this week?

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, the price action story in this space is the same. Huge runs and big drops. Use this price action to your advantage to bank some bucks!",2019-03-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b24ew0/nanocaps_keep_producing_great_day_trading/
2,Penny Stock Trading Diary - Week 3,b20hne,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b20hne/penny_stock_trading_diary_week_3/,37,19,"### Week 3

Third week in the books! This week was pretty solid! I was able to close out 3 trades this week and one of the things I am most excited about is I am all cash going into next week! Not holding anything over the weekend and ready to jump into some new trades next week. My net profit this week was **$367.59**. Pretty comfortable with that profit amount this week, my account is actually up about $500 from last week because I was down a bit in BIOC at the end of last week and then came back and hit my price target so overall great week. Also broke through $11,000 which is exciting! Let's jump into the trades I made this week and their breakdowns.

These were the tickers I traded for the week of March 11th 2019:

* BIOC
* BW
* NGD

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the log above overall pretty solid week. If you read the first post before I started my goal was to exit each trade around 5% profit and keep a tight stop loss on the losers. This week is a good example of that where I took two wins at about 5% and then my 1 loser was only 2.5%. As long as I keep with this strategy my account will regularly increase week over week.

### Trade Highlights

**BIOC -** This trade took slightly longer than I originally anticipated but I knew this play would pay off once it got a little momentum. This is one that is hard not to look back on after exiting at $1.09 because later that day it went to $1.20+ and then $1.50+ in the coming days. That's why I try not to look back at trades after I cut them because then you hold out for bigger gains on the next one and get burned on it. Consistently taking 5% is somewhat easy to do in penny land and compounding those gains daily, weekly, monthly can add up super fast. Back to the breakdown on this trade, The support level was very strong and setup super well for a move to the upside. My risk was pretty low on this trade as I had entered right near support. I got a nice bounce and already had my sell in place at $1.09 which hit and I was out at 5%.

**BW -** I stumbled upon this setup on BW in the middle of the week and actually made a post about it on my Twitter Account**.** This stock had a pretty steep fall in the past several weeks and had ventured down to a $0.43 support level it had found in prior months. This level I felt was pretty safe for an entry. The day I entered the stock actually fell below my entry which was $0.44 and went to $0.43, which I should have been more patient and waited for that entry. At the time I was holding 12,000 shares so had I entered 1 cent lower that's an extra $120. Anyway, got a nice bounce on Friday and the stock was hovering at $0.46 and somewhat struggling there, not to mention the big 300,000 share ask at $0.46. So I went ahead and locked in my profits at $0.4597 via a market sell, I will probably keep my eye on this stock next week and try to re-enter again at $0.43 and see if we get another run to $0.46-$0.47 this upcoming week.

**NGD -** I honestly can't believe I took a loss on this trade, I could learn a lesson or two from the above BW trade this week. I have been holding NGD for pretty close to two weeks now and not at any point was down on this trade. I entered at $0.85 and was looking for $0.90 as my price target. This stock hit $0.89 at least 5-6 times before rejecting and coming back down. Should not have been so stubborn and just taken what the stock would give me. I could have exited this trade for roughly $200 profit just about every single day from the day I bought all the way up till the day I got stopped out which was Friday. To add to the frustration check out this extremely disappointing chart below, I had a stop loss if the stock broke $0.83, which it did on Friday and stopped me out. Then right after that this stock decides to make a 10% move and go all the way up to where my $0.90 limit sell would have been... comical. Below is the intraday 5min chart from Friday.

### Key Takeaways

Overall, another satisfactory week. That is 3 weeks in the books and 3 weeks worth of profits. A few of my goals from my original post were exit trades for 5% profit and keep my losses small. If you go back each of my first 3 weeks I took 1 loss each week and all three were very small. I have had 10 trades so far with 7 winners and 3 losers. All of the winners have been higher profit than any of the 3 losers. This is a great recipe for consistently making money. I am looking forward to next week, going to keep a fairly modest goal of having over $11,244. That will put me over $1,000 profit within the first month of me getting back into trading penny stocks. My slightly longer term goal is reaching $15,000 which will allow me to make a few more trades per week which hopefully will result in higher and quicker profits.

The only other takeaway I have is if I get up 3-4% on a trade I may start taking the profits quicker on those trades. There have been a bunch of trades where I have reached that in 1-2 days and then held out for that extra 1% and been stuck holding for a few more days for that to hit. Had I taken 3-4% I could have been able to use those funds again on another trade and potentially made another 3-4% instead of holding out for that extra 1% on the original trade. Also for example like NGD I could have taken a $200+ profit rather than a $130 loss. That's a $300 swing in my account had I done that. We will see how next week goes though.

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey for this week. Keep on following and commenting for future weeks. Looking forward to what everyone has to say this week!

This seems like a great idea. Almost all penny stocks are dumpster fire junk. You could easily make so much money since almost all of these companies fail. 

However I’ve tried short selling different Penny stocks and my orders never go through. There are never any shares available to be borrowed. From what I’ve seen it seems impossible to short penny stocks. 

Has anyone looked into this?

But if that sector is generally overvalued, it may offer few stocks that are attractively priced. An investor could create a list of all the stocks in that sector that would track various [valuation](https://www.transparenttraders.me/search/label/Free%20Stock%20Course?&amp;max-results=10) measures, including ratios such as trailing [price-to-earnings](https://www.transparenttraders.me/search/label/Free%20Stock%20Course?&amp;max-results=10), price-to-sales, price-to-book, among others. When a company on the list met a specified valuation criterion, such as a PE ratio less than 15, he or she would then know that this stock was a possible candidate for investment. Many investment-oriented websites allow visitors to create watch-lists online.
