## Access to UCONN's technology could create the potential for HPPI to expand its pipeline of clinical stage itraconazole-based cancer treatments

PR Newswire

TAMPA, Fla., July 19, 2018

TAMPA, Fla., July 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --Â HedgePath Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB: HPPI), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and plans to commercialize innovative therapeutics for patients with cancer, announced today that it has signed an exclusive option agreement with the University of Connecticut (UConn) related to patents and patent applications covering certain chemical analogues of the FDA-approved anti-fungal drug itraconazole. Â 

A patented formation of itraconazole licensed by HPPI is the active ingredient in HPPI's existing lead product candidate, and having access to UConn's technology could create the potential for HPPI to expand its developmental pipeline of clinical stage itraconazole-based treatments for certain cancers.

The option agreement, which goes into effect on August 1, 2018, is for an exclusive option period of six (6) months, which is extendible to twelve (12) months. Â The optioned field of use includes all therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic uses for cancerous and non-cancerous cell proliferation disorders in humans.Â  Â During the term of exclusivity, UConn will not offer third parties the opportunity to license the patent portfolio within this field of use.Â  

The itraconazole analogues, which are being developed by Dr. M. Kyle Hadden, Associate Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at UConn, have modifications to particular regions of the itraconazole scaffold. Â The patents and patent applications include compositions of matter claims covering the itraconazole analogues and method claims covering their use for the treatment of cancer.Â  Data from Dr. Hadden's laboratory suggest that certain of these analogues maintain potent Hedgehog Pathway inhibition while exhibiting improved pharmacokinetic parameters and reduced off-target side effects sometimes associated with itraconazole.Â  Of particular interest to HPPI are two U.S. patents issued to UConn in May and December of 2017 regarding itraconazole analogues and their methods of use. 

Nicholas J. Virca, HPPI's President and CEO, stated ""We are excited to enter into this option agreement with UConnand to collaborate with Dr. Hadden's lab to study the potential anti-cancer properties of these analogues on a pre-clinical basis.Â  This effort is intended to help us determine the potential for these analogues as new itraconazole-based drugs which inhibit the Hedgehog Pathway in human cells.Â  The formulations of these analogues may also reduce the concern regarding the associated use of many other drugs that are contraindicated for patients being dosed with itraconazole.Â  This effort by UConn is synergistic with HPPI's regulatory strategy to repurpose itraconazole as an anti-cancer therapy and has the potential to lead to the development of the next generation of itraconazole therapies for HPPI."" Â
