7,Question about buyouts,erkqy6,captainmavro,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/erkqy6/question_about_buyouts/,1,4,"Hey all,

I had a question regarding how a Stock Price is typically affected when there is a buyout or takeover bid.
Let's say a company has a Market Cap of 20 million and trades around 0.05, and 500,000,000 outstanding shares.

No let's say another company bids on the first company for 1 billion dollars. Would the SP typically rise to around $2 a share?

The formula I used was 1 billion divided by 500 million shares equals $2.

Is this a fair guesstimate?",2020-01-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/erkqy6/question_about_buyouts/
