Then, since u wanna learn the penny world, I recommend observing, but not partaking, in the world of investors hub and investors hangout, find out what they know and how they know, see who is usually right and usually wrong. See where they get their info from. Learn about research methods from there on. If you wanna actually invest and not just gamble, I guess research is the most important. Find all the resources you need and book mark them. And be careful. Also, don’t worry if the company itself is a scam because usually you can make money if you time it right. If 50%+ of people are claiming long on a certain stock it means it’s usually good for flipping in the short while because it will fluctuate a lot.

I’ve been waiting for this spring for 4 years since the last big pop and I think we’ll get another in a few weeks.. ",2018-03-22

 numbers will be super insane. I mean who wants to buy from the black market, the guy might have two or three different types of marijuana maybe a couple edibles. In the store it's like you're literally at a toy store with 100s of different options. ",2018-03-22
174,peacefulpete,dwecrk0,/r/pennystocks/comments/86eb76/lvvv_is_creeping_up/dwecrk0/,1,"People argue the scenario where someone grows their own weed to sell even where rec is legal but when you go into a dispensary for the first time it’s surreal. I live in NV, talked with folks from California and they say the lines are insane. Even despite the taxes I guarantee people are spending a shit ton on weed there. We’ll find out soon, I think Q1 ended this week? ",2018-03-22
175,Seattlestocker,dwed72p,/r/pennystocks/comments/86eb76/lvvv_is_creeping_up/dwed72p/,1,"Lol, I've grown before. I would sell a little bit to my friends and whatnot. But it's really not worth it, my power bill was insane. Nutrients, lights, everything was quite the startup. In Washington we're actually not allowed to grow any plants ourselves. In California can you grow? Legally? That might be a small problem. But most people don't have the resources or the time or the space to grow even 5 plants. Not sure about Q1 can't find any information. ",2018-03-22

I think Californians can actually, Nevadans can. I know someone who grew once in college... completely agree with everything you said lol. Don't think they'd have the patience to do it again. For Q1 - I've just been positioning at bottoms of charts. TGIFF , LVVV , RSII etc.
