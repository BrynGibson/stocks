4,JeremyMo88,dzth3nq,/r/pennystocks/comments/8n6rc9/what_got_you_into_penny_stocks/dzth3nq/,1,"There were a few factors that got me into looking at penny stocks.  

For one I only had a small amount of money to invest, and it was fun to play the stocks without dumping a lot of money in.  It was part of the ""living the dream"" of thinking I'd make it big on a stock. 

Another factor, I once worked at a start up company.  When the company was approved to sell product the share price skyrocketed.  Sadly, I was still in my first year and had no stocks.  If I did I could have made a lot of money.  So now I am looking at stocks that could potentially jump again in the future.  

I don't know much about the minimal capital, but would be interested in other's responses.  In the non-penny stock market, like Weed Stocks, people are always saying they have 10k burning a hole in their pocket to invest.  If I have $200 I consider myself wealthy for investing.  

I will say that I like to buy stocks in large multiples, such as 100, 250, 500, etc. if at at all possible as getting only a handful of stocks isn't going to show any real long term growth.  ",2018-05-30

I plan on waiting a year at least before selling anything, unless there is major jump or some of the stocks that have gone way red break even again.  Then I can consolidate. 

Honestly that is probably the best advise I could give, don't spread yourself too thin.  I went a bit crazy buying stocks here and there, when I really should have stuck with a few.

You see many pennystocks rising in the charts for no real reason and a search of the news doesn't reveal anything either. If there is no profit and  the stock drops for some reason I'd be worried.

But if the stock drops and it has solid profit, I sleep better. It's probably a tug of war with the bulls and the bears.

Also, because pennystocks have such low entry price, there is no need for leverage. I'd be thinking leverage is more for companies like Microsoft or Intel.

I should explain about the trend. I try and grab the trend upwards just as it's starting to break out. The weekly charts are better at showing solid unmistakable trends. I don't use indicators or pure technical analysis.

Also the chart has to look neat and orderly for me to then go further and examine the company.

So what I'm doing is scanning hundreds of pennystock charts. When I find a pretty or nice looking chart, I'll then examine the fundamentals of the company. I don't give a damn if it make perfume and recycles garbage. Just a good profitable company.",2018-05-30

I still invest in decent companies that I trust and believe in. Most of my current equity is tied to Docusign, not a penny stock by any means, but a reputable company that I believe in and really do believe will stay and only grow as we get more and more digital \(so this is a long term investment\). 

But penny stocks are a good option for me too as I'm just starting to get serious about investing, but don't really have a lot of capital to move around \(the majority being tied to Docusign, my one exception that I'll make in terms of pricey stocks to buy\). 

Some mistakes is to not pay attention to the overall trends. Some penny stocks are dirt cheap, but they're dirt cheap for a reason. If the trend has been in a general downward spiral, don't buy into it hoping to catch the upticks, it's not worth the risk. If the company has been doing better and better \(I usually look at weekly, monthly, 3 month, and year\), then consider when to get it.

Another mistake is holding onto certain things too long, or too short. Once again, this comes back to looking at the overall trends, if the company has had a long upward trend, but today it took a bit of a dip, hold onto it, fluctuations happen. BUT, if the company has been having a very volatile trend, and the overall trend seems to be going down, cut your losses early if you can. You might be able to make up the losses if you invest in something else rather than holding onto something that might not pay out until a very long time. You could also come back to the stock when the trend goes back upward and make so profit there \(supposing that you got out before it got too low\), but if you hold, you just wait a long time to break even, whereas you could have gotten back in and made some profit by getting back in. 

A bit of a long thing, but these are just some lessons I've learned in my short time with investing so far.  ",2018-05-30

On May 30, 2018, Bemax Inc.(“the Company”) received a notice of default from JSJ Investments, Inc (“JSJ” and the “Default Notice”), which alleged the occurrence of an event of default under the terms that certain Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) sold by the Company to JSJ on March 27, 2017 and August 3, 2017 respectively, and demand all principal and accrued interest outstanding under the Convertible Notes to be immediately due and payable.

 

The Company vehemently disagreed with JSJ’s claims and allegations and refused to comply with JSJ’s demands stated on the Default Notice. On May 21, 2018 pursuant to the amendment section on the Notes, the Company seeks to restructure the Notes which JSJ refused to accept with primary intention to continue to dump the shares of Company in to the market.
