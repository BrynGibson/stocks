The content is nothing more than a collaboration of visual examinations over the past years, from myself, and other traders. If I reverberate myself, I apologize in advance. Let me commence by sharing what initially prompted me to do so. After I read Mike Bellafiore’s book (runs SMB prop firm) I was PROFOUNDLY daunted and frightened to verbally express the least. Why you might ask? Well, I felt like I see first hand how much time, effort, and focus the best of the best put into trading. I cerebrated I was exerting myself strenuously? Hysterical. You can unequivocally tell these guys take it to the next level. They do everything so sedulously, from reviewing trades, visually examining tape, ameliorating on executions, and these are the guys I’m up against? It was an eye opening for me. The enormity of prosperity they’ve had is by no means a contingency.

**Trading is...**
-

Trading is hard. It’s very hard. You’re constantly competing against the sharpest, most perspicacious human beings/computers in the world, who have deeper pockets, more information, and more experience than you do.You have to battle with yourself, contravene the crowd, what’s so consciously innate to us, and battle the constant paradoxes that the market so often presents. There are many ways to make money in the market, but they’re hard to find. See? Paradox. You have to understand your opponents, have a proven game plan, and pick your battles wisely. Ready to play? Find a niche, dominate it, and become the house.

I’m personally not much of a writer, which is why I have chosen what I feel like is a simpler format below. I truly hope you enjoy, and find something that can help improve your trading.


**Most Common Mistake Traders Make**
-

They get into a comfort zone of always trading the same size regardless of the setup.

* Focusing on mediocre ideas. Mediocre ideas = mediocre results. All they do is take time and focus away from what’s truly needed to be successful.

* Having a fear of losses. The greatest mistake you can make in trading is to continually fear you will make one. Accept that you will make mistakes. Stop being so afraid of what could go wrong and be excited about what could go right.

* Overtrading. Your goal is to trade well, not often.

* Focusing on money. Your focus early on shouldn’t be how much money can I make. It should be how can I survive the next 40 years? It takes one trade to ruin it all. Think for a second how many stocks could’ve ruined your life from being stubborn in the past 24 months alone (TNDM, ECYT, I, HEAR, KBIO, ETRM, HTGM, OPNT, KONE, AWX, GBR, ABIL, etc). You say you respect risk, but most truly don’t, until it’s too late.


**Books...**
-

Let me start off by saying I’ve read a myriad of investing books. Naively, I was always hoping to get that “ah ha!” moment at some point while doing so. Don’t waste your time.It won’t happen. It will never be a moment. Rather, you should prepare for a long, strenuous process of making all the mistakes possible. Just be sure to assimilate them, and avoid repeating them in the future.

* Principles (Dalio)
* InsiderBuySuperstocks
* Momo Traders
* Market Wizards
* One Good Trade
---Many of my favorites on this list intertwine markets with a concentrated effort on psychology, and how to think more openly and independently.


**Quotes**
-

I’ve always been someone who has saved trading quotes over the years, as I’ve ingrained many of these in my head, and implemented many of their principles into my trading.

There’s only one side to a trade, and it’s not the bull or bear side, rather it’s the right side. As a trader, you have to decide what’s more important - being right or making money, because the two aren’t always synonymous with one another.

**Another thing...**
-

Every time you confront something painful in the market, or life, you are at a potentially important juncture--you have the opportunity to confront the painful truth head on, or you can choose to comfort yourself with delusion and misconception. If you really want to succeed at trading, you will find a way. If you don’t want to, you’ll find an excuse. It’s simple, you can make money, or you can make excuses, but you can’t make both.

* The greatest form of maturity is ownership. Own your mistakes and learn from them. Admit under performance. Understand why. And don’t repeat it in the future. It’s hard. Get over it. Adapt or die.

* If you can’t learn to take a small loss, sooner or later you’ll take the mother of all losses. It’s not wrong to be wrong, it wrong to STAY wrong! Don’t cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it. You can never make the same mistake twice. The second time, it’s a choice.

* You’re not “stuck or trapped” in a position. It’s just your ego stopping you from making the right decision.

* Great traders understand the difference between seeing a trade and looking for a trade. Remain patient, they will always come, and when they do, it’s obvious.

* Don’t be stubborn and fight the frontside of a move. Would you rather fight Mike Tyson in the 1st or 10th round?

* Learning trading means living a few years of your life like most won’t, so you can spend the rest of your life like most cant.

* Education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune. And if you think education is expensive, try ignorance. Everyone’s born ignorant, but one has to try hard to remain it.

* Stop focusing so much energy on debating people online. Debate them in the marketplace ;)",2020-03-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fqsm9l/ive_been_thinking_about_this_for_a_while/

I am a young fellow just about to end his junior year of college. I've been playing around with the idea of penny stock trading for some time now and I have a very limited understanding of the basics. 

Are there any suggested courses you folks recommend for me to understand the basics so I could get started somewhere? I've heard of Tim Sykes and Grittani and the chart guys and it seems that people have very mixed opinions about all of them, so I am unsure of where I should start.

While I am more focused and oriented on charts/catalysts, someone saw something that I too saw it as well. I could have arguably made a post about this but I didn't want to lead to speculation of FOMO or a potential pump/dump crew, and this isn't my style. Just for fun, when I noticed an odd activity breaking above nearly 0.09 twice, I added 1000 shares, and boy did it break higher highs than normal. Not to mention... hard gap ups &amp; pull backs occasionally. 

For those expecting an answer... the real reason is I am good at catching this often are two reasons: outside bar &amp; a dead float. This is a unique phenomenon, thus someone decided to test a trend and the downtrend turned into a breakout.

26,CODX Options Tutorial?,fqd62u,LAMOTTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fqd62u/codx_options_tutorial/,1,2,"Hey all, I'm just getting started looking into options and have a question around a basic scenario.

We've all seen a lot of pump and dump price action over the last few weeks/months. Let's take an example where a stock has been pumped extremely high and I feel that it's overvalued and about to come falling back down (flashbacks of CODX \~$17.81)

Let's say on day D that I see it crashing hard from $17.81, and at $17, I decided to **buy a $16 put** 2 days out at D+2.

1. Hypothetically if the price hit **$16.01** and then went back up and never hit $16 during the 2 days, my option would **not** have been exercised, right? Like, it has to hit the strike price and there's no way to exercise before that?
2. If the $16 put is quoted at $3 per share, then it would cost me $300 + some premium to enter this trade, correct? And that's the maximum I can lose?
3. In terms of profit **if the price** **hits $16,** then what- do I only make 100 shares \*($17-$16) = $100 profit?  

   1. Or is the idea that I now own 100 shares of CODX at $16 when I only paid $300 + premium, so I can sell for Profit = 100\*$16 - $300 = $1300?

Thanks for reading this if you're still here... If you have any helpful options resources I'd be happy to take them but please try to answer the questions in addition to just slapping me with a link :) Thanks in advance!",2020-03-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fqd62u/codx_options_tutorial/
