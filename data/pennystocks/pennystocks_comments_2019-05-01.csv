Let me start by saying you're going to have to study your butt off to learn how these penny stocks work out. Their patterns become so predictable after seeing it time and time again, which means that making money off of them is actually very easy after putting in the work to learn. 

Now teaching you everything I know in this post after 4 years experience trading in the market is pretty impossible. However if you want to learn more, I won't sell you anything but I do have a youtube channel teaching my high success rate strategy on day trading penny stocks. Every trade I do on my account will be uploaded to the channel to maintain transparency and validity to my viewers. 

If you're interested in seeing a seasoned market goer in action the link to my channel is here: [penny stock youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeYJRy__ovsx_ygBUUsek1w)",2019-05-01
