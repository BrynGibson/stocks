I read about the business and the technology they are demonstrating in Canada and see a lot of applications for it in the future. Hoping this stock turns around and only goes up with new customers. 

Wish me luck. ",2018-06-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8tqsc3/inpx/
4,IBAT on CNSX,8tqkt9,SofaKingNatty,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8tqkt9/ibat_on_cnsx/,4,0,"I noticed a lot of you on here like lithium related business.

Was curious about your thoughts on IBAT?

The price has been going into a slide and it seems like an enticing buy.

I have owned in the past and done well on the volatility, news releases, and stock promotions, and have a bit left at an average of $0.356.

Just wanted to see what others on here feel about the position. Reading through their SEDAR you can get a good idea for the fluctuations in price. ",2018-06-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8tqkt9/ibat_on_cnsx/

6,My watchlist for tomorrow,8tnapx,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8tnapx/my_watchlist_for_tomorrow/,41,4,"RENN - The way my screener picked this stock is not accurate. The stock was at $10/share the other day and then dropped to $1.85/share in a single day resulting in an 80&amp;#37;+ crash! The stock shows a 155&amp;#37; gain but that's because it opened at 1.85 and rose to 2.36. I would avoid this stock considering how much it fell. HOWEVER, there's some talk the stock could rebound and head higher. I would say if the stock passes $3/share it might be a good buying opportunity, but $3 should be the price target.  


WSCWW - Based on the historical price action on this stock, the price spikes, then gradually declines, then spikes again. Following this trend this stock will most likely decline over time. I would personally stay away.  


ZOM - This stock reached a high on Friday, but started to weaken during the close. If the price can sustain a level above $3 I would consider buying momentarily during the morning, but sell later in the trading session.  


AMPE - Price fell under my divisible by 5 rule. As the stock close during the session price action began to reach previous resistance at $2.16. If price can rise above $2.15 tomorrow it might be a quick buy, but I wouldn't count on it continuing to climb higher and higher. Not substantiated by much   


TRXC - I traded this stock 2 years ago and made several thousand dollars (on multiple occasions). This was back before it even reached $1. I had this stock in my personal watchlist for a while and then gave up on it because I was focusing on other stocks. If I would have kept much money in there from a couple years ago I would have ended up with a $60,000+ profit! I would raise caution with this one because price has been steadily increasing since May, So there is a lot of buying/demand, but when that demand falls, remember what happens in my penny stock videos due to the laws of supply and demand!
