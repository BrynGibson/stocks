I found that PTIE was previously trading at ~$10. The price significantly dropped after one of their only two pipeline products (REMOXY) was denied FDA approval. The price dropped to ~0.80. This leaves PTIE with only one product (PTI-125), a small oral molecule drug candidate just about to finish stage 1 clinical trial. PTIE now has allocated all focus on PTI-125.

On August 15th, PTI received 3.2 million in a clinical research grant from the national institute of health. This resulted in a price increase to ~$1.97 and back down to ~$1.04.

Being that this company only has one item in their pipeline that is only on stage 1 clinical, why would we see this stock rise in price in the coming weeks/months?",2018-09-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9cgg7f/ptie/
