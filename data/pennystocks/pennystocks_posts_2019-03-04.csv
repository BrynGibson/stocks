(OTC:IMTL) (imageprotect.com) (‚ÄúImage Protect‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a global leader in the end-to-end copyright Infringement sector, is proud to announce that it has begun to on-board world famous celebrity photographer, Idris Erba (idriserba.com) as a partner and client. Mr. Erba‚Äôs exclusive A-list celebrity clientele portfolio includes Jamie Foxx, Floyd Mayweather, and Cristiano Ronaldo, among others.

Management notes that idriserba.com generates millions of hits annually due to the high-profile subjects depicted and the renowned quality of Mr. Erba‚Äôs visual art. The IPShare technology is designed and built to monetize this type of traffic by way of In-Image advertising, a rapidly growing Ad tech market that is estimated at over $50 billion in total size.

Image Protect CEO, Lawrence Adams stated, ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited to have such a talent and a website like this on-boarded and loaded with the IPShare App. This partnership is a win-win for both parties and we hope to execute many more partnerships like this over the near term. This new revenue model supplants all the legacy Infringement revenue by tenfold per our 2019 projections.‚Äù

In-image advertising relies heavily on image recognition ‚Äî a market that could be worth nearly $39 billion by 2021. Image recognition refers to the real-time analysis of viewed, saved, and shared images across all platforms, apps, and mobile devices. With about three billion images uploaded per day, image recognition advertising opens up massive possibilities for marketers, including in-image advertising models.

The Company believes that the IPShare model has a number of advantages for both digital image rightsholders and potential advertisers. As images are passed through the internet, Image Protect can generate revenue by tracking their utilization and deploying strategic in-image ads.

Mr. Adams continued, ‚ÄúBoth traditional advertising and traditional copyright protection have taken a back seat to a newer integrated methodology with superior interactivity and monetization potential. With millions of images now under management, Image Protect is extremely well positioned to maximize shareholder value as we benefit from the rapid growth potential of the in-image ad model.‚Äù

About IPShare

Image Protect finds millions of editorial websites using their client‚Äôs photos. As an option to the standard DMCA takedown notice, IPShare‚Ñ¢ generates a block of code that allows photos to be copied and pasted into any website ‚Äì similar to code references on sites that embed Youtube or Vimeo content. It‚Äôs as simple as copying and pasting the embed code into the user‚Äôs website template, i.e., WordPress, Blogger, SquareSpace, Wix, etc. The image is then instantly transformed into an online billboard, containing in-image advertising, hot links, social sharing and dynamic messaging. This transforms the traditional Copyright Infringement model into a cooperative relationship for both creators and publishers.

About Image Protect

Image Protect protects and monetizes creative works. By uniting technology with a team of copyright experts, we ensure that content providers preserve the value of their digital assets. Our web application monitors the global Internet to seek and collect evidence for illegally used visual content. Then our legal partners across North America, Europe, and Asia ensure our clients receive appropriate compensation for work used without valid license.

This is a legit company with real products. SHMP was extremely good to me and I‚Äôve bought 380,000 shares of KGKG last week. I actually found out about SHMP months ago on the KGKG yahoo message board.

KGKG has been signing distribution deals left and right. Also an Amazon best seller. They are about to release earnings in a month and so and I expect crazy good results. 

A new bottling company posted a Facebook picture with KGKG last week. This one is actually is in Oregon. So far, KGKG has been building their bottling partners in the southeast. I expect a PR announcement soon. This company is building itself to be a national energy hemp brand or positioning itself for a buyout. 

Overall if you have the patience, you will be rewarded. I can see this stock at .30ish by end of year and 1.00 by 2020. Do your own DD and come to your own conclusion.

FYI, there is also a Facebook Kona Gold Shareholder group. I suggest joining. I‚Äôve learned a lot and can see the company growth in real time.

CEO, Salvador Rosillo, joined Stock Day host Everett Jolly.  


To begin the interview Jolly asked Rosillo for an update on the Company‚Äôs projects since he was last on the show in October. Rosillo shared that the Company has been developing its CBD oil extraction method that aids in the development of products for anxiety, pain, and other ailments without the effects of THC. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a medicine, it‚Äôs more like a regulator.‚Äù, stated Rosillo.

Rosillo explained that the Company wanted to get into the production side of the industry, however received defective machinery. They currently have technicians working on the distillery machines, which has slowed the Company‚Äôs progress. However, now the Company is getting back on track towards its goals.

Jolly then asked if the Company has begun processing yet and what the business plan is going forward. Rosillo explained that to really become competitors in the CBD space, they need to be able to process at least 1,200 kilos per day. This is a much larger capacity than the Company is currently able to handle, however they are making strides toward this goal.

Jolly followed by asking what steps the Company will take towards this goal. Rosillo shared that the Company is on the horizon of applying for additional capital to expand, which will allow them to achieve this growth.¬†

In closing, Rosillo shared that the Company is recuperating from previous hardships and is making preparations to expand and become a larger player in the CBD market.
