0,Retail vs MM increments trading?,7yin09,Suishou,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7yin09/retail_vs_mm_increments_trading/,2,2,"I noticed that retail traders can buy in increments of .0001, .0002, .0003, etc., but that market makers (and brokers?) can purchase, or sell, shares in penny stocks in increments that are significantly more refined. They can purchase, or sell, shares at .00014, .00016, etc. Can anyone point me to an article about this? Or tell me what this is called, so I can look it up. Thank you.

Why is there such a discrepancy? This seems very rigged...anyone care to explain?",2018-02-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7yin09/retail_vs_mm_increments_trading/
1,Questions on Day Trading.,7ykv9t,NOTtheSCMC,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ykv9t/questions_on_day_trading/,4,17,"I have a scottrade (soon to be TD Ameritrade) account. I know that if I transfer funds from my bank account it takes 3 business days for the funds to become settled and available for trading on the OTC. Of course if I drop a check off at the local branch they are available the same day.

When I buy stocks on the OTC do I have to wait 3 days for the funds to be transferred to the pennystock company before I sell them? Or do share purchases/sales happen instantly, where I can then turn around and sell them after 2 or 3 ticks, and then wait 3 days for the funds to settle into my account before I can use my profit to trade again?

If it takes 3 days to pay for the shares I purchased, how is day trading even possible? If this is the case please detail an example of how a day trade might go if I have $1K and I'm buying a stock at $0.0001.

Also do I NEED to have $25000 in my brokerage account to engage in this kind of day trading? I've only got $1000 there in cash, and a few more $K in stock in various companies. Am I going to get stock-blocked if I try to buy and sell in the same day?",2018-02-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ykv9t/questions_on_day_trading/

5,Bottom Play (ASKH),7ypap7,defectivetrekkie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ypap7/bottom_play_askh/,2,1,"Hello pennystock reddit goers, I used to visit this forum a lot but I haven't been here for awhile. Thought I'd start throwing out some stocks I feel are at their bottoms. ASKH is currently trading at 0.036. In their last 8k they released on 02/08/2018 they talked about their aquisition of ""Ziyang Holiday Bedroom Articles Co"". a company that made over 20 million dollars in revenue in 2017. Once this aquisition goes through this stock can easily make it to 30 cents+... and honestly I feel it could do more than that.

Here is the link to the 8k.
