You kids have fun pumping and dumping these penny stocks while it lasts because it won't. 

With this Coronavirus spreading and killing more and more people, this company is going to eventually take off, why? Because everyone is going to want to get tested, supply and demand. 

Watch the news and you'll see the lines of people waiting to be tested and yet a lot of them are being turned away, why? Because the US government doesn't have enough test kits to test everyone. 

Test kits are going to be shipping out to the US and Europe from this company in May.

The level 2 prints who is currently buying and selling.

It also prints orders, both big, small, and fake.

The time and sales shows the real-time flow of orders, who's buying and selling.

Level 2 shows who's looking to buy / sell, rather than who's actually doing it. The more complicated way of saying it is the orders on the time and sales take liquidity, filling the quickest order, while the orders on the level 2 add liquidity. I generally add liquidity to get cheaper commissions, and a better price.

When you add liquidity, you get a long position on the bid. In other words, you want someone to sell their order so you can buy it. There's a way to digest the information to get a read on where the price is going. This is known as tape reading. 

Tape reading needs to be combined with an influence. Whoever influences the price will give you a good read on whether the prices jump is going to fail, or continue. This takes time to learn, and is easy to fail at.",2020-03-19

I wake up at 7:30 to 8:00. See what's up. Get locates if needed. Get a general game plan internally. Already have objective rules on sizing into trades.

9:00 - 9:30 flush all fluids. Coffee if necessary.  Start screen-recording software. Already have watched stocks on screen.

9:30 - 9:45 look to scalp a quick rush of buying volume on volatile stocks. I short them because these buyers will flip to sellers on any sign of weakness. 

Press hotkeys to short. Add in trades. Never all-in a position. If I wanted a 10,000 share trade, I'd split the first entry as 2500 or the amount given the range / likely-hood it fails. This comes from experience.

9:45 - 10:30 halt levels change. Size less unless it's great setup.

Waitr was all the rage when it started expanding in Louisiana. I order a lot of delivery and they immediately became my only service because their app is far superior to any others I’ve used. They sent out professional photographers to photograph every dish. They gave the restaurants a sweet heart deal and even the fancier restaurants who normally wouldn’t consider a delivery option started jumping on board. At one pint they had every locally owned restaurant where I live. They operate by taking a percentage of the sale and handle all the taxes, etc instead of up charging the consumer as some delivery services. They expanded quickly and then acquired bite squad and expanded more. 

The problem was that sweet heart deal of a was apparently just a thing to get people to come aboard and last summer they changed the terms. The put the restaurants on a scale and the more you sold the lower the percentage they took from the sale. The top tier was a high dollar and more than most local restaurants would every sell in a given month. Which meant small local restaurants were paying 35% of each sale. They also told the restaurants they could no longer use the pictures that the restaurants had paid for initially. 

This pissed off local restaurants which pissed off the  customers. They claimed that 90% or so of the restaurants stayed on but that was not true for where I live. Lafayette (where it was started) led a campaign for everyone to stop using Waitr. Shortly after their problems really began which included not having a CEO for while. 

I bought in tuesday before it jumped because on Monday they closed all restaurants in Louisiana and made them to go only and the local guys who led the fuck Waitr movement were suddenly jumping back aboard. 

Long term there is no telling. I don’t know what percentage they are getting right now, I also don’t know how many people are really eating out and how many are going to continue as things get worse. They do operate in other states that have not closed restaurants yet. I think short term they will continue going up for a while, will they ever reach their original high, not sure. They definitely have promise if they manage things better this time around because they do have the superior app and for me personally if I’m not using them I just go get the food. It’s that much better.",2020-03-19

654,Best_Instruction,fl16f1c,/r/pennystocks/comments/flir22/7_year_daytrader_ama/fl16f1c/,1,"&gt;My budget is not much, about 3k.. so is it realistic to think that I could gain 'at least' $50 a day?

Starting out with 3k is low. If you start out with a larger amount, you can split the capital between several brokers to get around PDT rule. 

You won't make $50 a day starting out. You'd be lucky to be profitable. While I say that, if I was using 3k I'd double it extremely quickly. I've been in this for 7 years, so comparing isn't fair. $50 a day on $3k is low, a person could make $400 a day or more. Keep in mind that if I was given 3k to trade with, I'd already be alright with losing it. Don't put yourself in a position where you need it. Otherwise, this will be a nightmare experience. 

Look to be profitable first. Even if that means making $5 a day. That will help you tremendously long-term, as you'll grow on a small amount past the ""blow up"" stages. Survival is vital. 99.99% of people on here will not trade within 5 years, so if you want to be the one that does, trade super small size starting out.

&gt;A lot of people would recommend to trade forex or even options if my budget is not too much but I think those are very risky. 

Those people would be gamblers who like forex / options because it seems less risky. In other words, it seems like their odds are higher. This is known as the gamblers fallacy. Don't waste your time with options or forex, stick to equities.",2020-03-19
