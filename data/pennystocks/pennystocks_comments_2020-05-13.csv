[https://www.reddit.com/r/eMaginCorp/comments/7os6ym/emagin\_amd\_chronology/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eMaginCorp/comments/7os6ym/emagin_amd_chronology/)

**eMagin &amp; Google**

Jerry Carollo who Invented eMagin's [2K x 2K per eye prototype](https://www.roadtovr.com/emagin-announces-2kx2k-resolution-vr-headset-demoing-at-awe-2015/) is now Optical Architect at Google - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-carollo-310b4330/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-carollo-310b4330/)

**eMagin's Direct Patterning Technology**

eMagin's Direct Patterning technology is the only capable of allowing for high brightness OLED - +5,000 nits. This technology also has application beyond OLED microdisplays .

[https://www.reddit.com/r/eMaginCorp/comments/ggh9nr/emagin\_direct\_patterning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eMaginCorp/comments/ggh9nr/emagin_direct_patterning/)

**Conclusion**

The 2k x 2K per eye prototype Invented by Jerry Carollo and touted by Roy Taylor from AMD was too small to meet the needs of Next Generation VR.

eMagin is currently developing a 4K x 4K OLED Direct Patterned display (to be used per eye). This display should be revealed ""soon"".

And each trade I‚Äôve done I haven‚Äôt gone on necessary with a set amount spending wise in mind.  I usually look at the amount of shares.  Shares is the difference maker because the more you buy the more you make.  

You buy 10 shares of a stock (price being irrelevant) it goes up 0.01.  You made 0.10.  If you bought 3000 shares you made 30.0.  So I mainly look at the share count.  But my average buy in is $145.0.  But looking at it a lot of my purchases are in the $300-$500 range.  

Currently I‚Äôve been selling based off if I feel like I‚Äôve made enough.  But I do plan on later in the future of selling a certain # of shares based off a certain % increase.  I made a table and posted it if you‚Äôd like to see that.

Actually good info? Buried and only shows up once a day yet salm and that website is the problem, not this cancerous subreddit that bothers people because the market is down. 

By the way his stock predictions are doing alright, even the one that got him harassed is moving back up and another is in the green yet no one on hear today has offered any real evidence or proof meanwhile his choices are speaking for themselves.

Yeah I‚Äôm not going to listen to you when you are on this subreddit and you have the nerve to warn me about salm or any other person making predictions as a bad thing, aka what everyone does on here but way worse and with no receipts to show they know what they are talking about while those people actually do show stocks that work. It‚Äôs the blind leading the blind here and criticizing people when you yourself don‚Äôt know anymore than I do.

Maybe there's a blip here or there, but like quicksand, you're slowly sinking. Occasionally someone might throw a breadcrumb about the merger. Then posts come out about the 10-K. ""We're waiting for the finalized reports/10-K/financials, yadda yadda. There will be posts like, ""We're still finalizing the financials!""

I went through it and it‚Äôs not really evidence to prove anything right now, they never tell us how the stock ended up that he was claiming was going to do well and it doesn‚Äôt really explain how he survived this long if he was making it up the whole time, like if he was hiding all his bad posts followers would have noticed it awhile ago. 


What‚Äôs more likely to me is that you guys are just sick of people calling him a prophet (which yes is stupid and that‚Äôs fine to hate his fans but thats a moderator problem we can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs him doing it) and treating him like everyone should listen to him which no he shouldn‚Äôt but he was on a hot streak wasn‚Äôt he? Even posts he said like 3 weeks or months ago are shown to have gone up so it‚Äôs not all bullshit but it‚Äôs not like everyone‚Äôs right all the time. I just don‚Äôt get why he would still be able to do this if this has been out since January, not to mention he doesn‚Äôt charge people and it‚Äôs okay to not tell your secrets, he doesn‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation. 

I just don‚Äôt see how that makes him a scammer, sure he sounds kind of over the top hyping up the stock but even with that he doesn‚Äôt word his posts like that now and keeps it all really simple and says so and so will go up a certain amount, no fancy bullshit, no to the moon (except today when he acted weird but actually the post sort of explains why he acted weird) claims just what it will be and it‚Äôs on us to take it or leave it, a scammer would be someone charging you for advice and claiming you were going to get them rich, and yeah it will pump up when someone with a hot streak is claiming stocks are going up, he doesn‚Äôt even do it for day trades either so it‚Äôs even more unlikely that he really is just trying to pump and sell during the day.

Really though we‚Äôll find out if he‚Äôs a fraud soon enough when his stock choices either rise or fall, xela especially but he named a lot more than xela and some of them have gone up like IZEA and FET (one that had a huge dip and he said to be patient yet if you are a scammer and don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing why would he bother saying that?) so let‚Äôs just agree to disagree until then, my biggest argument is that we should have given the guy a fair shake, if he turns out to be a scammer I have no issues with what you all did but if he‚Äôs not that will really suck to do that to someone especially since he‚Äôs so thin skinned saying he was going to leave, a huge overreaction but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to leave hateful messages on his posts when no one knows if it‚Äôs true or not.",2020-05-13

This isn‚Äôt some dumb internet celebrity this is just a guy trying to sell stocks and help people that you know nothing about and doesn‚Äôt owe you to deal with your bullshit, I highly doubt you‚Äôd be able to be called a scammer on a really bad day by everyone after you tried to help them.

Yes he was overly sensitive but that still doesn‚Äôt make it right and it‚Äôs still shitty, no one has to put up with other people‚Äôs bullshit if they don‚Äôt want to, especially if you are doing it for free.

The worst part is you are just doing this shit for fun, well obviously it wasn‚Äôt fun for him cause he quit, hopefully he learns to ignore idiots like you who think just because you ‚Äúthink‚Äù you can handle something doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else should and it definitely means no one has to hear you laugh or insult them or calling them a scammer with no basis whatsoever. 

What‚Äôs funny is that his stocks are actually doing well, xela the one he was harassed for is normalized and even went up a little, that‚Äôs not the only one, IZEA picked up a lot and a bunch of other ones did as well, so if he ends up being right it‚Äôs going to make you look really stupid.",2020-05-13

Let's see what Mr.SEC has to say about pumping and dumping in the 21st century:

&gt;‚ÄúPump-and-dump‚Äù schemes involve the touting of a company‚Äôs stock (typically small, so-called ‚Äúmicrocap‚Äù companies) through false and misleading statements to the marketplace. These false claims could be made on social media such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as on bulletin boards and chat rooms. Pump-and-dump schemes often occur on the Internet where it is common to see messages posted that urge readers to buy a stock quickly or to sell before the price goes down, or a telemarketer will call using the same sort of pitch. Often the promoters will claim to have ‚Äúinside‚Äù information about an impending development or to use an ‚Äúinfallible‚Äù combination of economic and stock market data to pick stocks. In reality, they may be company insiders or paid promoters who stand to gain by selling their shares after the stock price is ‚Äúpumped‚Äù up by the buying frenzy they create.

They can see everything as part of their job, and are almost completely protected from insider trading charges.

When they buy in large quantities, they historically are extremely accurate at buying near the bottom (they have the knowledge and dont want to lose money). They also almost always buy around 6-12 months before a massive stock job. This is because it has to he out of that 180 range to remove any risk of persecution but not so far out that they are lowering their exposure to benefit by tying up funds they could have used for gains elsewhere.

I believe that the author is trying, however inelegantly, to point out that we are now in the fertile time frame. The date of the post, and the accompanying news, is highly indicative of both a massive boon, traditionally 5x at the least (Noone risks insider trade charges for less), and for this to come in a fairly quick time.

TLDR; the recent releases and us moving outside of 180 days from the CEO's purchase are strong indicators that the stock will increase it's value by at least 5 times over before October by using historically accurate measures that aren't really affected by charts.

Uavs was hilarious and I didn‚Äôt know how to use a limit order, made 1.2 k and was hovering 2.5k for soooo long.

MVIS made 600 instead of it hovering at 1500 for seriously a whole day.

And more recently mark I was staring at it at 2.4 all morning üòÇ, and then decided to take 1.9 for 900 shares. It‚Äôs even on the rise right now and I‚Äôm kinda kicking myself but I made money!

In the case of mark if I got in at 1.04 is it safe to assume it won‚Äôt reach that and I should have held considering all the information they are releasing looks pretty legit? 800ish profit

And then I tried an option yesterday with VTIQ 5 $25 5/15 and it hit 4.0 per and then I sold for 2.8 per. It hit 4.0 3 times and I got REALLY greedy and last 5 minutes EOD I got scared and then it skyrocket up to 3.5 before EOD. 930 profit. 

In the options case is it better to hold onto it until the 14th? Cause VTIQ is bullish or better to hit strike price then sell?

Research and development expenditures totaled $7.2 million down from $7.5 million in the prior year while selling, general and administrative spend was $11.9 million for the year, up 74%. Also Net loss benefited from a non-cash gain related to warrant valuation adding $1.1 million to the bottom line.

The two factors that are working in it's favor are commercialization of Probuphine and moving to online sales. Also it's not that common for a pharma to get a 5 yr contract for a popular/in-demand medication and be the only supplier as of now

I'm going to sell 100 or so over the next few days, maybe, then see how the next few weeks play out.

Ritter has very little money and no revenue, whereas Qualigen had $500,000 in revenue last year via diagnostics and has two Phase 2 trials in the works.

Get in on $STOCK with a decent position at 0.50 when momentum is bullish, stop loss @0.47, sell at 0.55.

**From what I see,** reading the proverbial ""tea leaves"", CEO Sharma may leverage \[the liquidity provided by 50 million shares\] to speed-up the M&amp;A process. And at the same time take 10 million shares to raise $30 million or so; and persuade us (the investor community) to NOT sell the LiDAR product vertical... and fund the R&amp;D for the next two years to keep developing this high profile, high value, high margin LiDAR product vertical that serves the Trillion Dollar TaaS \[Transportation as a Service\] business revolution.

**Personally,** I highly recommend CEO Sharma did that; and hope we (the investor community) supports the MicroVision management in their ""LiDAR as a product"" business model in the revolutionary TaaS marketplace.

**TaaS is over a Trillion Dollar automotive marketplace...** and it will be hugely profitable selling \[high value, high margin\] LiDAR for collision avoidance in new \[75 million cars per year\] and existing \[1.4 billion cars on the road\] and millions of Electric Autonomous Vehicles for the TaaS business marketplace revolution.

**Sales of MicroVision LiDAR will be huge and stupendously profitable**... based on its superb size, weight, power, functionality, day-light resolution and unmatched spec that is unique to LBS based 3-D scanning.

**What is TaaS:**

TaaS... Transportation as a Service is the latest technology revolution that will dramatically change the way we live, work and travel... it will forever change our lives..

I have been at the cusp of every single technological and business revolution over the past 50 years... but TaaS is the biggest with massive global impact that will change every aspect of 7 billion our lives on planet Earth.

**For me, it all started with:**

1. Nuclear Power in the late 60s... retired as Chief Engineer EI&amp;C in 1980.
2. Personal Computers in the late 70s... built a $60 million revenue computer company by 1995.
3. Internet in the late 80s... made over 1,000% profit with companies like Intel.
4. World Wide Web and Mobile in late 90s... missed the early days.
5. Online and Micro Payment networks in year 2000... launched [www.LeRumba.com](http://www.lerumba.com/)
6. Social Media in the 2000... missed the early days.
7. TaaS in the year 2019. Invested heavily, and continue to do so, in MicroVision stock (NASDAQ: MVIS)... all the way from $6 a few years ago... to $0.20 few months ago... and now to the present day.

Imagine a world with no service stations and no parking lots. Where houses or apartment blocks won‚Äôt require garages or parking bays. Where there are no speeding tickets or parking infringements, and the promise of no road fatalities. Where private commuters travel long distances to work while catching up on the latest news, work or catch-up on some extra sleep while traveling.

The advent of fully autonomous personal transport will likely be the most significant technological advance of the 21st century. Electric Vehicles and Driver-less vehicles will change the way everyone across the world lives, works and travels.

How autonomous transport systems will function will stretch the human imagination. ‚ÄúThe day fully autonomous vehicles hit our streets is the day cars are not cars anymore. They can be anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe primary function of transportation disappears to give rise to other functions. It could be an extension of our homes or our offices or our local cafe.‚Äù

The concept of car ownership itself is under threat in a world dominated by autonomous vehicles. The line separating public and private transport will blur. You will see personal mobility go down the same route as other industries, from music, to news, by moving to a subscription model...

**‚ÄúTransport as a Service‚Äù (TaaS)**

Its the combination of two revolutionary technologies \[ Electric Vehicle and Autonomous Vehicle\] and a breakthrough business model \[Waymo, Uber, Lyft and dozens of others\].

Current car ownership model cost... $0.70 per mile.Future TaaS subscription model... $0.10 per mile

Electric Vehicle Maintenance: Every 100,000 miles

Electric Vehicle Life Span: !,000,000 miles

Moving Parts in a Combustion Engine Car: 2,200

Moving Parts in a Electric Vehicle: 20

The TaaS era is imminent. All cars sold by 2025 will be electric. By then, electric vehicles will be up to 10 times cheaper to operate and maintain than those with internal combustion engines powered by fossil fuels, making them ideal for fleet buyers... offering TaaS (Transportation as a Service) subscription.

Pennies where it's not about the pump and dump, but about the quality of the company itself and good financials/growth numbers.  Unfortunately folks often just see tickers and buy without knowing what they are getting into. People also sometimes forget that major companies traded as pennies at one point. Probably the most notable being Ford, but also Freddie Mac, SiriusXM, Monster, Pier 1, and many others. And some are trading as pennies now due to COVID. JCP being the most notable one posted about here as of late.

Now I'm not comparing BBRW to those companies, but seriously, do your DD on what you buy, and make sure if you are looking for a flip, you buy a pump and dump style penny, while if you are looking for actual investments, you look into the companies background, financials, structure, and more.",2020-05-13

It is a stronger indicator of resistance if you have more points touching it. When a stock rises above the amount at that horizontal line, it is breaking resistance at which point there's usually a hefty amount of selloff to follow 

Support is the same but for low. If the break continues to rise past the resistance, the resistance then becomes the new ""support"" in an uptrend, at which point you want to keep watching it and possibly set a stop loss at 5% below the old resistance (new support) to lock in profit. 
As for level 2, in my experience, if the bid is chasing up the ask, that's an indicator that the people selling are driving the price of the stock. Means the demand is surpassing supply, driving the price up. You can also sometimes see random whales. Say someone in there randomly bids 100k or 200k shares near the best ask price. If there's a couple, you may want to jump in but be ready to dump. Ignore the ones that are bidding 1mil shares at .0000001 or whatever.",2020-05-13

3792,evaxuate,fqif86x,/r/pennystocks/comments/gj4n5g/segn/fqif86x/,2,"yeah, basically a reverse split happens when a company wants to ‚Äúconsolidate‚Äù their stock price. they‚Äôll sort of combine shares of their company to be more valuable (proportionally) than the shares were before. 

so basically if you owned 50 shares of SEGN at $0.02 and a reverse split happened at a ratio of 1-50, in this case you would now have *one* share of SEGN at $1. you don‚Äôt actually lose any money, you just end up with less shares than you did before. 

the most common reason for a reverse split is to artificially increase the stock price (but not necessarily the company‚Äôs perceived or actual value) in order to not get delisted by the NYSE or NASDAQ. if a company‚Äôs stock price is under a dollar for a certain period of time (i forget how long), it‚Äôll be delisted. 

another reason can be to reduce the number of shareholders, because the volume of people invested in a company can change the way they‚Äôre governed by US law and/or the SEC. hope that helps!",2020-05-13

3855,unagimami,fqihyae,/r/pennystocks/comments/gj3v65/understanding_bid_ask_and_level_ii/fqihyae/,1,"Not particularly, Technical traders tend to look at support as a buy point and the resistance as more of a sell point. Breaking support can be an indicator of impending downtrend so unless there's DD indicating otherwise, people will often sell just below support to either cut losses or lock in profit if they've been holding for a couple runs in a consistent uptrend. 
When new highs are reached some people will set a trailing stop 5% below whatever new high is reached so you'll see a lot of stop losses triggered when price goes 5-10% below the new high. 
If there was recently a lot of volume and a new high, followed by long periods of low volume and downtrend, then a spike in volume with an uptrend, you can expect plenty of people holding the bag from the first spike to sell off at the 2nd spike or even before. 
Using resistance/support, I recommend doing some research on avoiding false breakouts. Ideally you want 2 or more points on a resistance or support line before you can put significant trust in it.",2020-05-13

I read their latest 10-Q (From November, have they seriously not put their year end financials together? They didn‚Äôt even have the 2019 quarterly statements audited so what are they waiting for?) and they‚Äôre not profitable. 

Plus they‚Äôre doing some really weird shit. Did y‚Äôall see that they decided to set up their HR department as it‚Äôs own subsidiary company? Like seriously. ‚Äúwe felt it necessary to create our own internal employee benefits and payroll services company called A4 Corporate Services, LLC [...] Bringing this into the Alpine 4 family of companies reduces our cost from $260k annually to just under $120k an annual cost savings of $140k.‚Äù 120k is like the salary of one HR director.

It's quite misleading and the info is a bit off. Your name is also doing you no favors haha.

But regardless.... here:

This is DD in this subreddit done by a very reputable individual with a proven track record and who is very active in the community discord:

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcdtct/alpp_going_to_run_on_revenue_report/

But effectively ALPP has seen consistent growth both as a company and in terms of revenue/partnerships while debt has decreased steadily. They have done a really good job setting up the company for success but it's still a work in progress but this year should be a banner year for them. 

The delay in the reporting is not honestly that surprising. If you look at filings, a huge amount of smaller size companies have been filing 8-K's for extensions because of COVID causing slowdowns in the procedures taken. Filing a 10k is not as easy as one thinks. Its also only a 5-15 day delay which in the grand scheme of things is minor. Its a long term investment stock so those of us buying in are thinking down the line in terms of how the company will grow.

I am certainly not trying to sell you on it though. Do your own DD, trust your own instincts. It's your money.",2020-05-13
