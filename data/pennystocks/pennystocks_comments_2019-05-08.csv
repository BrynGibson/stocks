173,A-Fat-Texan,emvx03m,/r/pennystocks/comments/bm94vj/wkhs/emvx03m/,1,"I’ve been in this stock for about 18 months at an average cost just under a dollar. This isn’t just a psychology play, here’s the basics:

Workhorse produces chassis for EV and next-gen hybrid trucks and vans, and also has a drone venture that is in the process of being sold.

NGEN-1000: Workhorse’s last mile delivery van that was designed to compete on the USPS fleet next generation delivery vehicle contract. Workhorse was named one of the 5 finalists last year. The contract is estimated to be worth $6B, and they have 1100 other orders for the van already. First deliveries are expected for Q4 this year.

W-15: Well before Rivian announced its pickup, the W-15 had already logged 4000 pre-orders. The project is currently on hold while the company focuses on the NGEN van, but will likely resume shortly after van production catches stride

Financing: Workhorse entered an agreement with Marathon Asset Management in February that gives them access to a $35MM line of credit, essentially enough to run the company for another year until they begin filling van orders.

Trump tweet: Workhorse is planning to buy a GM manufacturing plant in Ohio. In and of itself shopping for a plant isn’t unusual because other USPS contract bidders are doing the same, but Trumps involvement leaves some to speculate that Workhorse is the current front runner.

This is my little pet company in my portfolio and it’s fun to finally see people talking about it, even if r/pennystocks is just passing through.",2019-05-08

Majority used to go to ADS Tactical 90%. These 2019 DLS contracts are worth $4 billion and each of the 6 companies have an equal chance to solicit for these contracts. There are new solicitations each day.

So what happened is that the original ceiling was supposed to be $33 billion over a 10 year period (see link: https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/special-operations-equipment-soe-tailored-logistics-support-tls-spe8ej18r0001)

This did not happen because of the ADS Tactical debacle. They were getting kicked out and losing their small business status so which is why they awarded a BRIDGE contract for the next 365 days expiring on March 3rd 2020 or around there. Around that time, the dust should settle with ADS and then they'll be only 5 approved DLS/SOE certified companies. I am sure Unifire will be one of them.

Atlantic Diving Supply used to take 90% of the contracts so kicking them out was a big move. 2019 is the last time they'll be able to bid on these small business contracts. How can a company who made 2.5 billion last year be considered a small business? Good thing tthey kicked them out!

211,spoiler_dave,emzpvw3,/r/pennystocks/comments/bm85fm/bemg_at_04/emzpvw3/,1,Actually what they're doing is pretty brilliant. I'm not buying into the Uber/Lyft IPO nonsense because there's no direct correlation one way or another. What they're doing is more or less credit counseling and fast-pathing people that want to earn with Uber/Lyft to be able to afford newer vehicles (required by both companies in order to drive for them). They're doing this by working with dealers who have overstock and basically setting up short-term leases where the dealer gets paid and the customer gets to drive for Uber/Lyft and make money. It's a very interesting ecosystem. The same is true for the mortgage. When buyers are turned down (or will have to pay higher rates) because of credit rating issues Get Credit Healthy acts as an intermediary to the broker/lender and helps fix the consumers credit. In the meantime the consumer is paying GCH a certain amount per month for their services. They're making revenue already which can't be said for many of the bio-pharms out there with big promises and living on grants.,2019-05-08

The private placement that finished a month or two ago for 25cents makes for a good solid support.  I think once the news starts to flow and financials for unifire are released it will help investors feel more confident, will boost the price.  

Right now I think it is staying in the 25-30 cent range because it is not 100% clear how the 4 billion dollar bridge contract with Department of Defense is going to play out as it is shared amongst 6 players.  Atlantic diving supply used to receive the majority of the contracts, but they  tried to pull a fast one and has now lost their small business status.  

Even so historically unifire has received about 5% of the jobs in these bridge contracts, and that was before it had access to MRSs financing.  So 5% seems like a modest estimate to me since they now have more financing and Atlantic diving supply is out of the picture.  Do the math and that 200 mil.  And this isn't the only contract they are in.
