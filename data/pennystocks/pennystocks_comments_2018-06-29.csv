Get out of the game, or stop actively trading. If you are not an experienced and educated trader, actively trading is DANGEROUS.

The safest investing for anyone is putting money into an ETF or mutual fund and letting it ride. Putting money into a Schwab mutual fund or ETF through their website, no fees, no minimum investment into their Schwab funds, set to reinvest dividends automatically might be the best bet. Fidelity is a good company too, but their no fee funds have $2500 minimum. Or, if you like RBH, maybe a Vanguard ETF is a good idea. *I am in no way advertising or affiliated with any of these services for these companies but I am aware of different 401k style options.*
