I was in your exact position a few years ago. If I was advising myself, I‚Äôd have read more, watched more videos, and listened to more podcasts, read more before investing. If you want to do something now, opens a brokerage account (Schwab and TD are no-fee) and dump the $300 into VI (vanguard total market etf, same return [basically] as the index fund) and hold it.

2. Wait until it is 10.00 am before planning your entry, the first half hour is too volatile and you don't know who is in control of the market, bull or bears.
3. Use the 10 EMA and VWAP as your guide to decide  going bullish or bearish, candles should be on top of them to go long.
4. Only enter a trade with a fixed stop loss in mind (no more than 3% of your capital). Don't chase a price, and don't enter when a big green candle forms, wait for a pull back.
5. Exit when a red candle crosses the 10 EMA at 3 min
