10,"Aveda (AVE), the Canadian drill rig transportation company, has seen it stock price jump to CAD$0.97 following a CAD$0.90 offer from Daseke but with a CAD$0.45 contingent payout also on the table the returns look heavily skewed towards the upside.",8jod1g,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jod1g/aveda_ave_the_canadian_drill_rig_transportation/,5,0,"Aveda runs large flatbed trucks to move rigs from one location to another. It’s a specialized job, transporting large rigs is complicated and with rigs commanding high day rates typically in excess of $10,000 its usually urgent.

The business is cyclical but it currently appears to be in the early stages of an upswing. Demand is growing and supply is tight as OPEC reported yesterday that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, driven by plunging Venezuelan supply and Iran’s supply now looking doubtful.

The contingent payment will be paid as a multiple of 2.75 times annual EBITDA for 12 months to June 2018 in excess of $18 million. It is a number that has been growing strongly with FYE December 2017 EBITDA of $15.9 million up from $6.9 million in 2016 and guidance for Q1 EBITDA of $4.5 million up from $2.6 million last year.

With such growth a significant contingent payout looks likely. EBITDA of $27.6 million would result in a maximum payout of $0.45 per share. A recent Daseke presentation suggest Daseke expects to payout the full amount. But with the stock priced on CAD$0.97 the returns look skewed towards the upside with a CAD$0.90 payment almost assured (given large shareholder approvals) and returns of a further CAD$0.45 looking a real possibility.
