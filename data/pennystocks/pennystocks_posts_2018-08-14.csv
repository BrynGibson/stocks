A good move to ride the uptick IMO. 
LCLP been on a good move at the end of last week, it stayed steady yesterday, then moved another 44% in the right direction this morning. I am already up 80%. I would say check it out, and that it may be a good idea to try to throw some money at IMO. ",2018-08-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/979xt7/ayyeee_rhsn_lclp/
