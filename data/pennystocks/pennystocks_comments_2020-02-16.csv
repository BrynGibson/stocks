2,rodrigkn,fhsge18,/r/pennystocks/comments/f4ptw1/tullow_oil/fhsge18/,1,"South America is a gamble to invest in as emerging markets go. On one hand you could come out with 65% returns like some people did investing after the global recession. On the other hand you could end up with them nationalizing the industry. This is a particularly specific risk with oil as even democratic countries like Argentina did in 2015. Then throw in the recent political protests in both Peru and Chile which give rise to further economic instability. 

South America has fascinating volatility especially with commodities due to political risk which is why their stocks always trade low. However, that’s why emerging markets have had an on average ~30% return since 2009. 

TLDR: Worst case scenario you complain to your friends about how you lost it X amount because of some socialist asshole. I’d listen to that guy at a party.",2020-02-16
