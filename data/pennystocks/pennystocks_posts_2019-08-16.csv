18,Don't Buy Illiquid Stocks,cr86nr,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cr86nr/dont_buy_illiquid_stocks/,64,43,"I see many posts by those who get long into stocks that trade small amounts of money a day. These stocks can barely form an intraday chart, with a single trade made sporadically. Because of this, exiting a position will be incredibly difficult. I can't attest to those who risk little money, but opt to small returns. Most seem like wishful thinking. Pennystocks being any stock under $5, you'll be sure to find a liquid stock that's a good investment.

Happy trading! -
