Gulfport Energy is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids, or NGLs, in the United States. Their strategy is to internally identify prospects, acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling. Using this strategy, they have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves, as well as development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas prospects. The company’s principal properties are located in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio and the SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer plays in Oklahoma. In addition, they hold an acreage position along the Louisiana Gulf Coast in the West Cote Blanche Bay and Hackberry fields, an acreage position in the Alberta oil sands in Canada through their interest in Grizzly Oil Sands ULC and an approximate 21.9% equity interest in Mammoth Energy Services, Inc., a company that serves the electric utility and oil and natural gas industries. They seek to achieve reserve growth and increase cash flow through their annual drilling programs.

Gulfport Energy has a consistent history of being able to cash flow both the needs and the growth of its operations and this trend looks like it will continue into the foreseeable future. Their debt threshold has always been somewhat conservative and current financials mixed with future projections show that they will remain solvent. Since 2007, they have grown book value at an average annual rate of 34% compounded while also growing cash flow from operations 41% annually (Since 2014, book value has grown at 17% and CFFO has grown at 42%). I believe that if management can continue to grow book value at a rate of at least 10% annually over the next 3 to 5 years, Gulfport Energy’s current valuation makes it an extremely enticing investment. If we look back to 2014, the company had a book value of $3.6 Billion. Since then, that figure has almost doubled to $6.5 Billion. Today, the company currently sits at a valuation of less than $500 Million. To me, that’s insane whatever way you try to frame it.

I believe that with the company’s current financial position, future prospects, any slight uptick in the macro picture, and their current share repurchase program (up to 30% of all outstanding shares), this company could test all-time highs at some point in the next 5 to 7 years. I also see a buyout opportunity shaping up here. With the company’s valuation as suppressed as it currently is and the company electing to both repurchase shares and pay off debt, I believe the company could demand a (at a minimum) 40 to 50% premium in a buyout/merger situation. I see both short-term and long-term catalysts at play here that make Gulfport Energy and enticing company to add to your watchlist.

We currently hold shares in Gulfport Energy and hope to add more on any major declines.

One final point is that since 2017, the company has reduced its total outstanding shares by 13%. It is important to note that they are conducting their share repurchases at time of unprecedented undervaluation which to me shows they are extremely well versed in capital allocation and focused solely on shareholder returns.

Best wishes and good luck everybody!
