I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a professional (you ARE a professional, right?) to stay on topic instead of wedging his own ticker pick awkwardly into a separate conversation.  Usually I don't respond to these kind of temper tantrums, but I'd just like to point out that a true crypto king wouldn't stoop to chew out the hoi polloi, such as myself.  I understand its difficult though, being low on the crypto king pecking order at 94.  Keep reaching for that rainbow though, perhaps you will break 50.

But I digress - I fail to see how this stock is a better choice when it's currently filing for chapter 11 and has been served a delisting notice.  The CEO does claim that they have sufficient liquidity, but I remain skeptical at best.
