1,Swings for this week and stats on all previous stock calls,7tqha0,Ragefan66,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7tqha0/swings_for_this_week_and_stats_on_all_previous/,9,6,"These are the stocks I posted about on /r/robinhood on 1/16

MRDN called @ 1.10 now 1.12 

MBOT called @ 1.02 now 1.04, saw baby jump to 1.11. Could still see a jump, but chances are getting slim.

CAPR Called at 1.70 now 2.13, could still make it to original swing prediction @ 2.50

IDXG called at 1.09 now 1.14, this actually still looks lile a strong buy. Can hit 1.30 easily, watch for slight dip and buy is my advice

PTX called at 2.47 now 2.41. Also ditching this one, could see jump later but I've moved funds elsewhere for now. 

SMED called at 4.04, saw jump to 4.94, now 4.59


CYTR called at 1.77 now at 2.03, saw jump to 2.25.


Here are the swing calls for the next one-two weeks

MBRX -chart looks good for a small 10-20% rise, keep your eye on it

MBOT - if this is gonna pop it'll be before Feb probably, keep on radar for next few days.


SCON - this price level is ripe for another jump, very nice drop last week for watchers, if 1.09 holds I would recommend a strong buy.

CYTR - Keep on radar, could rise up to 2.50+ but will drop after it hits 2.50ish if it hits the PT. Sell after each rise and buy back the dip if this continues to look strong this week.


GLBS - The Greek Shitters (including the dreaded TOPS &amp; DRYS) will probably see some action this week. I see 10-20% very possible across the board, sell immediately after the rise as these will continue to drop and R/S after their infrequent jumps.


IDXG - Still looks like a strong contender from my first list. I don't see it falling below 1.05, as it should have solid floor around 1.07. Can very well run to 1.20+",2018-01-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7tqha0/swings_for_this_week_and_stats_on_all_previous/

They've got solid management, they're continuing to add to it, and the financial potential of their drugs is extremely strong in comparison to many of the other biotechs at this price point.  The big one for me is the Trike therapy that uses natural killer or NK cells.  Novartis received FDA approval for its cell therapy. This is great news but it comes at a cost of nearly $500,000 for a one-time treatment based on CAR-T being the therapy of choice.  GTBP's therapy is more customizable and designed for a much wider market application.  I know...very technical...but this is what I see.  GTBP is not an overnight ""hype"" stock.
