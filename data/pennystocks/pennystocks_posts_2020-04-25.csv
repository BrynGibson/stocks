This  by no means meant to be investor advice because I am half baked at the moment so do your own DD and don't take financial advise from Reddit. 

1. FDA Commissioner Dr Hahn says that Trump ordered any and all  barriers to market for anti body test be removed. Companies can self certify with an insert in packaging. There is no standard for what the accuracy has to be that I can find, only that they have to put an insert in packaging with test results in packaging to get approval that's it besides having a product obviously
2. South Korea started using an antibody test similar to DECN in December/January but was not very accurate but fast. DECN works heavily with these companies.
3. DECN decides that they can make and market these inaccurate tests under guise of FDA approval internationally and sales in USA
4. DECN decides to pump there stock with PR's with rookie mistakes that would get them halted
5. DECN gets halted then resumes ten days later stock tanks to maybe grey market  
6. DECN gobbles up millions shares at .01
7. DECN provides proof of FDA approval and product they go back to pink sheets and moons back up.
8. DECN continues to sell all products and life goes on for them

After hours of research I found a ton on this and there evil genius CEO. They put a lot of time and money into this for it to be pump and dump the CEO is not stupid he is pulling some shit I am sure of that but I am also sure that they have a product that can meet the BS standards of self certification. I think his long play is to buy up as many share as he can at .01 or as near to it as necessary then makes out like a bandit when his company moons on news and then what can anyone do if the product shit. its FDA approved and the testing result insert is in there in microprint he walks away with millions. this test is needed right now because Government needs these tests to get economy going. after all the BS this guys is pulled and got away with I have faith he will pull this off as well nlt the question is how do we profit as well",2020-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7qpc7/decn_fraud_figured_out_and_it_is_not_what_you/

Because if their job is to protect investors they failed miserably 

(SEC FAILURES &amp; policy violations in the case of $DECN)
[Paraphrasing]

-“If you’ve been monitoring since March, &amp; have validity/evidence to your claims, why wait until literally right after the shares up over 900% from their price at the time you begun pursuing these claims , after millions in volume, dollars and American people are invested, to take action ”?

-“I understand auditing (based on)/having problems the sales claims made in the PR the goal of 525million was an ambitious goal, but a pipe dream from the start ,for a company this size, but company’s make insane projections all the time that rarely live up to expectations.”
 
*which I explained Berman said in this current Pr we would do 1mill a month for the foreseeable future.

+these PR’s are very old, why wasn’t action taken sooner on behalf of the share holders of suspected of being fraudulent ?

- Why suspend over the technology based claim “technology perfected” if the product hasn’t even been tested by the FDA yet? 
*The SEC has no dealings in science and couldn’t validate or invalidate those claims if it wanted too.
-“All they can do is wait for the FDA, to scientifically disprove the claims, and since they didn’t make the claim of “falsifying FDA communications “ or lying about the serial number or filing (which we will be pursuing from the FDA ASAP), 

*(we can assume the filing was legitimate @ this point in time )&amp; if we go off Berman’s PR the kits haven’t been tested yet...

.Also per their OWN policy they notify a company before halting, why was Berman not notified of the potential of a suspension? And even if he was why was he allowed to put out the PR with no Halt to trading to protect investors?

I’m not even speaking for myself when I say , these times are too tough to have people money holed up over something you’re claiming to have known about... we must demand immediate answers from the SEC, no long played out process.",2020-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7o1jy/the_failures_of_the_sec_in_the_case_of_decn/

This is not a mean-spirited post; I really just want newer investors to have some common sense to think on before gambling the house on (*nano-cap stock of the day here*) at the height of its run and losing big.

# PENNY STOCKS ARE NOT SMART LONG-TERM POSITIONS

I don't care what so-and-so trading guru says to his chatroom of pumpers right before he dumps his shares minutes later and cashes in on their hype, DO NOT BUY PENNY STOCKS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SAFE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. With their level of volatility, penny stocks are *realistically* *only a worthwhile play for high-volume swing/momentum traders and pattern day traders* to make. You are not going to get rich years from now and turn 1000x profit by putting $200 into some $0.07 bio-pharma startup today. You just aren't.

# SET REALISTIC PRICE TARGETS

100%+ gain is NOT a realistic target. 50% gain is NOT a realistic target. 30% gain is NOT a realistic target. Get this get-rich-quick, I turned $400 into 40 million, make-one-trade-and-retire BULLOCKS out of your head NOW and stop watching your profits vanish into thin air because you expect the stock fairy to magically come down out of the sky and give you the golden ticker to fantasy land. Secure your profits when you see them. 5-15% GAIN IS A GOOD TRADE, so set your damn Stop Loss and be thankful you ended up in the green. No, you're not a ""penny flipper."" No, you don't have ""weak hands"" or whatever the fuck the daft chucklefucks on StockTwits and DECN threads are calling it. You have **money**. You have the results of a good trade in your brokerage account. It doesn't matter if the stock goes up more. It doesn't matter if the stock goes down to $0.00 the next day. You are out of it with what you intended to get out of it, and you're now in a position to make your next trade. Good stocks don't just suddenly disappear out of the market because you took your gains a little early and the stock you sold pulled a miracle run and went up another 30% after you left. DO NOT TRADE WITH EMOTION. TRADE WITH STATISTICS.

# DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE

Do not buy a stock because somebody posts ""$*SHIT about to BLAST OFF to MOON LAND get your ROCKETS and LAMBOS ordered guyss!! LOLOLOL.*"" That is not DD. Look up the company you're buying into, look at recent news about the company you're buying into, and please - **if there's only one bit of DD you do, make it this** \- LOOK AT THE PATTERN THE STOCK IS CURRENTLY TRADING ON A PROPER CANDLESTICK CHART AND TRADE ACCORDINGLY. Do not invest in stocks that do not pass common-sense inspection. You will lose your money nearly every single time. If it's too good to be true, it is. If the one-in-a-million situation comes up where it was true, it still doesn't matter to you because you were off making good money on a much better trade and you didn't even come back to notice. ***Ignore the chatter, buy the pattern***.

# IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE BASICS OF TRADING, DON'T FUCKING TRADE YET!

If you have to ask how to read a candlestick chart, what a stop loss is, how to place a limit order, what ''ETF'' stands for, when the market is open, etc. - YOU ARE NOT READY TO TRADE. I do not understand this. You wouldn't attempt to race a car on a speedway without knowing how to drive, you wouldn't attempt to perform heart surgery without advanced medical training, so why on earth would you sit back and put your money at risk without knowing what you're getting into? There are plenty of FREE resources on YouTube that cover the basics of tradings, chart patterns, market terminology, all of it. You're not going to start off with the experience of a 30-year veteran broker, but you at least need to know the core of what you're doing before you start buying and selling shares. If searching for information on your own bores you or is too complicated or time-consuming, then trading isn't for you anyway.

# DON'T RISK WHAT YOU CAN'T LOSE

As with all risky ventures, there is always the chance that you will log on to your brokerage platform and see that your account has significantly less value than it did mere moments ago. While following your common sense, doing good DD, and only trading stocks that have good patterns shown in their charts will minimize this chance by a very large amount, it can still happen. Good trades can fail. Bad trades can win. The market can be fickle. Penny stocks aren't the place to be investing your retirement fund or the money you got from taking out a mortgage.

# DON'T TRADE ON ROBINHOOD

This is really going to rub some people the wrong way, but that's fine. I'm not going to get into why RH lacks certain features that make trading easier because you'll find that out on your own in time. The main reason I've added this to the list is much simpler - RH only lets you trade from 9:00 AM EST to 6 PM EST. You will miss out on most non-market hours moves. I personally use Webull, which allows you to trade from 4 AM EST to 8 PM EST and also offers 0-commission trading in the same manner that RH does. Also, if you plan on trading OTC stocks (which I can't honestly recommend), you will need a broker that supports them. RH doesn't. Find one that does - but be ready to pay commissions on those trades.

# CHECK THE DATE OF A POST BEFORE YOU BUY A STOCK

I've had people post hate on stock watch list ideas I've posted nearly a week after I posted them. If a post on January 5th says ""\[STOCK\] is looking good for a run"" and you look the stock up on January 14th and see it went up 35% between January 7th and January 8th, chances are good that the post is no longer actively valid advice. This should be common sense, but unfortunately some people completely ignore the date on time-sensitive news.",2020-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7z1w7/a_list_of_reminders_for_new_traders/

55,The posts about DECN are missing the point,g7xd2o,jus_in_bello,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7xd2o/the_posts_about_decn_are_missing_the_point/,1,5,"Disclaimer: I'm a bag holder. I broke my own rule and got sucked into the FOMO. Lesson learned. I'm also a new investor, so please correct me if any of the following is incorrect. 

A lot of the posts about DECN explore whether the company is legit or shady. There seems to be some hope among other DECN holders that the company just got caught up with other COVID scammers and will eventually be cleared. There is even some people claiming to have talked to the owner and, based on his response, everything is going to be okay. No, it will not. 

The SEC does not issue a suspension lightly, and the fact that they did in this case supports my belief that there is some credibility to the question of fraud. However, my belief doesn't matter, and if you believe the SEC was in the wrong, good for you. The fact remains the same - the stock is now almost certainly worthless. 

Here's why. An SEC suspension is a near death sentence for OTC stocks. While the stock is suspended, it will be delisted and move to what's called the Grey Market. Sure, after the suspension is lifted trading can resume, but buyers and sellers will not be able to see what the bid/ask prices, meaning, you're trading blind. If you're selling, you list the stock at whatever price you think there is a buyer for and hope for the best. And, that's IF your broker even honors your order to sell, which they are not obliged to do. Indeed, your broker may just stop listing the stock altogether. The vast majority of SEC suspended stocks that resume trading on the grey market eventually die out. 

Is there hope? Not much. Yes, it's possible for a stock to resume trading normally. However, it will take some strict hurdle jumping and a lot of time. Even then, history is not on DECN's side. Since 2010, some 3,400 stocks have been suspended by the SEC and less than five have gotten off of the grey market. I could only find three - EDVP (now PRLX), SDRG (which no longer trades after a second suspension), and PHOT. 

TL:DR - Regardless of if DECN is a legit company or shady, the stock is worthless.",2020-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7xd2o/the_posts_about_decn_are_missing_the_point/

Things changed. The mood took a dark turn. What was once the blissful opportunity to make money, all gone. Sweating. Shaking. Heart pounding. It's all over. The dream of a blissful prospect, vanished.

Dead silence.
