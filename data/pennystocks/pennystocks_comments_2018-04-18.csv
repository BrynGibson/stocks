Mission Ready has the ability to work with a well respected IR company to promote their product better than they were able to internally. 


For investors, this is one more step the company has taken to prepare for a major production increase to accommodate for increase in sales. Additionally with the promotion video being shown to the world, there will be alot more eyes watching this stock moving forward. 

On April 24th, there is an Investors Meeting. While sales are expected to be very low for the first quarter, keep your eyes on this meeting for more positive news",2018-04-18

I am a taking a loss currently on it but earnings should be kind of ridiculous for the stock price. It also has a low float.

38,AlligatorRaper,dxmgmll,/r/pennystocks/comments/8d5lt2/omvs_news_out/dxmgmll/,1,"Expanding on this a bit, the 23 million or about in debt is not exactly as it seems.  First, 19 million came with the old ticker OMVS when Robotic Assisted Devices did a reverse merger with the shell OMVS.  The debt from derivative liabilities comes in the form of convertible debentures (shares of the company at a discount if no repayment). In the following nine months of after the merger, the new OMVS acquired an additional 3 million in debt, mostly convertible debentures ,not too bad for a tech startup. 


What concerns me is that fact that the old shell carried over some much debt. Why would anyone acquire that shell? Also, the shells former owners seem to still have their fingers in the pot and they have a shady past. I think Steve the CEO of rad is a good guy with a great product that stepped in shit with the shell acquisition and is sorting through the mess. 

I've been holding 75,000 shares just waiting for something to happen with the Qs and the 10k. I went from excited to waiting patiently to annoyed. I started to get angry it was taking so long to come out, then I just lost hope and mostly forget about OMVS. I'm still uncertain if this is a good company. There is so much conflicting information and opinions it's hard to see the truth in it all. ",2018-04-18
39,ckeith7,dxmlcql,/r/pennystocks/comments/8d5lt2/omvs_news_out/dxmlcql/,1,"It is a bit strange. I know Steve got cash up front from Parsons when he moved into OMVS and he has full control of the company. Parsons already has relationships with the lenders and could maybe have made it cheaper for RAD to pay off the notes than it would be for RAD to directly list on the exchange. Also gives Steve more control than if he were to IPO. 

Just my thoughts. ",2018-04-18
