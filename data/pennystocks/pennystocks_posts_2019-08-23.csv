Boca Raton, FL (Access Wire ‚Äì August 23, 2019) Universal Media Group Inc.

Mike Sherman, the CEO of Universal Media Group Inc. (OTC:UMGP) and creator of ‚Äú**Before The Fame‚Äù, a celebrity documentary television series produced out of Miami, FL, that takes you down memory lane of today‚Äôs biggest stars in music, sports and entertainment, will be debuting the highly anticipated episode of one of the most legendary music groups of all time, The ‚ÄúBee Gees ‚Äú.**

Mike Sherman has previously produced Before The Fame TV shows featuring **DJ Khaled, Pitbull, Lil Wayne, Mike Tyson, Dwyane Wade** as well as many others. However when the opportunity arose to

üì∑

produce an episode on Bee Gees, Mike jumped at the chance.

‚Äú I grew up listening to the ‚ÄúBee Gees‚Äù. They were the biggest music band in the world at the time. Every kid to our parents would listen to their music as it transcended all generations. I mean you couldn‚Äôt get enough! The music industry was changing and the ‚ÄúBee Gees‚Äù played the songs we all wanted to hear. Still up and until this day, whenever I here a Bee Gees song on the radio, I immediately think back to a place in time and remember exactly what I was doing when that song came out. The ‚ÄúBee Gees‚Äù are true musical icons and their songs will live in our hearts forever, ‚Äúemphatically says Mike Sherman.

Mike Sherman is hosting the show with Michael Gibb, the son of Barry Gibb, the lead singer of the ‚ÄúBee Gees‚Äù. Mike Sherman figured that a son would naturally have vast, intimate knowledge of his father. He is the youngest boy in the Gibb family and sheds some light on his father‚Äôs legacy in music as well as on Michael Jackson, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The program is filled with exciting never before seen photos, exclusive footage and commentary typical of the manner in which Mike Sherman showcases various artists.

Mike plans on doing upcoming shows featuring The Rolling Stones, Alicia Keys, Derek Jeter and many more.

‚ÄúThere are so many icons in this world that our audience would love to see. Doing these short documentaries will shed some light on some of the most influential and iconic individuals in all of sports, music and entertainment. I believe we can produce entertaining programs for all genres to enjoy,‚Äù exclaims Mike.
