Cannabidiol (CBD) is the part of the cannabis plant that doesn't get you “high” like the THC side of the plant. It is typically used for health reasons instead of for recreational purposes. The CBD products are either derived from industrial hemp plants or marijuana plant. CBD is being touted as a natural remedy for chronic pain, insomnia, depression and anxiety, among other conditions. The research to prove CBD’s therapeutic outcomes is still largely forthcoming. But even without the science, adults over 50, who suffer most from these conditions, are behind one of the fastest growing market segments for CBD products, reports Forbes.

In February, a peer-reviewed study of almost three thousand patients in Israel, the first study of its kind, showed that cannabis can be safe and effective for seniors, and lead to decreased use of pharmaceuticals, including opioids. In the study, published in the European Journal of Internal Medicine, almost ninety-four per cent of patients reported improvement in their condition, with their pain level reduced by half.

Another study, this time conducted by HelloMD and Brightfield Group, analyzed CBD use in 2,400 members of the HelloMD community. 42% of CBD users said they were able to stop using traditional painkillers such as Tylenol and prescription medication such as Vicodin. 80% said they found CBD to be either 'very or extremely effective.'",2019-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ao7nig/ncap_northsight_capital_to_start_distribution_of/

I personally have shopped at the stores an have $600 in clothing. I love the brand.

## Additional CBD products are expected to be launched this quarter

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Feb. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE – Wanderport Corporation (OTC: [WDRP](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gqBAsczu8ofc31hl7hKfbju2hsgdj6r-BBTGIeMmIKjyrY28xh5SudzTzBnX-Zs6IS_So42_KTkx2d4B7ahv6gsZaQO9A_BAUghsDo9aa2E=)), a premier manufacturer and distributor of food, beverages and consumer products made with hemp, is pleased to provide an update on its recent business development.  


Following President Trump's signing of the Farm Bill legalizing Hemp last December, Wanderport has seen significant increases in online and retail sales of its hemp and CBD coffee and teas.  The Company had also received more inquiries for wholesaling and private labeling of its premium CBD products.

Sapa Coffee and Teas are premium coffee and teas blended with either hemp or hemp cannabidiol (CBD).  Hemp CBD is legal and has no THC, the psychoactive ingredient found in cannabis.  Sapa Coffee is available in multiple flavors as well as in ground and whole beans.

Through a minority owned and affiliated entity, Sipp Industries (OTC: SIPC), the Company also offer Hemp Brown Ale and Hemp IPA.  The Hemp IPA is currently available in Illinois in both kegs and cans in nearly 100 locations.  The sales have been strong and the demand continues to grow as new customers are signed on at a brisk pace.  The two entities are also actively working to make the beers available nationwide in the near future.

Collaboration with a local craft brewer to produce a coffee beer is on-going.  Wanderport is currently working to secure local distributors and expects to launch the beer sometime this quarter.

Efforts have also been made in the development of several new CBD wellness and food and beverage products which the Company plans to launch in early second quarter.

The Company is being positioned as an operating as well as a holding company that consists of various wellness and food and beverages entities.  The near term goal of the Company is to consolidate and collectively create a greater shareholder value through an uplist to a fully reporting entity.

“Wanderport is embarking on an exciting expansion phase and we are very optimistic of the growth potential of both our existing and future product lines.  The recent positive development in the hemp industry is also presenting many attractive business opportunities which we intend to fully capitalize,” commented Lilianna Vo, President and interim CEO.",2019-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ao6r6e/wdrp_wanderport_gearing_up_to_support_recent/

NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE - Life On Earth, Inc. (OTCQB: LFER) is pleased to announce that one of its beverage brands, JUST CHILL® was recently featured in The Washington Post’s “Voraciously” Section, a section of the newspaper which provides its readers step-by-step recipes, and how-to articles focused on food, beverage and lifestyle topics.  


The article was entitled “I tried a dozen stress-relief snacks, tinctures and teas. So why am I still anxious?”, and the full article can be found at the following link: [www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2019/01/14/i-tried-a-dozen-stress-relief-snacks-tinctures-and-teas-so-why-am-i-still-anxious/?utm\_term=.3da2803fbe95](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0PyNmoTpXbMG2BWc42paMdV2K617_iWJNf7REYJ_LDJWJFPjKR-tRi7IDUk2-DMBj7bLuuI6lVGHmP-B5472HzNucz79huxDz2iJH2ecRPLcR0EvJ1FgAY3bkCRc2ItPUX68A1GKmhanlVpQEWfiAAmBBXPqXb00lQfBnNF8Ehkh3da1gJZazW7YEP3FId6wRUpD9E4bAYdgzAqKJIWji0FBxJhRD3bEH9A1ZGzoThadsHooIKuSadUjKMtc4bFRb4UYx5SUs11jnAX-c-rS_wLfyu2OAd2tF8EtYJhqgEjNP-lFHogZ6NxUHoDV6JQPT0UdZfw8VNLhoWIYcdVUjqbdTyHcHMyxUMk-yIXXAPJAAi1NSPf2q0asM7kYPvbEUAZoqFuSyuSrF3H2I5O_J2x3DmCZ8HHcZP7C6sk7h7qrzDymyifQjklIIp4HLLmzBK3y7Ynf4-AKkPVzxs5PfA==)

The article explores the pressures of modern living and the new food and beverage products, that have come to market, that may functionally alter one’s mood to decrease anxiety. The functional ingredients being explored in these products are cannabidiol (commonly known as CBD), and L-Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea.  According to the article, certain studies on L-Theanine “have found it increases levels of serotonin and dopamine, the brain chemicals that enable feelings of happiness and pleasure. It has also been shown to have an anti-stress effect by blocking cortical neuron excitation.” L-Theanine is the lead active ingredient in JUST CHILL® beverages.

“We are so pleased that one of the country’s largest newspapers highlighted one of our products in a story that explores functional food and beverages that help alleviate anxiety,” said Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo, the CEO of Life On Earth, Inc.  He also added, “We believe JUST CHILL® is an emerging leader in this new calmness category, which also includes beverages with CBD as an active ingredient.  We are looking forward to additional line extensions to broaden out our product offering in this space.”

24,Banco Sabadell?,ao2rk8,kdyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ao2rk8/banco_sabadell/,1,7,"First time posting on Reddit and this is also one of my first stock buys.

I bought 99.78 units of SAB.MC at 0.88 dollars, I later learned that it was something called a “penny stock” which I later searched at Google which said penny stock companies are at risk of going bankrupt.
