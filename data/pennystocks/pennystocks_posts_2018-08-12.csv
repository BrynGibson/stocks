0,Possible Nano-Cap Speculative Play - $RGSE,96sf5n,ashimara,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/96sf5n/possible_nanocap_speculative_play_rgse/,18,2,"## $RGSE [also posted in stocks]

Yes, I’m serious. Quit Laughing.

This stock burned a lot of people over the last few years. Why do I think this stock is interesting now?

**Positives**

* The Dow Solar shingle that they have licensed is now industry leading and has one of the best cost to energy generation [https://www.roofingcalc.com/bipv-solar-shingles-cost/](https://www.roofingcalc.com/bipv-solar-shingles-cost/)
* The reason their share price fell drastically is that they had to dilute for in arrears &amp; operational funding at the same time. The big Series A convertible note has either just been paid off in full, or will be in the next few days ($10.75M total). This may be a press release or part of earnings. This will significantly reduce dilution rate because all in arrears notes are paid off.
* Revenue is catching up to operational costs – they already released their preliminary quarterly results. 33% Q2/Q1 increase in sales. 60%+ decrease in operation loss (down to roughly $1M. (source [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rgs-energy-receives-9-8-123100964.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rgs-energy-receives-9-8-123100964.html))
* Volume is healthy. There will be inertia at small gains but should be no resistances.
* Their main product should receive UL Certification in the next few weeks which allows them to install their projects on the wait list.
* They are about to hit $100M in reservations for sales and just increased their capacity with a logistics firm partnership. $100M in reservations for a company which currently has a $15M market cap is pretty attractive. I would not be surprised if another company acquired them.
* Regulatory environment and cost vs ROI are finally in solar's favor

**Negatives**

* Management seems decent, not great. Older PRs were out-of-market and frankly stupid/misleading.
* There will be a conversion rate associated with the project reservations. Not all projects will be converted into revenue. Solar projects are getting better but financing can still be an issue.
* Dilution will continue for operations in the near term. Rate may change significantly if the company does not hit milestones. However, near term rate should be low based off of the small and decreasing operational losses.
* Delisting Notice (though this doesn’t effect my near term play)
* Never know what will happen day-to-day with environmental policies or tariffs

Please Note – use 45M shares outstanding for any of your short term diligence or technical planning

My play – I hope to purchase shares in the low to mid 0.30s SP. 50,000 to 100,000 shares. (I already have quite a few from Friday). I intend to swing trade through the positive catalysts listed above. My exit point will be based on momentum, perceived dilution, and PR strength. If UL hits &amp; Sales Reservations are above $100M is announced I will probably leave around half of my basis long term for long term growth or possible acquisition. I like this stock because I think down side will be manageable and August/September upside might be 50%+.",2018-08-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/96sf5n/possible_nanocap_speculative_play_rgse/
