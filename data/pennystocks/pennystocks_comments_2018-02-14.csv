I've read advice that said you should have more than 20 grand to day-trade. Also I think it's actually illegal to day trade if you don't have 25k nowadays. If I was going to do that, I'd essentially have most of that 25k in not very risky stocks and be able to take it out for living money. And like maybe 5 grand in risky stuff. I've never seen anybody recommend penny stocks. They're almost always terrible investments. Everyone is waiting for a pump and dump to go along with the ride. These companies are never profitable, and they're always in a lot of debt. 

Technically speaking, it's *not* worth it to trade penny stocks. But it *can* be. You just have to be really lucky. The reason people do them is because if you get the right one, they can go up 10-20% in a day, occasionally more. ",2018-02-14

I have found a lot of stock in this app that’s below a dollar. For example I could buy 50 shares for $10 with a stock.. Obviously bitcoin started out at $15.

I don’t see why you couldn’t invest every now and then into the app and buy 50+ shares of a cheap stock that’ll maybe one day blow up. I’m not looking to drop thousands. At some point I’ll definitelt put a few hundred in but I’m not going to put $10K into an app. ",2018-02-14

Yes.  You can.  I don't know why you needed to ask a group on the internet if you can or should spend $10.  Also, the /pennystocks thing - just because things are available for a few cents doesn't make them 'pennystocks' in the normal usage of the phrase.
