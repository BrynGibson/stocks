I’m very very HIGH on a current play I’m on GLFH 

It’s somehow been a long term hold. I post on iHub with people there. I’ve never actually pumped this stock up to anyone honestly cause I legitimately like to buy more when I get money since it’s still relatively unknown lmao 

Check it out some time. Just a summary;

-SEC filer - 10k audited from outside agency (always a +) 
-recently removed all convertible debt (shows commitment to shareholders)
- recently acquired a positive revenue streaming company 
- *posted projection for 0.04 EPS and 8 mil revenue at end of year (makes valuation of company by end of year possibly around 0.80 if they hit their mark) 
- CEO actually answers people - I spoke to him once on the phone and he encouraged me to call back any time, but I’m secretly afraid to cause I don’t want to sound like an airhead lol

It’s a relatively new company that to me has made some attempts to get some traction over the years and hasn’t quite been successful until now, but for a new CEO mid/late last year and now they are really starting to generate some good momentum. 

10k filing for 2017 and 8ks from this year (they bought the new company in 18’ so it’s not in the 2017 10k sadly) are online. Give them a read. Share structure is great too with a low float that moves on air. When the next PR drops - 10Q - it will fly. Pretty quiet company and don’t post fluff piece PRs so this is the peace before the storm when they release the 10Q from their first quarter with their newly acquired business they bought in January. 10Q is due mid May so I’m loading up.

Oh and 1 huge thing in the 10k that some people skim over. Galenfeha (GLFH) bought their new business for 1$ and instead sold them shares. Sooooo if the company wants to make this purchase worth it - they will have to do some good work :)

Insiders in the company have 2 series of shares locked up: some at 0.45 and others at 3.50!!!! Sooooo they can’t even sell until we make money lol.

Chart has been pretty steady as a rock for 3 months + (coincided with when the new CEO took over) it’s recently been coming down a bit but check this out for yourself throughout the day and on L2s. Someone is working hard to short this to collect more shares. It gets painted down in the morning and at the end of the day with weak ass “ask slaps” when someone drops the ask and thus lowers the PPS. I always love the shorts cause they help me get more hands on shares so to each their own

This probably isn’t one that is a sexy flipper day reader type of stock. It’s a steady climber - real company making good moves and this one is stair stepping up in the right direction. 10Q keeps that momentum going and probably very quickly. Shorts are shaking the tree and his is sub .20 now which puts this as a strong buy. Accumulation is steady UP ; RSI is 55. It’s all setting up for a bounce back because the buying pressure is gonna be too heavy to hold it back. Very good alternative and sure thing compared to keeping money in the big boards right now with how volatile they are. 

Long term hold!

0.04$ EPS + 8 mil revenue for rest of the year projection 
Realistic 20 PE put this at 0.80 PPS by end of year if they meet projections (20 PE x 0.04 EPS) 

0.80 PPS trading at 0.17 today - love it. Loading up! Take it all with a grain of salt; thought I’d share
