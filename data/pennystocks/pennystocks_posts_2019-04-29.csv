&gt;*‚Ä¶.going into May, we have been looking at upgrading our price targets for* ***Aphria****,* ***Curaleaf*** *and* ***BANGI inc****., due to a number of factors, but focusing on the recently large deal undertaken by Canopy growth. From this, they have changed the game so signifcantly that the Cannabis companies closely behind them will need to race to a) file for patent protection on specific products, and b) announce their own significant deals to stay relevant in the industry. This is now in addition to emerging Cannabis companies such as BANGI inc., who will be focusing on debt reduction, and an increase in cannabis property holdings.*",2019-04-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/biphce/cobi_apha_and_curlf_receive_price_upgrade_for_may/
