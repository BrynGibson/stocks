2,$LPTX; is it another pump and dump?,b4ried,hogdur,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4ried/lptx_is_it_another_pump_and_dump/,26,26,First ever post on Reddit so bare with me. Heard about LPTX on here early last week and got super hyped after following what happened with $BPTH. Did a bunch of my own research and it made LPTX sound very promising. I bought in around 1.8 last Thurs/Friday and decided to hold on thru the craziness of Monday. Just wondering if anyone else made the same move as me and what your thoughts are. ,2019-03-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4ried/lptx_is_it_another_pump_and_dump/

News is coming out about a multi-million dollar merger which should send this to another 52 week high. Hoping for at least .5. If you get in now at .0129 then a .5 is surely worth it. Some say this will eventually hit .25, however be smart and take your money and run under .1",2019-03-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4zzqj/vshc_boom_week_has_come/

12,Weekly stock recap $JAGX $DARE $VXRT $SPI,b4vns1,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4vns1/weekly_stock_recap_jagx_dare_vxrt_spi/,3,0,"We got another week when healthcare sector stocks moved, especially these biotech stocks which are the majority of the healthcare sector's stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

But in comparison to what we witnessed past weeks the stocks getting slower a bit and it seems micro and nano-cap stock space getting back to normal rhythm. There are less easy opportunities to catch.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's now look at the main stocks that made big moves this week.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are like to watch the video rather than read check the recap video here: [https://youtu.be/HsY9FrkY9XM](https://youtu.be/HsY9FrkY9XM)

&amp;#x200B;

$JAGX the classic nano cap runner. The success in day trading penny stocks lies in the skill to catch momentum NANOCAP runner like $JAGX. If you are observing these stocks for some time you know that micro caps are not the big runners when comparing to nanocap stocks. Due to their size, these nano caps are the real runner and you should be focusing on them if you are interested in day trading multiple hundred percentages gaining stocks. As well there were no news associated with the move and this should not be something you should worry about while day trading is more technical based trading anyways. Positive news can help bring more attention from the general public which is great but the volume is anyways better predictor of such moves. So be more focused on volume rather on the news when day trading nanocap runners.

&amp;#x200B;

$DARE &amp; $SPI. I will talk about both of them while these stocks have the same feature in common which is observed can allow you to protect your downside if you are interested in day or swing trading by buying stocks or if you are interested in short selling these penny stocks. So the common feature is a big gap! I as well cautioned people not to buy $DARE after it gapped while big gaps are better predictors of the sell-off rather than buying opportunity. Same goes with $SPI and as well that this stock is former spiker/runner. Remember when trading micro and nao cap niche that big gaps should be looked with caution except if you are interested in short sell these stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

$VXRT was stock that I still included in this week's recap because it was a good stock example of what to actually avoid if you are interested in buy big runners. This stock was a better short selling opportunity rather than buying because of the volatility. So to explain this in simple language, what do I mean by that? If you would look at $VXRT intraday chart price structure (I used 5 minutes candle chart) you would see that in first 10 minutes after market open this stock just jumped too fast without actually building momentum as $JAGX did. Due to such big volatile jump buying this stock is more like gambling rather than trading strong price action. The best way to trade this stock was to short sell it after it popped.

&amp;#x200B;

To finish here I would like to tell that in my opinion stock indices will move lower in upcoming weeks so be prepared and I do believe because of this we should see less easy opportunities in penny stock niche. But remember you can short sell stocks and make money on the way down and if you interested in buying you should wait for a better time but be ready because opportunities will without any doubt come back.",2019-03-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4vns1/weekly_stock_recap_jagx_dare_vxrt_spi/
