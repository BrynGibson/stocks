There might be some upward runs if there is enough people pumping but I wouldn't be depending on that too much. Over time I have learned that hope in pennystocks is a very tricky thing to rely on. I have held many stocks after runs like this hoping it would continue only to see my balance drop. Do your research and follow the facts and most important buy the rumor and sell the news don't try to hold into anticipation of great news as you can see today the court news was not big enough to cause a big change.

**Thoughts on $YRIV**

The Yangtze River is the main river the Chinese use for commercial transport. This company is located in the Wuhan region, which also is the geographical middle major cities such as HaErbin, WuLumuqui, and ShangHai. 

This company is legitimately established along the river, and they‚Äôve acquired the property rights and licensing to begin developing major projects.

- 8 cargo ship docking spaces, capable of holding up ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 tons.

- Warehouse Container Zones

- Railroad loading zones that connect coastal China to mainland Europe.

Their goal is to complete three phases of logistics and development within 5 years.

**Summary**

Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited is in a great position in multiple avenues.

**International Trade**

- There is finally reasonable expectation that the United States and China will resolve trade disputes and come to an agreement. The speculated time frame within 4 weeks time.

**Lawsuit**

- $YRIV would not have started such a heavy lawsuit against the Hindenburg unless they and their legal team were confident in $YRIV‚Äôs chances of winning. The particular language and wording they used is very aggressive.

**Insider Trading**

- The CEO himself has over **91 Million shares**

- 7 individual shareholders own **68.3 Million shares**

- The 7 shareholders also filed a class action lawsuit against the Hindenburg immediately after $YRIV filed theirs


**Summary**

During the lawsuit, $YRIV will be able to reveal its actual assets to the world and drive the Hindenburg to the ground.  Once shareholders regain confidence in the rest is history. Combine this with new international trade agreements and massive port development, we‚Äôve got ourselves a sleeping giant.

Although there are other treatments available, chemo, BCG, etc... all offer terrible side effects. Furthermore, the patients we're treating are the ones that have become unresponsive to these treatments and are about to have their bladders removed. Guess what? we 2 patients are 12 months free of cancer, with no adverse side effects and get to keep their bladders :)

2) Their drug is 200x more effective than other FDA approved PDCs (photofrin)

And any ""analyst"" saying this could rise to $23 a share is either drunk/high and deserves to be shamed. Don't buy into that. The company's financials are in very dire straits and it has a lot of debt on its books. No way this will rise to $23 unless an act of god happens.",2019-04-05
