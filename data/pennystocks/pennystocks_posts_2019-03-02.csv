2,So much news last week but so little discussion.,awksu1,IrRoscoeMr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/awksu1/so_much_news_last_week_but_so_little_discussion/,38,40,"If noone is going to post this weekend..

SNMN, KYNC, and of course LEAS had great news last week. That's just 3 that I'm following.

I mean damn, I caught SNMN randomly because of the volume sold. Got in at .0005 and sold half at .0011.  (Relatively small position) I also made a bad buy target on FTEG but averaged down. I watched my VYST and UITA struggle to exist. LEAS I'm holding and praying to pay off my house. 

Downvote if you want but does anyone want to discuss some potential movers or some plays that you made that aren't just a stock that is waiting on liscense to distribute mj or entering the exclusive market of sellers of amazon ;).",2019-03-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/awksu1/so_much_news_last_week_but_so_little_discussion/
3,Been in Nak since 0.55,awhvb6,deedaveid,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/awhvb6/been_in_nak_since_055/,33,25,What are your opinions on NAK? It's only a $1000 I invested and I've had good runs with pennystocks going completely nuts or just LB type shit. I really feel this could run to the $50 range in our lifetime. Is there any reason to think it wouldn't?,2019-03-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/awhvb6/been_in_nak_since_055/
