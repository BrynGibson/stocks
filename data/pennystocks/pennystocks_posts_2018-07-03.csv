3,LIFE - aTyr Pharma,8vputr,BusyNess101,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8vputr/life_atyr_pharma/,0,2,"Short version: I am in rather heavy due to recent DD and analyst opinions.  Current cost basis @ 1.02 

Still have a little room to buy more but pretty close to maxed out on what I’d invest here.  

Recent news on phase 1 data released and the SP declined.  Zacks still has this listed as a buy with a decent short term outlook.  

I’m not overly concerned yet but am a little nervous— the SP has tested .85 several times in the last few
Sessions and has declined for consecutive sessions.

I really don’t want to take a loss here but also want to think  about my exit strategy.

Anyone else following LIFE?",2018-07-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8vputr/life_atyr_pharma/
