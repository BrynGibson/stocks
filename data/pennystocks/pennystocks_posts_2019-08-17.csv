1,Looking to hear opinions on Xebec Adsorption (TSX.V $XBC.V),crfufd,m94m,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/crfufd/looking_to_hear_opinions_on_xebec_adsorption_tsxv/,3,11,"I came across this company researching clean energy in Canada. This company has a few product lines, but the one that grabs my attention is their biogas purification products. For those that aren't familiar with it, Biogas are gasses produced from organic materials breaking down. Xebec's technology filters these gasses by removing the carbon and using the methane as a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). RNG is becoming a huge thing as climate change becomes a more important topic. This company just reported 2019 Q2 revenue of $12m a 140% increase from Q2 2018 of 5m. I have done a ton of reading on this company and the industry over the last couple of day and do believe this can go on a run. Interested in hearing others opinions. Feel free to ask questions, as I said I have done a lot of reading on this type of stuff and would be happy to try and answer.

I do not own this stock. Yet.",2019-08-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/crfufd/looking_to_hear_opinions_on_xebec_adsorption_tsxv/

4,My DD on General Moly ($GMO),crnrlw,BiotechStockPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/crnrlw/my_dd_on_general_moly_gmo/,6,11,"$GMO is an interesting Molybdenum mining company that hasn't started mining yet.  They own an 80 percent stake in the Mt. Hope mine in Nevada.  Considered to be one of the largest and highest grade Moly mines in the world.  The market value of their assets is enormous.  Mt. Hope alone contains over 1 billion pounds of Molybdenum. 

They've recently suffered a drop in price because their Chinese partner Amer bailed on an agreement.  GMO doesn't have the funds to build the mine by themselves and need a partner to help with funding/financing.  Moly is a very important component in steel alloys and other uses.

Currently trading for around $.20, this might be a good long term play if they're able to find a partner and build the mine.

Here's their website:  [http://www.generalmoly.com/](http://www.generalmoly.com/)",2019-08-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/crnrlw/my_dd_on_general_moly_gmo/
5,SNES - DD on a big move coming,cronwd,Derp2638,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cronwd/snes_dd_on_a_big_move_coming/,53,23,"SNES is a company that specializes in pest control. Currently, their only product is a new product to the market called Contrapest. This product and liquid formula in bait stations is used not as poison but as essentially rat birth control.  Itâ€™s the only product on the market that is used as this.  Itâ€™s environmentally friendly and can be used anywhere.  Also, through testing rats have shown that they prefer the Sweet taste of contrapest over the normal food in their area. The company has made clear that they want to use this formula on other animals like wild hogs and other pests. 

The Big Move- The other day the new CEO bought just shy of a million dollars worth of shares. Currently, a bill in California that might pass through this week being Ab1788 will ban all anticoagulants pesticides thus making an huge opportunity in the rodenticide  market. The governor already said he will sign the bill when it goes through the senate. And since itâ€™s in California will a lot if Democrats it has a very high chance of passing. The vote is the 19th.  I suggest you load up that morning. Good luck everyone and happy trading. Hopefully me letting you guys know this makes you guys some cash",2019-08-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cronwd/snes_dd_on_a_big_move_coming/
