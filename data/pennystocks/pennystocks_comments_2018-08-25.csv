1,dutchmanriver,e4surg2,/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/e4surg2/,1,So do you have specific parameters that you search? I’ve messed around with finviz which wasn’t bad. ,2018-08-25
2,AlligatorRaper,e4sz7zz,/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/e4sz7zz/,1,Fidelity severely limits your penny options. I’d start by switching from fidelity as your trading account. ,2018-08-25
3,aenathema,e4t3div,/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/e4t3div/,1,"I personally like their web scanners along with Active Trader Pro which is fantastic and has real-time alerts. I also haven't been limited on any OTC, penny or international securities. 

Give active trader pro a shot if you haven't, highly customizable. I have my company 401k through Fidelity as well and I can monitor it in ATP. ",2018-08-25

Thanks for the responses! ",2018-08-25

My only problem with Tradingview free is that it limits you to only 3 indicators and that's kinda a problem with EMA's and SMA's",2018-08-25

&amp;#x200B;

So r/https://finviz.com has a pretty neat screener tool (even more paramaters to add/adjust if you signup with their Elite subscription).  


If you want a really good software (also pricey) and daytrade frequently, [https://www.trade-ideas.com/](https://www.trade-ideas.com/) is fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

As for brokers:

Depending on your trading style.. If you're taking it slow and swinging (maybe basic options trading), you can use Robinhood (really it's only good for the $0 commissions).  


ToS (ThinkorSwim) is amazing.. By far one of the best, simple to use trading software. You can also get free live data if you sign the Nasdaq Level II Agreement on TD's website after creating an account without ever having to fund the account. (I did this to I can have real-time data, utilize the charting software, all the time trading for free on Robinhood).",2018-08-25
8,Cobra7fac,e4tnr2o,/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/e4tnr2o/,1,"From what I understand Fidelity is best if you have $10,000 or more. Consider looking at Robinhood as your broker. Free trades, some option trading. No minimum.

If you look into them and you want to try let me know and I'll PM an invite link so we both get a free stock.",2018-08-25

12,dutchmanriver,e4vlyx0,/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/e4vlyx0/,1,Maybe I read the info a little wrong. Sounded like they wanted a deposit. I've heard that generally TOS is the best software out there. ,2018-08-25
