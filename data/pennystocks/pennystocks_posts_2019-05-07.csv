LAS VEGAS, May 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCMKTS: ISBG) (“ISBG” or the “Company”), a top-tier brand incubator in the Adult Beverage and CBD-Infused Products markets, is proud to announce that the Caveat Emptor designation from the OTC Markets Group (the “OTC”) has been officially removed and the Company is fully current on its financial reporting.  


“We would like to thank the excellent team at the OTC for working with us diligently to correct our misunderstanding, file all necessary records, and affirm our fully current status,” commented ISBG CEO Terry Williams. “We continue to drive value for our shareholders through both our Adult Beverage and Health and Wellness divisions, and we have never been so optimistic about the Company’s growth potential as we look ahead to coming quarters. As such, it’s particularly exciting to shed the extra weight of this designation and focus 100% of our energy on maximizing returns.”

The Company has recently completed a major production run with its premium Besado Tequila brand, incorporating leading-edge Internet-of-Things and blockchain technology in the process to streamline costs and ensure the most optimal customer quality control as the product moves from raw inputs to customer end-market interactions.

In addition, the Company’s enormous strides in its Health and Wellness division continue to drive much of the growth function for its robust 2019 revenue path. The introduction of its “P19” branded line of CBD-based products continues to gain market traction, and the company plans to further build out the diversity of this offering given the quick traction established by its initial products in the marketplace.

Management also notes that the dramatic growth context now characterizing the cannabis, hemp, and CBD industries – with some analysts now calling for as much as 20x growth in the CBD space alone over the next 36 months following the signing of the US Farm Bill in December – has introduced a dangerous dynamic of “pretenders” in the marketplace, making it all the more important for ISBG to maintain its first-rate standing and credible and transparent financial data with the OTC.

“According to the analysts, every dollar invested in the CBD market right now could be worth as much as twenty times that much in a very short time,” continued Mr. Williams. “It is our responsibility to deliver that result to our shareholders. Resolving these issues with the OTC team invites institutional investors, a broader shareholder base, and greater credibility with the Company’s partners, clients, stakeholders, and customers, so we can get back to optimizing our path forward, armed with some best-in-class logistics technology to fully monetize our huge strides in topline growth.”",2019-05-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/blt4kf/isbg_caveat_emptor_removed_affirms_growth_outlook/
