1,GCGX? Thoughts?,dl10b3,ApolloMac,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl10b3/gcgx_thoughts/,2,4,"I'm somewhat surprised not to see any recent posts on GCGX here.  Last week and into today it's blown up after news was released that it got CO approval from the town.  I learned to take 99% of what I read on this sub and other places around the web with a huge grain of salt, but I'm curious what others here think about it.  Reading comments in other places, there are bulls saying it's going sky high, and bears saying to get out now it's all a scam.  The truth is, like most penny stocks, there isn't a ton of information out there to know either way.  So, are you in?  What do you think?",2019-10-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl10b3/gcgx_thoughts/

3,KULR Collaborates with NASA on High-Voltage Battery Safety Guide,dl0b74,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl0b74/kulr_collaborates_with_nasa_on_highvoltage/,2,0," CAMPBELL, Calif., Oct. 21, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**KULR Technology Group, Inc**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UiTAaPVrd9O5hb67jeWYkmIjpEnZupjcqaTShqcNSizvta8xMG1w5ctujRexNHfMoXO6Ue03xY6KruI9XVMWSNpxsxjKeAabCaZCJmfTPoU=). (OTCQB: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of battery safety and thermal management technologies, announced that it has completed first phase development for an upcoming NASA high-voltage battery safety guide.  


The NASA guide will outline the safety features of the most common commercial-off-the-shelf lithium ion battery cells as well as why and how they can fail, causing a dangerous reaction known as thermal runaway. KULR advised that internal safety devices did not adequately protect the cells from catastrophic events, specifically in cases of overcharging or in high-voltage, high-capacity configurations. KULR’s research and technical expertise in battery safety contributed to the findings in the NASA guide.

The NASA safety guide is intended to assist NASA engineers, designers and others develop and deploy energy storage and power sources for future products and missions, including NASA’s next generation space suit, which is expected to include high-capacity battery packs. NASA seeks to establish design guidelines for an advanced lithium ion spacesuit battery module that is lightweight, compact, and passively resistant to propagation or thermal runaway due to a single cell hazard.

“If there’s one place that battery failure can be catastrophic, it’s in a space suit, or in an environment where response and assistance options are limited or non-existent,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR Technology. “That’s why we’re continuing to work with NASA, and other partners where battery safety and performance are mission-critical, to understand and ultimately prevent these dangerous battery incidents.” 

This work continues and builds on KULR’s pioneering battery and thermal management collaborations with NASA. Most notably, [**KULR’s thermal runaway shield (TRS)**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lMgCUaW9Qu_X1DUt5z8wSysHw0HliFbK97fDTLzJM2vk50AreU4g1VPZJKQDe-9Cl6TbPzj8LGtt2Vkk9ZSvjVc8oqws56lMnMfogzHpoucy0v3n2nTAUcyIj6euQWWnBw7JA2QvWtwArUUfQgFtIhWpVOLE8vDuGzEoK2MHHnU=), has been shown in government and lab testing to stop or mitigate the impacts of thermal runaway in batteries.
