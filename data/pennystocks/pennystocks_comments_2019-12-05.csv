TVWS is boasted as a great NLOS solution for far distances (10-50miles) but most operators can only get out 1-3 miles.

Even if this one Broadcast company organize their spectrum usage, Rurallink will still run into noise from other broadcasters. 

Operators will not be able to meet 25Mbps without towers every few miles, making the technology unfeasible.

The key person is Mr. Fotheringham a senior executive in the industry.

 Currently Mr. Fotheringham is CEO of Ark Mediacom, Inc. which own 283 Low Power TV (LPTV) stations and TV licenses throughout the United States, covering greater than 100 million people. He is also the Executive Chairman of V-Satcast, a new satellite based IP content delivery network serving the rapidly expanding Over The Top internet video market. V-Satcast is combining the one-to-millions efficiency of satellite distribution with high capacity local storage essentially creating a massively “distributed data center” specifically targeted at rural and under-served areas of the United States. This combination of satellite and terrestrial IP broadcasting networks is adding a multicast extension to the traditionally unicast internet to bring unprecedented efficiencies in terms of performance and cost reduction to internet video delivery to the public. 

Mr. Fotheringham served as Founder, CEO and Chairman of Advanced Radio Telecom (ART), a publicly-traded, wireless Internet Service Provider and CLEC. ART held broadband radio spectrum licenses for 207 major markets in the U.S. and five countries in Europe. At ART, he was responsible for raising $225 million in the company’s NASDAQ initial public offering and subsequent public debt financings. He was also Chairman and CEO of Bazillion, a national VoIP service provider. At Bazillion, he was involved in raising $67 million to build the first national VoIP network providing toll quality voice services. Previous positions have included: President and CEO of ADAPTIX, a world leader in the development of next-generation broadband wireless system technology. ADAPTIX pioneered and secured global patent protection for the core technology of the IEEE.802.16e standard that is now embedded in Mobile WiMAX and LTE technologies. At ADAPTIX, he raised $44 million  - 2 - to fund the company post-acquisition of the Broadstorm assets.

 Beforehand, Vern served as President and CEO of Broadstorm, the pioneering OFDMA technology development company. Highlights of his career activities include direct participation in the development and international expansion of the cellular telephone industry on four continents; the creation and development of the mobile satellite and satellite audio broadcasting industry with Qualcomm, AMSC (now Ligado) and Norcom Networks (now Wireless Matrix); spearheading nationwide airto-ground communication services with AT&amp;T Mobility; winning the first GSM license in Hong Kong for SmarTone; pioneering digital satellite broadcasting as Founder of Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation; and, founding the millimetric microwave industry with the creation of both ART, as a service provider, and WaveTrace (now Harris), a pioneering point-tomultipoint microwave equipment manufacturer.

So the buyout might take longer to be resolved as well as adjusted downwards cause the market has shat the bed along with complications for opening stores in retail. 

Regardless they stiffed the shareholders. 300 million in inventories and something like 135 million in debt that’s dropping along with 44 million in outstanding shares. A 2$ buyout would have seen the buyer get an 80 million dollar discount on inventories. It gets worse though- in the buyout offer Jay Stein the founder gets to keep his shares when they go private and he owns 1/3 of that 44 million.  So now you do the math.  90 million debt + 200 million in inventories and with the offer on the table they pay 27 million for everyone’s shares. Making an 83 million dollar bargain. 

No one is saying it should have gone tit for tat with book value to buyout offer but it really feels like the shareholders got screwed on this one by a little bit. There should have been a little more meat on the bone.",2019-12-05
