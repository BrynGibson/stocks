While I agree that if you want to make real money, you have to short and long. For that you need a real broker.  With a real broker comes the advantage of OTC stocks which have a potential for more money, but are a little less predictable than NASDAQ stocks.  

The other advantage with brokers like Ustocktrade is that you can day trade all day long since it doesn't have a PDT rule in effect.  This means that you can scalp away.  

Advantages both ways.  Find one that works for you.  Personally I use four different brokers.  ",2018-01-04

169,yugo685,ds9c83f,/r/pennystocks/comments/7nziui/teum/ds9c83f/,1,I think it may hit $5 by the end of the week. For me $4 is almost a guarantee. I just wanna see it break $4 because that‚Äôs the 52 week high,2018-01-04

171,itzjamesftw,ds9lg3o,/r/pennystocks/comments/7o641c/thoughts_on_mysz_teum/ds9lg3o/,1,I don't think so. I haven't looked at it enough to have a fair opinion. Felt like it might be a pump and dump. Honestly all of these China stocks might have been. Think it's safer to just avoid for now. ,2018-01-04
172,ActuallySegall,ds9nq2j,/r/pennystocks/comments/7o2zxp/new_to_pennystocks_how_am_i_doing_so_far_how_can/ds9nq2j/,1,Agree. I think BUDZ is all hype. I've noticed it going downhill every time I peak at it. ,2018-01-04

175,AntonioEatsOreos,dscd9jw,/r/pennystocks/comments/7nzl84/how_has_your_experience_been_trading_penny_stocks/dscd9jw/,1,"TD Ameritrade's Think or swim. With penny stocks I'd assume you're going for no less than 2% gains and about 10% exiting safely, given this 5% of 2k is about 100. Sure commissions are around 10% of that but it limits your gambling and makes you more serious with each trade and the platform is insanely better even the app. + Opened up to short selling and options.

176,adam_art,dscrqtx,/r/pennystocks/comments/7o57xp/omvs/dscrqtx/,1,"Reason for the late Q, I believe, is because the new auditor has a much stricter format and standard. They switched Auditors in order to have a more prestigious firm. The company has stated many times that they plan to uplist eventually (I‚Äôm thinking my the end of 2019) and they need a legit firm to do that with. I believe that the first (initial) delay was by choice/strategy. No one switched auditors 2 weeks before a Q deadline for shits and giggles. But, I am *guessing* that the company never foresaw so many problems or discrepancies when they moved to the new auditor. Is it a huge headache? YES. But, I believe it will all be for good reason and worth it. 

We all know that OMVS was a NASTY shell **before** GP bought it. Since, he has been cleaning it up. SR would not have gotten in bed with a company that would be unsuccessful, even as a shell. 

How many OTC companies do you know with connections/partnerships to several FORTUNE 500 and 100 companies???

I‚Äôm also holding 400k shares at .09 and they‚Äôre not going anywhere! ",2018-01-04
