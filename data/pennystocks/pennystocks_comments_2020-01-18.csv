Believe what you want but good for you for looking into it. Keep doing your research open that paper trading account and give it a go. You'll never win unless you play the game. 

But just a suggestion don't discount thousands of other people's experience and advice. Penny stocks can wipe you out instantly and pump and dump scams still exist. If you're looking at them bc of ROR learn buying options. Less risky relative to the uncertainty of the underlying asset and limited losses.

Good luck",2020-01-18

I mean maybe their tech is successful and cutting edge, but often times some PhD ran startup just uses market as a piggie bank and drives stock price into the ground. Then just ch 11 and sell the patents/IP. You have to make a decision if you are looking to make money or just fund research... sorry man, I cant see many positives here at this time.

‐--‐‐------------------------

Edit: I was mistaken, looking at SEC filings now. Will edit...

Another edit: Not touching this company. Not till dilution is over with, they see at least some revenue, and the fact that administrative expenses are like 300x R&amp;D for a biotech company is alarming.


These guys are clowns:

""Our robotics system will allow doctors, and anyone permitted to treat patients, defined at the State level, such as a licensed aesthetician, to treat damaged skin autonomously by delivering micro-needling to the skin. ""

So they basically outsource the development of this autonomous device to a bunch of students U of Central Florida @$187k for a fucking microneedling device with addressable market size of jack shit. And all of company's expenses are them paying themselves paychecks. They are actually borrowing money from themselves and avoiding tax on income, while cashing in on stock.
