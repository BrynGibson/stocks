TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--Umbra Applied Technologies Group (UATG:PK) announces today that it has relocated its corporate domicile from Delaware to Florida in support of its import/export execution strategy.

Chief Executive Officer, Alex Umbra stated, “In keeping with strategic imperatives we will re-domicile the subsidiary UAT from Delaware to Florida.  This change will bolster and ameliorate our import/export apparatus so that we can continue to deliver superior products to our customers at the best possible price”.

The relocation of Umbra Applied Technologies to Florida comes on the heels of a recent change to the corporate structure of the parent company, indicating that the company intends to deliver on its stated intention to up-list to a premium market. When speaking with Chief Financial Officer Thomas Crom he emphasized, “Operating in an increasingly integrated world economy, UAT is positioning itself to better respond to both risk and opportunity while expanding on infrastructure that supports product delivery to the consumer”.  

The company continues to expand its retail footprint with the recent addition of Amazon as a retail platform.  In a recent interview Mr. Umbra stated,” In a volatile macroeconomic environment its important to remain disciplined so as to balance corporate expansion with top line growth. For example, in an M&amp;A strategy, the returns on a spreadsheet may appear appealing but the allure of immediate capital must be tempered with an executable strategy that delivers both revenue and sustainable growth. Being mindful of a structure that focuses on delivering retained earnings rather than focusing on building an impressive operating income helps to create realized growth opportunities.  Corporate governance that structures shareholder value into every decision is critical when strategically repositioning any company especially one that has had to overcome significant obstacles. The last thing you want to have happen is a critical mistake being made, that compromises investor confidence, moments before you pass the finish line. Patience is key”.

The company further indicated that it is currently reviewing multiple acquisition opportunities in furtherance of its previously stated corporate objectives to build on existing technologies and expand its stable of advanced technologies. Additionally, the company is screening multiple candidates to add to its team of highly trained professionals.  The company continues to expand its sales and distribution channels and intends to hire an additional 15 employees by the end of the year.

Initial Purchase Order Calls For 60,000 Saavy Natural Everyday Bath Bombs To Be Distributed To 3,600 Walmart Nationwide Locations   

Chatsworth, CA, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trimax Corporation, Inc. (OTC PINK: TMXN) (the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary Saavy Naturals Inc., is pleased to announce that they have just received its first purchase order from Walmart ® Corporation for the Company’s new Saavy Naturals Everyday body care line.

The initial purchase order calls for the delivery of 60,000 Saavy Naturals Everyday Bath Bombs which is planned to be distributed to 3,600 Walmart ® nationwide locations.

Saavy Naturals and their exclusive representative U.S. Merchants are currently working with Walmart ® buyers in creating unique one-of-a-kind pallet displays for Saavy Naturals Everyday Handcrafted Bulk Soaps, which are expected to go into approximately 700 stores between March and April 2018. Based on current discussions, the Company anticipates seeing consistent purchase orders from Walmart ® on a weekly basis beginning in March 2018.

As previously reported, the Company recently appointed US Merchants as their exclusive representative for the branding, marketing, packaging and distribution to Walmart® nationwide and has had several discussions and meetings with Walmart® buyers over the last several months including a face to face meeting at Walmart’s® Bentonville, AK corporate office in October 2017.

The recent purchase order received from Walmart ® is a cumulation of hard work and dedication from all parties involved, in order to address the needs of big box consumers looking for 100% all-natural alternatives for their body care needs.

Hugo Saavedra, CEO of Trimax Corporation and Saavy Naturals Inc., stated, “We would like to thank U.S Merchants and the dedicated buyers at Walmart ® for all the efforts made over the last several weeks, in order to get our new Saavy Naturals Everyday product line on to Walmart shelves. We have the utmost confidence that their loyal consumers will absolutely love the quality and price points of our new brand line, and look forward to establishing a long lasting relationship as we continue to work on getting Saavy Naturals into all Walmart ® locations.”

Hugo and Debra Saavedra, Saavy Naturals Inc.’s, CEO and President, gained instant popularity for their all-natural body care product line after being spotlighted and appearing on ABC’s hit show Shark Tank. The Sharks took an instant liking to Hugo and Debra, their love story, their previous success in the body care industry, and the superior quality of their all-natural product. Hugo and Debra have since increased the company’s product line exposure with several highlighted television features on The Home Shopping Network and are currently working on additional television marketing opportunities.

Clearly this is my first penny stock and the 40% gain for me translates into 80 bucks lol.
