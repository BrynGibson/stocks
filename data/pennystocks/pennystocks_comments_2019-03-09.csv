Also if the company is under new management, how come ihub is still showing pictures from when it was still a shell company? Leasing construction vehicles and shit was part of the previous scam. Why is It still up there if bolbat took over?

And it's a coincidence that BBDA and LEAS were tied up together via phone mukber when the pumpers on this sub happened to be pumping BBDA .


And I ask again. What does the company even do?

Investors would want to know the pipeline or catalysts or at least the intent. But if that's nowhere to be found why would people want to go long on it?

Looking at their financial statements, their revenue, income, operational expenses and growth - all are currently in negative.

I'm someone who had uterine fibroids removed by surgery. It was a benign growth and the only way to remove the growth is by surgery and also later have to manage the root cause of it - hormonal imbalance. Never once my doc suggested to use a machine (like Sonalleve) to remove fibroids. I had it in my late 20's.

"" *According to webmd.com, ‚Äúas many as 70 to 80% of all women will have fibroids by age 50.‚Äù However most women will not require treatment for this condition*. ""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what the above fact is trying to prove,  but mostly fibroids will shrink after menopause and it will not grow further and people who had menopause don't usually have to undergo surgery as it diminishes  by age. It's only those who are younger and has fibroid is susceptible to it growing and causing other issues.

Also fibroid removal surgery is done by ""Laparascopic Myomectomy""  which is non invasive in the sense that the incisions are very small and is also cost effective. I don't think anyone is going to choose it over a Sonavelle machine which will give you side effects. I'm not sure about their success rates in other countries, but in United States it is not widely used for treatment of fibroids based on my personal . I have no idea about Prostate Cancer treatments.",2019-03-09
