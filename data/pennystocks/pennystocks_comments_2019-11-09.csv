CLSI dropped an 8k with a new officer and a bunch of Q's for the first time in almost 10 years. Once it got past the $0.04 front load it was off to the races. Could have been a better run without shares held at DTC. 

SDRC I can't remember what sparked that run, getting current I think?  Their share structure at the time it started was very good. A little bit of volume and going current news would have been all it would take to set that fire 

HDII at it's current share structure needs quite a bit more volume than it's been getting lately and will need to break and hold above that $0.025-$0.03 area to have a chance at getting anywhere near $.10. It'll be tough work getting past $0.04",2019-11-09
