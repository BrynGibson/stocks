I’m a novice trader at best. I read every morning trying to establish some sort of gauge for the macro economy and searching for a window to exploit what I consider psychological or what you termed emotional trading. I’ve been inconsistent with my results for the last couple of years but I do my best to remain patient with my approach, which is itself a work in progress- a mix of market news, fundamentals on a very surface level, and technical analysis of historical price movement in response to catalysts. I find myself on the sidelines quite often watching things play out. Not sure if this is a cry for help or a rant. Nevertheless, I find your post to be insightful.",2019-09-15
