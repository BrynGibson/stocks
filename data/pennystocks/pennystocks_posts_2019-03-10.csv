&amp;#x200B;

what a week we had! $BPTH made killer moves. Made many traders rich and made many traders poor. But we only hear the winners boasting on social media about their trading success while losers are left quite.

&amp;#x200B;

But still, this is why micro and nano caps are so interesting to trade. And for those who discovered about $BPTH after the big surge here is the main points that can explain to you this price anomaly.

&amp;#x200B;

1. $BPTH is a nanocap stock (up to 50 million of market cap). Nanocaps are the real penny stocks of the stock market. When there is such an abnormal demand (volume) these nanocaps tend to fly so high due to the low supply of shares they have. You must look at shares outstanding and share float in order to get idea of what is the supply for the certain stock. On Yahoo, we can see that $BPTH there are 1.76 million shares outstanding and from which there are 526k floating shares (floating shares are shares that can be traded in the open market).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Volume was enormous for this stock the whole week. The stock saw a bit over 100 million shares traded throughout the week. So couple this with small supply (float) and you will get small supply been chased by huge demand. This is economics 101, huge demand + very small supply = price imbalances. And in this case, this was more like a price anomaly.

&amp;#x200B;

3. News are always impacting the stock price but in case of $BPTH there were no real important fundamental news excluding this article with updates about clinical trial data which wasn't very groundbreaking and not much of the importance especially to justify such price increase. But the interesting part was that there are many BS articles published about the stock and its surge. This type of content syndication can raise an eyebrow and begs the question if this was a coordinated stock price manipulation?

&amp;#x200B;

4. Google trends showed a huge increase in the search for $BPTH symbol on March 6th and 7th. This clearly showed how nicely the general public picked on the news of no importance and shifted their focus and capital to this stock. Of course, these BS articles started to appear after the article on trial data was released helping searches on google trends explode. This is the best signal to see and understand that the bag holders are lined and ready. And of course, on March 8th the stock price popped.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest is history.
