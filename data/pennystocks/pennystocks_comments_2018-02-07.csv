I don't have that big of a problem with it as there are fewer total shares out there and it is now compliant with all indexes. A lot of times with these penny stocks, they start to decrease once the RS is done. In this case however IDK, I have been high on this stock for a month or so now. They have good products and really getting ready to start pushing sales. I think that this may have been planned now to make the company look better as a whole, a $5 stock price looks a lot better then a $.14 price and it is going to start increasing. Then again this is speculation on my part and it could just as well end up down below $1 by next week.. Only time will tell.",2018-02-07

124,WeekendTacticalSuppl,du091z8,/r/pennystocks/comments/7w0ltg/nspr/du091z8/,1,"So adjusting for the RS, my purchase pps was $4.6786. At close of business, a few days after the RS today it is $5.46 and was up 8.55% on the day. Again I say an RS isn't always bad, depends on the company and reasons for the RS. So far the worst thing about this RS as of today is that I lost a 1/2 share in the split which increased my adjusted purchase pps...  

But realistically these shares I have left are after I sold and reclaimed all of my initial investment so essentially these shares I currently have cost me $0.
