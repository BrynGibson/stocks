1,Robinhood for the win!,dpz12w,Smashley0312,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dpz12w/robinhood_for_the_win/,0,10,"
I am a beginner with investing (started this year). I started with Stash initially. I would put $5 in here and there into stocks I’ve heard of or things I’ve personally used. After a few months of putting money in my stash account, I ended up with about $550 in stocks. I thought I was on my way to getting rich! 

Not so much.. I would watch my stocks go down..and down.. and yeah.. you get it!
So I’m thinking.. what am I doing anyway?! I don’t know anything about stocks..what is Nasdaq? Who is S&amp;P and 500 of what? 
I started googling and actually researching what stocks were. And yes, I know I should have done that first, but I’m not very bright. 

And here comes Robinhood for the win! 

One day I asked my dad about stocks and investing. He said “Have you heard of Robinhood?” I responded about using stash, he said “why are you only buying partial stocks? You’re never going to make money that way”

He sent me his Robinhood share link and I signed up immediately!

Coolest part to a brand new investor? I got a free stock, and so did my dad! 
And the best part about this entire post? 

You can get a free stock too!  
No money required. 
None! 
I actually can promise this from experience. 

Robinhood got me interested, and I mean truly interested in investing and stock trading. I’ve checked out so many books from the library and have spent countless hours researching stocks, and learning everything I can about investing and hopefully never having to worry about my financial future. 

Do you want a free stock? 
You could sell it, trade it, or hold it.
Maybe even start researching the company and in turn becoming an investor! 

If robinhood sounds good to you, feel free to sign up and give it a try! And I’ll enjoy a free stock from you :) 

I hope you have great success with your financial future!

SEATTLE, WA, Nov. 01, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Baristas Coffee Company, Inc. (OTCPK: BCCI) has announced that it is opening the first Virtual Restaurant which will feature Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream and Baristas coffee products along with other snacks delivered to homes and businesses. The Virtual Restaurant will initially be available to customers in select regions near Seattle and is expected to expand once scalable processes are established and tested.   


Baristas’ Virtual Restaurant “Munchie Magic” allows national unified branding without the need for physical locations. All menu items are for delivery only and will be fulfilled by partner distribution locations and delivered by its delivery partners. The program is scheduled to begin rolling out November 8th 2019 initially in the Seattle, WA area, focusing on the “couch moments” when consumers most order desserts and the “craving coffee” periods. The initial launch will help refine the processes and allow for the restaurant to expand into other regions quickly. 

Barry Henthorn, CEO, stated: “By opening the first Virtual Restaurant location literally in our own backyard we will be able to closely monitor and refine our policies and procedures and adopt quickly to what we learn. We feel that pairing Baristas products with Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream will hit the sweet spot of our target market and we are very excited about expanding very rapidly to other regions.”

Coffee is the number one beverage consumed in America and ice cream is the top ordered dessert 55% followed by brownies at a distant 28%. The two have long been a favorite pairing. Ben &amp; Jerry’s is the No.1 super-premium brand in the US and Baristas Coffee is the No.1 brand for white coffee. 86% of consumers in the US utilize home delivery at least once per month and cite convenience as the No.1 factor.

ReelTime Media recently announced that ReelTime Media (OTCPK: RLTR) has become the exclusive marketing agency of record and production partner for the Baristas Coffee (OTCPK: BCCI) / Ben &amp; Jerry’s partnership agreement with Unilever www.unilever.com and Ice Cream Now developing and implementing a network to deliver Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and Baristas Coffee products to homes and businesses throughout America. To clarify and avoid confusion, ReelTime Media’s exclusive marketing agency of record specifically refers to marketing ordered by Baristas for the purpose of supporting the marketing of the ""Munchie Magic"" Virtual Restaurant that focuses on home delivery of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream, Baristas Coffee, and other late-night food items. For further clarification, as the ""production partner"" of the project, as announced, ReelTime Media will handle all aspects of creative and production of a multimedia campaign (specific to this project) that is expected to include advertisements and promotions on TV, radio, print, social media, out of home, and new digital media. In no way shall ReelTime be involved in nor responsible for the ""production"" of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream nor does the agreement contract ReelTime to produce any Ben &amp; Jerry's specific advertisements nor marketing materials.",2019-11-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dq67km/bcci_rltr_baristas_features_partner_ben_jerrys_in/
