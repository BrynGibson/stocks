[https://imgur.com/gallery/ULgahQd](https://imgur.com/gallery/ULgahQd) (Trump pumps Workhorse on twitter)

As some of you may remember, the President announced that Workhorse was in talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown complex. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that this is, in my opinion(opinion), impossible, and I‚Äôll show you why.

WKHS is in the middle of a Death Spiral Financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of [Karl-Heinz Kipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa [department store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store) chain. [His sisters wedding was attended by the likes of Prince Harry, Prince William, and numerous other prominent royals.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9904867/Duke-and-Duchess-celebrate-friends-wedding-in-Swiss-Alps.html)

At first, it wasn‚Äôt readily apparent who Till Bechtolsheimer was. When he participated in the GP of Monaco racing event, there was an article written about him that pretended he was [some mystery man.](https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2017/03/16/cjwrs-renaissance-man-till-bechtolsheimer-reflects-on-first-ctsc-year/)

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find out who he was because in 2014, his girlfriend (I‚Äôm guessing ex girlfriend now) was party to an altercation where it is claimed she[ smashed a beer bottle over the back of a mans head](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509010704/https:/www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-defend-friend-of-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-accused-of-beer-bottle-attack-in-club-9138649.html) for daring to bump into her royal boyfriend at a nightclub. It gets even better. Apparently she was the former vice president of HSBC‚Äôs derivatives and structured products arm in New York. What a coincidence. Derivatives and ‚Äústructured products‚Äù are perfect for people who want to invest, but don‚Äôt want to actually own the underlying asset.Insiders and beneficial owners don‚Äôt have to report option activity or swap contract agreements with 3rd parties chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/[http://www.thomsonstockreports.com/pdf/E.pdf](http://www.thomsonstockreports.com/pdf/E.pdf) , which is perfect for royals and people of their stature who hide all their money in [trusts in the City of London.](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/tax-avoidance-paul-collier-david-cameron-g8)

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it?

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) S-3 12/26/18

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g)

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 4 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal don't you think?

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [‚Äúbust out‚Äù ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon).

[https://imgur.com/U49I51k](https://imgur.com/U49I51k)

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [Surefly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential.

[https://imgur.com/LFngngO](https://imgur.com/LFngngO)

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by.

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF)

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly..

[https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4](https://imgur.com/u3DKNn4)

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing????!!! This is insanity! He is supposed to be the president of the United States, supposedly the greatest military strength in world history, the Commander-In-Chief, and he is pumping this POS.....

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is explicitly for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, and in 2018 sales were $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though. If you do the math, 2018 expenses were 3000% of net sales!!! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!!

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy. [Also, the founder recently left, someone who had been with the company for almost a decade!](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/05/1711059/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Promotes-President-and-Chief-Operating-Officer-Duane-Hughes-to-Chief-Executive-Officer.html)

The only time I encounter this message is when I‚Äôm using a public wifi‚Ä¶In my entire life, I think I can count on one hand how many times I have seen this message on my home connection‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

I must excuse myself for all the expletives and caps, and I know it may seem like I'm engaging in hyperbole, but look at this! This is a disgrace. An insult to not just our intelligence, but to our capital markets. The supposed Commander-In-Chief of the Free World pumping penny stocks in the middle of death spiral financing, facing bankruptcy, with almost 20 million registered warrants owned by de facto royalty.....All you can do is just take a deep breath and shake your head in stunned exasperation at this point. I don't recommend buying this, that's for sure, not now anyways. You let me down with this one Trump.

4,Pump and Dump for Friday 5/24,bql8lr,Richard_Jackson,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bql8lr/pump_and_dump_for_friday_524/,0,8," This is my first time on Reddit so forgive me for any mistakes, anyway I am targeting ENZN(Enzon Pharamceutacles) for price manipulation this next coming Friday. I stumbled across this Reddit a couple of days ago and I thought I might try a little experiment. I have been manipulating penny stocks for a couple of years in my free time. I figured that some of the members of this Reddit might want to participate in a pump and dump(minus the fake news). If any of you are interested, here's how it would work: I would set a price target like 1$ and on Friday at the opening bell we would all aggressively bid up the stock. When the price reaches our target then the hope is that the increased price and volume might attract speculative investors that we can unload our shares on. In the past, I have tried many different methods of manipulation and I have had the greatest success with buying a large chunk of shares at a discounted price, then I use a relatively small amount of cash to fulfill the inflated sell orders of the stock, this drives up the price and I have found that speculators tend to get caught up in a sharply rising stock. I then unload my overpriced shares on speculators that think the price will keep rising. Anyway, the process would work a lot better and be a lot more profitable if multiple people would help me bid up the price.
