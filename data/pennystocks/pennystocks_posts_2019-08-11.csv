I kept looking at different stocks across the sector yesterday and one thing was evident. Something happened across the sector in the last 20 minutes of trading Friday and CTST benefited greatly because of it. What caused CTST to shoot up 40%, Auxly, Fire, Supreme, Vivo and Canopy Rivers to drop by 10-15%? ETF rebalancing was responsible. While others likely just jumped in the stock on top of the large move by the ETF for CTST, the large position change by the ETF‚Äôs ‚Äúrobots‚Äù are what initiated the run. I think this is extremely unfair that an ETF at anytime should have the power to move a stock like this, that‚Äôs why they use terms such as balancing, distribution, fair exposure and are labeled more conservative. They should have to answer to the SEC about what happened on Friday. The attached article touches on what happened. The ETF is already doing damage control as this article is being removed from a large amount of trading apps and being suppressed by Google as of Sunday afternoon. Oh, and CTST without news will likely sink like a rock next week, like a pump and dump.
