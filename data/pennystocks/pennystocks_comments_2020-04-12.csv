There's more than one way to play this.

I will almost certainly have a stake when news comes. Maybe not all of it, it just depends on the price before the news. If I have a chance to sell half, get my investment out with 50% profit and still have half to go long, I probably will.

It's the best of both worlds and protects me from losses.",2020-04-12

If it's running hard and goes right through $1.48, I'll follow it up with a stop-loss for the first half instead of selling but I'll get my investment and profit out before close in case the news is bad.

However, there are warrants at .75, .90, and 1.00. If those are exercised and they sell, we could see a run and then a drop. If I see a major drop above $1.20, I may swing it all.

This is a complicated play for me. I don't have an exact answer.

In the end, if the news is good, I want to have a long term stake and my investment back, with profit in hand.",2020-04-12

The problem is they have no income. AG013 is being funded by investors/dilution and is expected to generate the income they need to bring the rest of their drugs through trials and to market.

If this fails, they will have to reverse split and dilute and/or find new investors. It's all bad news if they don't have good results.

There's always a reason a stock with this much potential is this low and that's the reason. It's do or die.
