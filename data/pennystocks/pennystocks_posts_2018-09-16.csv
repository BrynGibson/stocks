2,$CFGX – Capital Financial Global,9gcixc,PlanetaOTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9gcixc/cfgx_capital_financial_global/,10,9,"Hello guys

Any opinions about $CFGX? Seems like one of the best triple zero stocks out there. Only 2B float and 2.85B AS.

They just were reinstated with NVSOS and uploaded all pending filings.

Thin ask without dilutors.

It ran very well in the past: 15 bagger in early 2014 and 7 bagger in summer 2014.
