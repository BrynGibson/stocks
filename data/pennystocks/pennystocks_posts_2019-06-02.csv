Could be anything. What do you have on watch. What is your plan. What did you do in the weekend to decompress. Tell it here traders🔥

I had a week which started great, but friday came around and got a little burned on major trend reversals. Did some studying, made a kickass yt vid, and went to the beach today to have a nice lunch and drink and decompress with the sunshine on my face😎. I must say i overtraded a bit but upcoming week i want to hone in on my exits more. Let me know everyone🤙🏻 hope the week and weekend was great for you",2019-06-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bvyubz/everyone_ready_for_the_upcoming_week/
