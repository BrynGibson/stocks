 I am familiar with the social media route to engaging investors, along with being active on smaller chat boards or paid advertising.

 \-They only reported a 200k quarterly profit! Not that big of a deal! 

 \-So why did it go up so much??[Take a look at their most recent 13-D](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/29/3499/). 69% of the float is controlled by 2 people! 

\- If you do the math, there are only 2.4 million shares available in the secondary markets, and if you look at the chart, it looks like somebody already purchased a large block of that!! 

 Conclusion, bullish in the short term, like the next few days, but long term I’d be very wary! Honestly we have no idea what is going to happen because the share count is so low, but it can't keep going up forever, and as of now, if you price the shares at $8.00, ELTK’s market cap is $43 200 000, which would give it an implied forward P/E ratio of 43! Also, the 70% shareholder is up almost 800%!!!! Be careful, that’s all we are saying!! Good luck and godspeed!!! Until the next time everyone!

Seems like for a pink sheet stock there is quite a bit of news regularly on this company which from what I've noticed is an exception.

They seem like a low risk, high reward if it pans out. Just curious what you folks feel about this stocks future earning potential is.  The chart tells me it's potential for gains is unlikely however it seems for an otc the transparency is decent.

You at a buy,sell, or hold yourselves?
I'm invested in long term and possibly increasing position in the future if my personal DD tells me it would make sense.

The Company is pleased to announce the launch of its SwiftCoin digital wallet, which both are now live for download in both the Android and iOS platforms.   


Download the SwiftCoin wallet by visiting [http://www.swiftcrypto.io](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1vinDbRWDEkHUrH4nP4qQ6ZFzWUmpV40qqDIN455d37jxEGT7qND72CsCIPHQJXczzEl9m2SBXvICzF60lEEnVL0mAfkDcOftQpvJufLHNA=)   


**SwiftCoin**

\- De-mystifies the process of storing digital currency.

\- Provides an easy-to-use digital wallet with guided instructions on setup and configuration.

\- Uses paper key backup which is more secure as no data is stored online.

\- Currently, you can store, send and receive both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the wallet.  


**Partnerships**  


SwiftCoin is an easy to use and secure crypto wallet that lets you store, send, and receive Bitcoins and Ethereum. One of the plans going forward is to build partnerships and joint ventures to expand the use and functionality of the SwiftCoin wallet with our future partners in need of a crypto storage and transfer platform.  


**Integration**  


We will also be working to integrate our SwiftCoin wallet into a number of working platforms, such as our own delivery tracking platform for cannabis companies, and VoIP telecom system. We will also explore use of API integration for developers looking to build web based and mobile applications around the technology, or as an add-on feature to enhance their own product functionality.   


Ron Brewer, the CEO of AppSwarm, commented, “With the renewed interest in Bitcoin and blockchain back in the forefront we feel this launch to be very timely, and we will work on building partnerships and integration around our technology through the summer as we work to build out our digital projects division.”
