34,3103MGunner,fkk3nck,/r/pennystocks/comments/fiy3ub/opko_cv19_fda_faq/fkk3nck/,1,"More Opinions found on Yahoo Finance. Don‚Äôt hold me accountable and do your own assessment. 

1. ""We have enormous numbers of requests from hospitals, health systems and physicians, and we will send out a notice to physicians and clients with instructions about what they need to do to order the test,"" Cohen told the Business Journal.

There is a limited number of U.S. labs that can test for the novel coronavirus because labs must first apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval, and then they must receive materials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to run the testing accurately.
BioReference on Friday also announced a partnership with the New York State Department of Health on a drive-through testing facility in New Rochelle, the city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in New York. BioReference expects to offer up to 5,000 test a day there, with satellite locations to come later.
he company has labs in New Jersey, Texas and Melbourne.

2. Looking at this stock from a charting point of view, there is near term resistance at $2.87 and $3.90, but in my opinion, the real question is whether price can break out of the down trend shown in blue lines on the chart. Right now that level is a touch about $4.60.

If it does that, it could get legs. There are major resistance lines at $6.40 and $12.15. Above that I see a tough level at $19.20, the all time high.

Having said all that, if it breaks the downtrend line, my targets would be about $6.40 and $9.00. I‚Äôll reassess if it gets to $9.00, which seems unlikely but you never know.

For this narrative the chart is on imgur at https://i.imgur.com/x4hemaX.gif .

3. What does this testing mean for revenue? The NY deal gets them 5,000 test a day, 35,000 a week, 150,000 a month and ~500K per quarter. At $50/test that's $2.5M for the quarter in revenue for just the NY contract. How many more contracts will BRL get? 10, 20, 50? 

There are ~330,000,000. If 10% get tested and BRL get's 10% of the test that's 3,300,000 test, or $165M.

Testing is only a minor reason to buy OPKO, The 4K Score, Rayaldee, and hGH-CPT revenue will be a factor of 100 larger than virus testing. What the testing WILL do is turn OPKO cash flow positive, guaranteeing they will be able to realize the coming mile stone payments and revenue, AND not require additional funding. Simply put, NO MORE DILUITION.

4. PRESIDENT to set up BRLI, COV-19 test labs all over the country not just in New York: Durng his State of Emergency while speaking during an afternoon Rose Garden event, Trump gathered American retail executives to announce they were donating resources to institute drive-through testing at locations across the country, collected on a new online portal that will be available on Sunday evening.
He said he was allowing his health secretary to waive certain regulations to provide more flexibility to doctors and hospitals responding to the outbreak.

5. Quote from yesterday's CNBC interview with Cohen:
""We serve all 50 states so we have the logistics to pick up pretty much everywhere in the country""

Just something to ponder.

The duration how long it‚Äôs gonna take and last. 

Everything so far about OPK is positive. Korea is currently exercising the drive through model, which about 90% of the tests are done this way. 

Key to note from my personal experience at this very moment for how to conquer this virus as a nation, at least it‚Äôs what I think how it‚Äôs should be done! My family went back to China celebrate Chinese New Year last year December. We all know it stated trending in Jan 2020. China officially locked down all cities , counties , villiages. Some of them even destroying roads. If people don‚Äôt know you , you ain‚Äôt coming into their Neighbour hood . You don‚Äôt have local license , people ain‚Äôt letting you in the city. You from WuHan ? Bro you are fucked, nobody want to be near you and they will call the cops on you . A special forces unit from the Umbrella will come scoop your ass up and put you on lock down for 14 to 21 days. Check points after check points. Idk that‚Äôs prob just the art of communism tho. The people do what the government told. That how most of them are opening stores and able to conquer the virus expand. 

Sorry if drift away , key timeline to point out. Under Chinese government model which no one is out in the street. It‚Äôs take from 1st of Jan to 10th of March for my wife city to be reopened. They had 20 confirmed cases and some possibles. So over all about 10 weeks under Chinese model.

I tried to snake the chain with all the company's he mentioned because most of them the calls were down and it happened so fast the chain makers could not raise prices fast enough!!!
  In my opinion why load up on lots of shares when you could buy option spreads at a very reasonable price and have such potential of high gains and you know what you loss is. I have 30 contracts in tlt I sold 1 that i paid ..05($5) for and sold for 22,400% gains or $1250 in less than a week, sure wish I bought more contracts on that cause it was a naked call, but I am also happy doing debit spreads with $5 or so between strike prices, n take $500... But the key with options is watch tutorials and read about the basics it took me over 5 months of utube University and investopedia to feel like I understand them a little and the $3 Yolo plays are a true shot in the dark!!!

News about OPK being linked to government contracts started breaking Thursday.  Friday morning the prices climbed pre market.  The news of the government contracts started hitting news feeds pre market.  Jon Cohen appeared with Gov. Cuomo on national TV.  And even after all that the price still sank like a stone.  I ended up getting out of my position with a tiny profit as the price came back down.  Major disappointment.  The reality is that this stock has a 400 million share float.  It isn't going to move like people want.  Also these coronavirus plays aren't strong enough.  Everyone is viewing them as pump and dumps even when the news is very good and will increase revenue for the company.  My rule right now is to just avoid the coronavirus plays.,2020-03-15

Shares can be bought currently around $23 but shareholders believe that if Sector 10 wins the trial that 1 share of SECI will be worth approximately $3,275 because only 306,000 shares exist because they were forced to do 3 reverse stock splits to fend off off price manipulation from the Billionaires and there friends to try and drive Sector 10 out of business.  You can review most of the evidence and Due Diligence information at InvestorsHub.com if you type in SECI in the search bar and find there message board.  Be aware there are about 5 paid bashers currently working the board trying to scare people into selling there stock. Ironically a level 3 paid basher names Tenkay just showed up 2 weeks ago which many people say is a very good thing for the stock once one of these highest level paid bashers shows up.  Best of luck to you.  This one will be either a massive profit or a complete loss if they lose.  All of my DD shows that I believe the CEO invented the technology and that it in fact was stolen. They just now need to win at the trial and the stock should sky rocket if they do in-fact win.  Again do your own research as a lot is at stake with this as the CEO has stated around 200 companies and individuals are illegally using and sharing his technology without Sector 10‚Äôs permission. Also the last trade shows as $11.50 because the price only updates if blocks of 100 sell at once. The volume is very low on this stock due to the micro float of 306,000 but if you go to buy most shares are being picked up around the mid $20s.

New York 729 POSITIVE!!! Imagine unconfirmed

Individuals with symptoms who may have traveled to areas of concern or have been in contact with somebody who has traveled to these areas should call ahead to their health care provider before seeking treatment in person.
Health care providers determine whether a test should be done. Patients must meet the state‚Äôs criteria to be tested, which evaluates a combination of symptoms and risk factors.
New York state had 28 public and private labs conducting testing, as of March 13.
The state‚Äôs public health lab can complete a test in three to five hours.
For more information, call 1-888-364-3065 or visit the New York Department of Health‚Äôs website.
