5,ReHashing Discussion on $RIBT,8vjdrc,no__way__jose,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8vjdrc/rehashing_discussion_on_ribt/,5,8,"Last year I posted the following regarding RIBT. I made my first purchase sub 1.00. They've since made pretty big strides in getting back to a positive EPS. The post I made last year was as follows:

===========

**""Company has regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Accordingly, RBT is in compliance with all applicable listing standards and its common stock and warrants will continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ considers the matter closed.""**

**Truthfully, I don't know many reasons a company would do this unless they really felt like they wanted to at least appear to be turning it around. Even if they aren't, they might continue to drive their share price up a bit until we know more.**

**-Sold an 18 million dollar subsidiary. Paid off their 12 million in debt. Using some of remainder to start moving forward with other business.** [**https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/391-ricebran-technologies-sells-healthy-natural-subsidiary-for-18-3-million-in-order-to-focus-on-building-shareholder-value-through-its-ingredient-business**](https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/391-ricebran-technologies-sells-healthy-natural-subsidiary-for-18-3-million-in-order-to-focus-on-building-shareholder-value-through-its-ingredient-business)

**-Back in May 17 someone renewed a contract for them to supply ingredients for manufacturing. They are definitely doing some sort of business still and I believe the new positions they've filled are to drive similar contracts and revenue.**

**-A private grain company called ""Continental Grain Company"" purchased 16\% stake in RiceBran a few weeks back. Although it's possibly fluff, they're apparently one of the oldest grain trading companies in the world.** [**https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/399-continental-grain-company-acquires-a-16-equity-interest-in-ricebran-technologies**](https://www.ricebrantech.com/news-room/press-releases/399-continental-grain-company-acquires-a-16-equity-interest-in-ricebran-technologies)

**If a 200 year old grain trading investment company believes RIBT might be positioned correctly in the market, there might be some money to be made.**

**-Unless I am reading it incorrectly, their numbers seem to be turning around over the last 3 years(the ones listed on Yahoo finance.)**

**-RiceBran itself. It has high popularity in ASIAPAC currently and could potentially spread, whether as a fad or legit industry.** 

**High risk, high reward. I'm still new at a lot of this stuff and it's always a gamble. Just finding a possible diamond in the rough company myself without someone telling me to invest is alone worth the risk. If anyone can apply some actual knowledge towards the information available from this company I would definitely be interested to hear your thoughts.**

==================

Their two latest moves have been getting brought into the Russel MicroCap Index and then the FDA accepting a petition to add ricebran(their product market) into the FDA's list of approved dietary fibers. With health and food being a massive market, I can only hope that ricebran taking off would mean RIBT is well positioned.",2018-07-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8vjdrc/rehashing_discussion_on_ribt/
