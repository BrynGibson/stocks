4,supernova2020,f307l7l,/r/pennystocks/comments/dezs8h/kulr_technology_to_showcase_spaceutilized/f307l7l/,1,"No doubt the lack of volume/liquidity is a great risk that must be considered so your opinion is warranted.  However, I do not believe this press release is at all meaningless. The following is a decent article written about the risk/rewards of trading low volume stocks:  [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/rewards-trading-stocks-low-volume.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/rewards-trading-stocks-low-volume.asp)  

That said, the lack of volume for KULR stems primarily from 2 factors (in my humble opinion). The first being that KULR is a developmental stage company and arguably overvalued at $161M (today's valuation) with little revenue. The second being that KULR as an OTC stock isn't being actively ""promoted"" or manipulated like many other OTC stocks.  In due time, I believe that as the Company proves itself and the market becomes aware of the commercial potential of Company's technology, volume will increase. 

To date, the Company has been ""self-financed"" having raised over $6 million through family members, friends, and associates of KULR management. 

In my opinion, the biggest question of concern is whether or not KULR can effectively commercialize it's still somewhat abstract (yet superior) technology (carbon fiber based thermal management products) in a meaningful way and displace traditionally used forms of thermal management (i.e. aluminum and copper heat sinks, thermal pads, etc). In other words, will markets adopt KULR's technologies in consideration of cost, efficacy, and ease of designing into their platforms/devices. If KULR is unable of doing so then no doubt, the stock is overvalued and the lack of volume will continue to be a concern. 

Before passing judgement on KULR, perform the necessary due diligence on the Company as well as the physical science behind carbon fiber as a light-weight, pliable thermally conductive material.  Also, as mentioned, be aware of the risks associated with investing OTC stocks and low volume stocks. 

 \*\*About KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG)\*\*KULR Technology Group, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary KULR Technology Corporation (""KTC""), develops and commercializes high-performance space-used thermal management technologies for electronics, batteries, and other components across an array of applications such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving (collectively as E-Mobility), AI/Cloud computing, energy storage, and 5G communication technologies.  KULR's proprietary, core technology is a carbon fiber material with roots in aerospace and defense that provides superior thermal conductivity and heat dissipation in an ultra-lightweight and pliable material.  By leveraging this break-through cooling solution and its longstanding development partnerships with NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab and others, KULR makes E-Mobility and other products cooler, lighter, and safer. **https://www.kulrtechnology.com**

\*\*Disclosure:\*\*This information does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of offers to buy any securities of any entity. My family has invested in KULR and I am personally acting as a consultant for KULR and have been compensated in shares for that role. I have done extensive research on the Company and personally believe it has exceptional thermal management technology, management team, and real potential to displace conventional thermal management solutions in the marketplace. That said, I am not a licensed financial professional and do not recommend you buy or sell KULR. There is obviously risk of loss when buying or selling securities and generally even greater risk associated with buying or selling micro-cap stocks. Some real challenges faced by micro-cap companies include raising capital, increasing liquidity, attracting institutional investors, gaining analyst coverage, and general mistrust of the micro-cap market. Micro-cap companies also tend to lack in resources and often struggle to commercialize their products or services in a meaningful way.",2019-10-08

Obviously this doesn't translate to the short term as there are a lot more factors that play into that, so for day and swing traders this isn't the ideal type of stock to trade.
