Now that Baristas and its EnrichaRoast coffee have committed to reaching the NASCAR fans, ReelTime Media is exploring additional opportunities within NASCAR broadcasts and with various race teams.   


The publication, officially licensed by NASCAR, is a collectable annual publication that offers both a look back at the 2018 season and a preview of the year ahead. Packed with in-depth features on the drivers and the teams that dominate the headlines. Baristas will be featured in a full-page color introduction to the Baristas EnrichaRoast coffee and given a special race code for discounts.   


Baristas was recently featured in Forbes.com for its ads at the Super Bowl that ReelTime Media facilitated.

# TOKERS &amp; JOKERS | CANNABIS STOCKS ON THE RISE

&amp;#x200B;

US and Canadian cannabis stocks rebounded Thursday, bouncing back from yesterday‚Äôs turbulence.

Tuesday trading was halted for **Green Growth Brands (OTCMKTS: GGBXF) (CSE: GGB)** and **Aphria Inc (NYSE: APHA)** after Green Growth made a formal takeover bid to acquire Aphria. If executed, the bid will be the largest cross-border takeover in the cannabis industry to date. Which brings into question how shareholders will react if Aphria is removed from the New York Stock Exchange. The CA$2.8B all-stock bid has been seen as an unenthusiastic offer that undervalues Aphria‚Äôs position. Purpose Investments‚Äô portfolio manager Greg Taylor told Bloomberg that he doesn‚Äôt see a scenario where Aphria isn‚Äôt bought out. Aphria urged shareholders to take no action until its Board issues formal recommendations.

Green Growth closed down 0.68% on the OTC at $4.34.

CIBC analyst John Zamparo recently initiated coverage on Aphria, Cronos, and Canopy Growth.
