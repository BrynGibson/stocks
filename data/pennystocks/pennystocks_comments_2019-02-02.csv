You get your money (maybe plus a little) and can keep the rest in case of moon one day. It's essentially like acquiring free stocks. You just need to be patient.

When the market comes crashing down gold will surge and it will increase demand and therefore increase revenue of these corporations. Mineral sector is not hyped up and there is something physical behind it not empty promises. TRQ has a big project in Mongolia a copper-gold deposit that is said to be sustainable for at least 50 years and it will grow the third largest copper deposit in the world by 2025. Of course they hype it up for the future but let me tell you Chinese institutions are buying Canadian minerals left and right. Institutional ownership of TRQ is 39%. But don't buy because I said so. This is not financial advice and you have DD (due diligence) .  Look it up it's certainly not a bubble and benefits if gold rises. For example GORO was @40usd in 2011-12 and TRQ 26 CAD .

Im on the fence.... Part of me (The reckless side of me) wants to YOLO this shit and fingers cross this bitch into the target price of $2.50. The other part that is learning about the fundamentals/technical side of trading on the stock market - that side is screaming pump the breaks and watch this shit a while longer. So far they don't really have anything to brag about, much less anything proprietary. Nothing is stopping Monster/Rockstar/ Toss a dart at a random name drink company , from copying/competing.    


IF Hemp based energy drinks become a ""Thing"" Monster/Rockstar etc... they have way more established logistics and distribution channels. It would take no time at all for them to put their own brand on the shelves of 100,000+ stores in what would feel like no time flat. ",2019-02-02
