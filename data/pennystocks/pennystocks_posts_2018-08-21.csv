**The bears are skeptical about the convertible debt that the company incurred, as well as less attractive financing deals.**  J Capital Research asserts that the financing deals have benefited a select group of investors who are close to the CEO. ",2018-08-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/98z88z/whats_the_sentiment_now/

**NASHVILLE, TN / ACCESSWIRE / August 21, 2018 /** The Cartwright Concealed Carry Coat by American Rebel is featured in the third installment of a five-part series in the NRA Publication *America's 1st* *Freedom* on how to pick the right handgun to carry for defensive purposes. Author Frank Jardim details his choice of the Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special Model 10 K-Frame 4-inch revolver as one of his top four choices when he arms himself. A K-Frame Revolver offers good protection when clothing, weather and venue permit the carrying of a larger handgun. In the colder months when he's working outside, Frank carries this revolver completely concealed in the built-in pocket of his American Rebel brand Cartwright work coat. ""It looks and wears like a heavy-canvas, high-quality Carhartt coat,"" Frank says, ""but the flannel lining has a Velcro® and snap secured gun pocket on each side that blends in to the point that I can work with the coat unzipped and nobody would ever guess I have a full-size handgun on me. Despite the deep concealment, the gun is quite quick to deploy if using both hands. Drawing with one hand is a naturally slower two-step process, first pulling open the pocket and then grabbing the gun grip.""

They have won cyber security excellence awards for 2018 in data classification, data governance and GDPR compliance. 

Data443 is also growing in size of the team; hiring new professionals.

We are going to see more cyber security protocols and guidelines rolled out in the US soon with the FB (and others) issues coming to light. 

I see Data443 as a very undervalued company and am using these little dips to expand my position. In the long run I see this stock going up and past the OTC market.
