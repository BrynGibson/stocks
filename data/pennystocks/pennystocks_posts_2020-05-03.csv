0,MVIS reverse split.,gcm9au,27ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcm9au/mvis_reverse_split/,1,5,The only reason they would do a reverse split is to comply with NASDAQ's $1/Share requirement.

1,A CYDY filing that has gone unnoticed,gcm44l,DilanthaDD94,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcm44l/a_cydy_filing_that_has_gone_unnoticed/,1,5,"Hello all,

There has been a lot of hype about CYDY in the last couple of months. No surprise because the company has made some actual progress in developing a cure for Covid-19. Shares are up 220% since the beginning of the year, and on April 30, CYDY announced some good results in its trials. 

But, the CEO has sold more than 4 million shares on April 30. A normal Edgar search won't show you that because this was filed in a Form-144. I think most of the positive news is already factored in now. It would take the company commercializing a product to trigger another bull run as far as I see.

26,How to do a DD for beginners.,gcren7,realaxing,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcren7/how_to_do_a_dd_for_beginners/,1,51,"Trading stocks, you have to operate on some core principles, otherwise you'll be sloppy and you'll lose money everywhere with your only gains being on mistake. A good core ideal to have is that the market knows everything you know, and has calculated these things into it's price already.

Now sometimes, there's some niche information out there and only the big boys at the top who take the %10 of winning trades know. That's called alpha. Alpha is anything that the market price hasn't yet accounted for. Now, this is hard to find and usually, can only be found in person, through physically investigative means or from some drop box link that you really weren't supposed to find. Getting actual, solid alpha is incredibly profitable because you know something is going down and can bet on it months in advance; but as profitable as it is, it's rare. 

So what can \*you\* do? You can still do your due diligence and at least trade with the same level of knowledge the market moves at and make your own determinations of it based on your interpretation of the data. A good place to start is with the company's 10-k and 10-k/a filings. The 10-k gives you an overview of every single Asset, Liability, Risk, and Executive within a company, with the 10-k/a giving an overview of the executive structure. These two forms, although boring as all hell, contain a plethora of knowledge crucial to making a smart move on the market. You can find these by googling (stock symbol) ""sec filings""

Internet forums, online trading gurus, and people who have a dad working at dronetendo aren't people to listen to for trading ideas. Make your own trading ideas. Don't get swept up in someone's pump-and-dump model. Have a good idea, find a stock you like to fit that idea, do your homework, and invest. That's how the market makes money. Hold onto an investment for a month to three months, and take out substantially more stable, viable earnings.",2020-05-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcren7/how_to_do_a_dd_for_beginners/

Here are some scientific facts:
UV Light:
UV light can be categorized into A, B or C. With UV-C being the highest energy (shorter wavelength) and UV-A being the lowest energy (longest wave length). UV causes damage to cells because DNA absorbs the photons that cause DNA mutation called Thymine Dimers. This DNA damage leads to an inability to express genes or a over expression; the point being cells don‚Äôt function correctly and or in some cases become cancerous. BUT, certain narrow wavelengths of UV function as therapeutics, for say psoriasis as an examlple. While the mechanism isn‚Äôt completely understood (as are many things in science medicine), it effectively destroys those cells affected by psoriasis while preserving normals cells and not causing off target mutations. 

Theory behind UV-A in Healight: 
If I were to use my background in science I would hypothesize that a very narrow band of UV-A light has been shown to destroy bacterial and viral cells while not harming mammalian cells. Mammalian cells are enormous in comparison to viruses, the are protected by think cell walls, their interiors are filled with organelles(Golgi mitochondria etc.) and its nucleus is covered in an additional protective membrane. The Coronavirus in comparison are less complex, a simple lipid bilayer  and nuclear capsid protect the single stranded RNA (if my memory serves me right). It is then feasible that UV-A will effect the smaller viral cells to a much larger extent than mammalian cells. 
Let me guarantee that no medical doctor or translational research scientist would ever claim a technology worked without substantial scientific evidence to back it up. We as the general public are not privy to their experimental data until it gets peer-reviewed, meaning non-partial scientist closely scrutinize your protocol and every piece of data before giving it the ok. From a science stand point there is nothing that tells me this technology is bogus or not feasible. In my opinion it has potential and am going to hold until I see the literature or hear from the FDA

In today‚Äôs age of technology information is passed around the world in a matter of seconds. An easy strategy for penny stocks is to scour through several different platforms looking for the same stock to be talked about across all the platforms. If a stock is being hyped up on all different platforms it is likely to rise, at least temporarily, simply due to the hype it has online. The key with this is to be sure you get out of the stock extremely quick and never become a bag holder based simply off of random internet users opinion and hype. 

I know this is probably a very unpopular opinion in the stock world because it‚Äôs well known that you should do you own DD before investing but in terms of making a **quick profit on penny stocks** this strategy could actually be useful. The internet has enough small time traders that it can pump a stock if it is talked about enough online. So far I have gotten in and got out with large profits on $AYTU $UAVS and I am currently in $MVIS at .379 because of the early hype I saw on social media.

I figure that with the 30+ day lock down that NY and other states have faced, there are a lot of miss parties and celebrations that people have been aching to get into. To me, that means Party City (PRTY).

Now the second reason that PRTY is a hot stock for me is, and this is stupid but try, PRTY is a cool stock symbol and those seem to bring the investors at strange times. I know it's stupid but that's just what it is. Once people can PRTY again this summer, those investors will be pushing the price.

Lastly, there is this link that just came out today:

50,BBRW DD,gcug5a,siioo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcug5a/bbrw_dd/,1,35,"Hi all, as mentioned in [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gay6cw/filling_dd_requests/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I will be doing some DD requests. For my first one, here is my take on BBRW.

**Disclaimers: I am not a finance professional. I am not making any recommendations to I purchase, not purchase, sell, or otherwise trade in this security or any type of security. I am not claiming to have presented all information in this post, you should do your own research and make your own decisions before trading. I am a novice with written up DD, constructive feedback is welcomed and appreciated.**

**I CURRENTLY HOLD BBRW STOCK:**

https://preview.redd.it/atge5qjjnkw41.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fa6b029fca9a5de4c0b2af2785942dd48589d3d

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview of BBRW:** BrewBilt Manufacturing Inc. is a California-based manufacturer of fermentation and distillation equipment for craft beer, cannabis, and hemp industries. BBRW was incorporated in 2014. They pride themselves on using ""Best in Class American made components integrated with stainless steel processing vessels using only American made steel"" (10K).

BrewBilt has traditionally targeted the craft beer industry, a $26B market in the United States. Since 2014, craft beer production in the United States has grown in sales by 5.7%. Through 2018, the number of active businesses in the craft beer industry has grown by 14.1%.

BrewBilt cites competitors as those who mostly buy and resell cheaper product from China.

In November of 2019, BBRW acquired VetOnlineSupply, a company that sells CBD-infused pet products. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials:**

At the year ended December 31,2019, BBRW had total liabilities of $6,810,483 ($2,273,269 of which is derivative from the merger with VOS) up from $2,663,114 the year prior. 

Total assets for 2019 were $949,010, down from $1,636,991 in 2018.

Gross profit from sales in 2019 was $380,387, down from $410,141 in 2018.

Total cash at the end of 2019 was $1,444, down from $43,285 in 2018.

BBRW's total shareholder equity is $949,010 but the market cap is only **around $320,000**. As u/ShitPostGuy pointed out, that means that you can buy all the outstanding stock for $622,000, and if the company were sold that day you'd be owed $949,010.

To note: BBRW deferred the revenue and related cost of sales in the sum of $1,511,096 and $1,905,346 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, in revenue, and $$53,038 and $344,134 in cost of sales, respectively. This is due typically to orders being placed in one year and fulfilled in the next. 

To note, a direct quote from the 10K: ""The Company has experienced net losses to date, and it has not generated sufficient revenue from operations to meet our operational overhead. We will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a growing concern. Management of the company is preparing a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding, short term or long-term financing or debt financing, to enable the Company to reach profitable operations. Historically, the Company's sole officer and director has provided short term loans to meet working capital shortfalls. We have recently entered into financing agreements with various third parties to meet our capital needs in fiscal 2020.""

Another important thing to note: Management has concluded that during FY 2018-2019, the internal accounting and financials procedures were not effective, but maintain and that there was no fraud. Since they are strapped for cash, ""we are not able to, and do not intend to, immediately take any action to remediate these material weaknesses....Notwithstanding the assessment that our ICFR was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe that our financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2019, fairly represents our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods covered.""

As of December 31, 2019, 5,000,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized, of which 10,343,330 shares issued and outstanding. 

**Upshot:** To me, the financials reflect pretty standard small-business startup situations: operating at a loss until they make enough money to cover their expenses. BBRW has the potential to fuck over any common stock investor and issuing a couple billion shares of stock, which would demolish anyone's holdings, or CEO P&amp;D that we saw most recently with UAVS. That, and they never escape the financial hole they're in and go under.

BBRW is currently projected to end this year with around $5 million in orders, which I don't need to tell you is significantly more than the $1.5 million from lat year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My view:** as you can see, I lost about half of my investment so far in BBRW, but in all honesty I'll probably be buying more since its so cheap. I do believe that this is an actual longer term investment stock, not a momentum rider where you can make a quick buck in a few days. I'll probably get in another 10k shares. I like the way the market sector is growing, I like the way they've diversified via the merger. The recent price drop has made this a great time to get into this stock, I believe.
