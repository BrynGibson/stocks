They have a higher Net income than market cap, this is unheard of. They are already profitable, and have high guidance. They tanked since IPO due to nobody knowing about them but that is changing.

I will highlight competitive advantages with brackets [].

So they run an algorithm that utilizes machine learning on [Chinese state owned computers]. They didn’t pay for the computing power but they own the algorithms. Their algorithms sort thru people to decide who to lend money to and who not to. So each person served improves the algorithm via machine learning.

Well they serve the [three largest telecom companies in China] and they are paid per facilitated loan.

If this was priced cheaply it would be worth $7. And that doesn’t take into account their future plans. They plan to expand into more broad loans and not just loans for telecommunication companies. They will be able to leverage their ever improving algorithms to gain even more companies that utilize their algorithms and that, in turn, will improve the algorithm even more. Kind of like Facebook or Google. So I’m seeing this stock grow no matter what.

Go compare this companies financials to any other company, it is a value play and a speculative play all in one. Worth a look.
