1,Good Platforms for a non-us resident/citizen.,9vvzk8,haniwa65,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vvzk8/good_platforms_for_a_nonus_residentcitizen/,1,0,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello people,

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting started in investing in penny stocks, however I am a non US resident nor a citizen. I hold both Bosnian and Palestinian nationalities which might be a little tricky when it comes to opening accounts internationally. 

Anyone recommend a good platform where it's possible to open an account internationally and start trading. Any tips or maybe recommended services for my situation? Thank you.",2018-11-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vvzk8/good_platforms_for_a_nonus_residentcitizen/

6,Why is Revolution Lighting trading at a 25% discount to the CEO's $2.00 offer to take it private?,9vvomq,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vvomq/why_is_revolution_lighting_trading_at_a_25/,1,5,"This is a microcap with a market capitalization of $35 million so its a high risk company.

At the same time, the tiny capitalization should mean its quite likely that CEO and largest shareholder Robert LaPenta should be able to see through his offer to take the company private at $2.00 a share.  He already owns 46% so the remainder should only cost $22.4 million. Yet the company closed on Friday at $1.50.

This is not a recommendation to buy.  Stocks not suitable for all investors. Please do your own research.
