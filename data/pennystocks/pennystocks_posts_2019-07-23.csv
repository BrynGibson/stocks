TARRYTOWN, NY, July 22, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE ‚Äì Nightfood, Inc. (OTCQB: NGTF), the fast-growing ice cream company addressing America‚Äôs $50 billion-dollar nighttime snacking problem, announced today that Nightfood was featured in the July issue of Oprah Magazine, the latest instance in a long series of prominent coverage by major consumer media outlets.

An image of a pint of Nightfood‚Äôs popular Cherry Eclipse flavor, along with a big scoop of the ice cream, is prominently featured on Page 74. The editorial recommended that people who prefer ice cream at night should try Nightfood as one of Oprah‚Äôs favorite ‚Äúsleep-friendly‚Äù finds.

‚ÄúOver 25 years in PR has taught me that you can‚Äôt fake enthusiasm for a product ‚Äì this kind of earned publicity is only achievable if you have a quality product that is new and interesting. The recent interest and coverage by some of the major outlets is an affirmation of fascination and interest in Nightfood Ice Cream as well as proof that consumers are excited,‚Äù commented Tim Sullivan, founder of Nightfood‚Äôs PR firm T3 Shamrock Media.¬† ‚ÄúWhat a great way to celebrate National Ice Cream Month! With Nightfood‚Äôs foray into custom flavors, we expect the launch of our celebrity flavors in a couple of months to bring a whole new wave of media interest.‚Äù

In the ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù Section of the July issue, Oprah Magazine featured a round-up of products to help readers have better nights. Included with Nightfood among the favorites were various other sleep friendly items such as moisture-wicking pajamas, a dream journal, and jasmine-scented eye masks.

‚ÄúWe are surprised and flattered to be selected for inclusion in such an influential and taste making publication as Oprah magazine. Along with recent features in The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, and The Washington Post, it all comes back to the fact that we‚Äôre doing something very important for the consumer,‚Äù added Nightfood CEO Sean Folkson. ‚ÄúPeople just cannot hear the phrase ‚Äòsleep-friendly ice cream‚Äô without stopping dead in their tracks. Having a product that captures the imagination of the everyday consumer injects powerful leverage into everything we do.¬† From earned publicity to advertising to influencer partnerships, all the way to driving consumer trial and revenue growth, our launch continues to gain tremendous momentum.‚Äù

Nightfood recently announced major celebrity partnerships with Michael Clifford, lead guitarist of award-winning, multi-platinum band 5 Seconds of Summer, and NFL all-world future Hall of Fame cornerback Richard Sherman. Within six months of manufacture of the first pint of Nightfood ice cream, the brand has secured distribution in four of the top-50 supermarket chains in the United States, including 2 of the top-10.

Management projects profitability in Q4 of 2019 on revenues of greater than $3 million as the brand continues to expand its distribution footprint across the country through major supermarkets, independent retailers, and alternative retail distribution channels.",2019-07-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cgrogs/ngtf_nightfood_sleepfriendly_ice_cream_featured/

RAHWAY, N.J., July 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE¬†‚Äì Spectacular Solar, Inc. (OTCPK: SPSO), is pleased to announce that the following share structure changes have been approved by the Nevada Secretary of State.  


Spectacular Solar has reduced the total Authorized Common Shares from 850,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 and a Series B Preferred class was designated and established with Authorized Shares set at 100,000,000. The preferred shares will carry a 1:1 ratio with common shares but each Series B Preferred Share will have three (3) times the voting power of a common share.

A resolution was passed to issue Spectacular Solar CEO Doug Heck 100,000,000 Preferred Shares upon his surrendering 100,000,000 of the 302,185,737 common shares which he currently holds. It was also resolved to retire these 100,000,000 shares which will subsequently reduce the O/S (Outstanding Shares) Count by about 15% which will result in a new O/S of 575,533,904.

Additionally, the Company believes that there may be some tangential benefits resulting from this share structure change, including:

1. that its amended capital structure will be more attractive to potential institutional investors, with respect to both open market support and private placement capital;
2. that it will likely be helpful in achieving its desired up-listing
3. that its amended capital structure will be far more attractive to a potential merger/acquisition candidate should the Company decide to utilize its equity as part of any such transaction

‚ÄúObviously, our main goal is to increase shareholder value by building the company through increasing sales and other operationally related efforts,‚Äù Heck said. ‚ÄúBut we saw the opportunity to make these changes in the share structure that, in addition to strengthening the general health of the company, also benefits the shareholder.‚Äù

PHOENIX, July 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE ‚Äì SinglePoint Inc. (OTCQB: SING) is pleased to announce Direct Solar has surpassed everyone‚Äôs expectations signing contracts to deploy $1,709,852 in solar installs over the past 30 days. Bringing the two month totals to $3,419,312 in contracts, $1,687,886 in revenue and $757,700 in net. Now that these are in contract they will move to the next phase in planning and installation. Most of the revenue derived from these contracts will be recognized throughout the third and fourth quarter. The previous 30 days should generate approximately $884,117 in gross and $396,159 in net.  


You can also listen to this Press release [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aou5z3hQR6hx3CbkihpSmh2Q8ipWvuOaf9SN6ZoURHsg06S5ZKcdVQ9u0o7jmLdLufWueXBiZw7D7_Jl_Hge1g==)

Currently Direct Solar is operational in 8 states and continues to expand its residential solar footprint. As the company has solidified itself and proven the model, many financing companies have approached to the company to start a commercial financing division. The first financing contract was signed last week and now the company will offer renewable energy options to commercial operations and have the ability to finance these larger scale projects. This additional market opens up a tremendous amount of opportunity in a currently underserved market.

As solar continues to gain traction and renewable energy becomes a top of mind conversation for many people, studies continue to pile up.
