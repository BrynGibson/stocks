The mines are still profitable even with the low price. They have also been expanding recently and speculating new mines which has been taxing on their financials. I don't see it going below .50 anytime soon unless something terrible happens. IMO its a good buy .60 or below. If it swings up to .80ish, dump for a quick profit. Good long term hold if you buy low.",2018-06-24

Even so, I'd say to proceed with caution since there's still a bunch of paperwork and procedural stuff to be done before BIOAQ will come with the major catalysts that everyone seems to be speculating on (dropping the Q, buy out, etc).  We're expecting financial filings tomorrow or Tuesday, but even if that gives it a jump, the gap in time between the filings and whatever's coming next might cause people to get impatient or bored and sell off which would give you a better opportunity to accumulate at a lower price.

Disclaimer: Or maybe I'm wrong and we'll gap to the moon tomorrow.  This is the OTC, after all.",2018-06-24
