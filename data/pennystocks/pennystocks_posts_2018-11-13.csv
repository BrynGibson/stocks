My criteria right now:
1. Consistent price history with predictable price changes (it's high then gets low and then gets high again after that.) 
2. Volatility average of roughly 300%
3. Avg daily volume of at least 100k

I have made two pennyatock trades currently. First one was a terrible buy so I lost money on it. Second trade was on the same stock later. Flipped it the next day for 14% profit after commissions. It cut the loss of trade #1 in half. So two more successful deals and I will be positive at that rate.

&gt; These pepper trials were automated and started from seeds. Controlled growth chambers used foliar spray at twenty-minute intervals with CO2 infused water dissolved at 1000 PPM. CO2 foliar sprayed plants showed a 10% fruit yield increase over CO2 gassed plants and 30% fruit yield increase over plants that were not gassed. Additionally,10% to 20% faster fruit ripening was shown versus the two control plant groups.

Also, the CO2 foliar spray which displayed distinctly superior results, used 50% less CO2 gas versus CO2 gassing at 800 PPM.

John Archibald, CEO of GROW stated, ""Until legal cannabis, the top two greenhouse crops in Canada were tomatoes at 38% and peppers at 33% of a 2015 estimated $1.3B vegetable greenhouse market. (Source: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada).

Our pepper results show the value superiority of our dissolved CO2 Foliar Spray technology over CO2 gassing and dramatic value superiority over no CO2 gassing of plants. We can add plant yield and speed to maturity value to any greenhouse or indoor grow facility that does not use CO2 gas, that does use CO2 gas or to the 95% of the world's plant food grown outdoors, where it has been impossible to add CO2. until now.

The Emergence of New CBD Products Dominating Cannabis Industry
November 13, 2018

Palm Beach, FL – (November 13, 2018) – According to the Brightfield Group, hemp-derived CBD, tinctures and oils – consumption forms focused on the ease of medicating – are making up nearly half (47%) of the total CBD market. In the marijuana-derived market tinctures and oils comprise just 7.4% of all sales, and sugar candy leads with 28% of the market. Conversely, in consumer surveys conducted by Brightfield, marijuana-derived CBD users did not report a higher preference for sugar candies than hemp users did. In fact, CBD users across the board ranked vape cartridges, tinctures, oils, and topicals as top choices as Brightfield reveals THC-dominant candies sell more.  Active cannabis companies in the markets this week include PotNetwork Holdings, Inc. (OTC:POTN), Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC) (TSX:WEED), Terra Tech Corp. (OTC:TRTC), Namaste Technologies Inc. (TSX-V:N) (OTC:NXTTF).
