21,NextGenCap,elmqogr,/r/pennystocks/comments/bgo1jw/imtl_ready_for_that_001_break/elmqogr/,1,"List of Reasons to Buy

1. Matt Goldman held high level roles at Getty's Images, Corbis, and Jupiter Media. Jupiter Media was purchased by Getty's in 2008 for $100mm (originally the deal was for $350mm but the recession hit prior to closing). Getty's was bought and sold by KKR for $3bb and recently announced they were going to try to execute this same business model. Gettys buys up all their competitors and for that reason along with Goldman's connections to the major players and the fact that Image Protect already has the tech and managed images, makes this a buyout play AT WORST. 
2. On top of offering a potentially disruptive technology, they already have real revenue and are close to profitability even before they release their premium technology. I look around and see $IRNC, $SSFT, $SHMP, etc. all companies with minimal revenues valued at much higher levels than this, but all offer less sustainable revenues, if any at all. Once images start to get shared, the growth of revenue is exponential as more people see them and continue to share them. 
3. The model is mutually beneficial for all parties. It allows both infringers, consumers, and copyright holders the ability to generate revenue or get access to premium images for free. By solving a free-rider problem (i.e. the first buyer of a photo from Gettys images is paying to protect it into perpetuity) $IMTL's model can be much more cost effective compared with Gettys and undercut their market share. 
4. MadHive. So far this partnership has been substantially underrated. MadHive's nonprofit was started by IBM and Tegna (both multi-billion dollar companies). Hersheys just also agreed to sign on and work with MadHive to improve adfraud and revolutionize digital advertising. Whereas MadHive is building the roadways for more secure and effective digital advertising, Tegna/IBM/Hersheys (""TIH"") etc. are those looking to use the roadways to their benefit. The catalyst in TIH being able to use these roadways adquately is prefaced on their ability to generate content in a way that can be accessed easily by the masses. That is where IMTL comes in. TIH can use any image etc. found on IMTLs database (or generate their own and embed it with IPShare so that others cannot take it) and easily generate ad traffic, which in turn generates passive revenue for those who use and own the rights to the photos. 
5. Current clients. Their current clients range from celebrity photographers, to medium level photo marketplaces, to the #1 adult entertainer in the world (and for those of you who have not thought about it, $IMTL will revolutionize the adult content space as videos and images will no longer be able to be pirated). If even a fraction of their clients use their website, that is 20mm photos, no problem. With regards to Gettys and Shutterstock, for every photo they manage it adds about $5 to their revenue annually. Once $IMTL begins to generate traction when they release IPShare and later fotofy (mind you IPShare set to drop before May 6) then if they can generate 1/2 per photo thats still $50mm in revenue. 

&amp;#x200B;

List of Reasons Not To Buy (So that I don't seem completely biased)

1. Execution has been, at times, lackluster. In my opinion this stems from Larry Adams, however as of 6 months ago Adams has passed the torch to Goldman and has allowed Goldman much more autonomy in how this company operates. Now, I don't know a ton about L.A., but I think he does generate some value in the form of connections in the industry. But with regards to operations, I place way more trust in Matt Goldman and Jonathon Thomas (who also has an awesome background of his own). 
2. Dilution. Yes, dilution has occurred here, but is that really that big of a problem..... What that means is, this company has cash to operate, that dilution should be done now since it has already been happening, and an extra 20mm shares isn't going to make or break the value on such an undervalued play--especially in the next month or so. Larry adams has been buying. Both Goldman and Thomas own substantial shares. Why would they continue to hold and continue to buy if they were going to turn around and dilute. IMO the dilution came from note holders who saw the writing on the wall and decided that the time is near for IMTL to pop and wanted their shares for when that occurred.",2019-04-24
