They have close to $4M in debt (3% increase from 2017), nearly half of which appears to be backlogged compensation owed to employees. They only have $1M in cash and don't appear to have much in the way of other assets. The cornerstone acquisition is reported to be worth $700K in total. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, the CEO's salary amounts to over $1,000,000 and was increased from 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though their margin of around 80% and doubled revenue year over year is encouraging, this isn't as good as it seems because it came at the cost of a higher loss because of increased operating expenses. So, I don't see any reason to think they're going to be able to pay off this debt without executing a substantial offering, since it doesn't appear that they'll become profitable anytime soon.
