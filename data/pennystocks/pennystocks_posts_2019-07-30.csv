17,IMTL - Heating up,cjnykn,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cjnykn/imtl_heating_up/,14,18,"I had been shown IMTL back in May of this year. I decided to go with TTCM and revisit IMTL. Now that Iâ€™m out of TTCM and looking for a new play I seen where someone posted on IMTL and I remembered I had put it on the back burner. Iâ€™ve been doing DD and decided to take a position yesterday afternoon about the time the volume started picking up. 

Below are a couple links I found interesting. There is a fair amount of news on IMTL out in the last few months if you dig. Most can be found by a simple news search. 

Iâ€™m a little confused as to how the CEOâ€™s are structured. You have a Lawrence Adams that is apparently CEO of Image Protect and you also find Matthew Goldman who depending on the source is CEO of IMTL, or either Fotofy. 

I couldnâ€™t find much info on Lawrenceâ€™s past but Matthewâ€™s LinkedIn account shows his work history back to the early 90â€™s. You can search out the companies he was affiliated with. 

All in all I feel this is a safe play for the current entry level. They have a partnership agreement with  KODAKOne and are rolling out their Fotofy platform out possible this week. Iâ€™m thinking rollout will be beta only at first which is good because that gives the stock time to be PRâ€™d, accumulated, and allow the SP to grow before the final news drop.

I loaded yesterday, as did several others. The volume picked up over double the 10day average. News is starting to fly and people are starting to buzz. With the release (whether beta or public) of the new platform and with the partnership with KodakOne, and with the obvious pump that is warming up I think thereâ€™s some money to be made here.  

I will continue to DD and plz pass along any positives or negatives that you may find. Do your own DD!!! Always!!!  I think the risk is worth it here but thatâ€™s based on my own digging,  and the fact that Iâ€™m risking free money I made off  of TTCM.   ;)

Pass along relevant info and Iâ€™ll do the same.
