KUTG 10-Q available here:¬†

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1662684/000114420419026023/tv520650\_10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1662684/000114420419026023/tv520650_10q.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 months ended March 31, 2019 KUTG generated $194,952 in revenue for a gross profit of $133,435 (Gross margin: 68%). Total Operating Expenses of $698,683 or loss from operations of $565,248.

Some Key Takeaways from 10-Q:¬†

1) By leveraging our proprietary cooling solutions and that have been developed through longstanding partnerships with NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab and others, our products and services make E-Mobility products and other products safer and more stable.¬† Our management believes that the E-Mobility industry has created and will create significant new opportunities for the application of our technology and know-how.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

2) After strenuous testing, we believe we have developed heat management solutions that significantly improve upon traditional heat storage and dissipation solutions and that improve upon their rigidity and durability. We also believe that the traditional solutions are not equipped to handle the evolving marketplace. However, through a combination of custom design services and provision of proprietary hardware solutions, our products reduce manufacturing complexity and provide a lighter weight solution than traditional thermal management materials and, we believe, can meet the heat management demands of components and batteries being designed into the newest mobile technologies and applications.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

3) Our customers and prospective customers are large organizations with multiple levels of management, controls/procedures, and contract evaluation/authorization. Furthermore, our solutions are new and do not necessarily fit into pre-existing patterns of purchase commitment. Accordingly, the business activity cycle between expression of initial customer interest to shipping, acceptance and billing can be lengthy, unpredictable and lumpy, which can influence the timing, consistency and reporting of sales growth.

**SACRAMENTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 15, 2019 /** Falcon Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: FLCN) announced today that a representative for Falcon Technologies, Inc. will be attending the May 31st Food and Drug Administration meeting for scientific data and information about products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds.

Falcon Technologies is a public company focused on the marketing, sale, and distribution of CBD products and products derived from industrial hemp. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the goal of the hearing is to obtain additional scientific data and other information related to cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, both from botanical and synthetic sources, to inform our regulatory oversight of these products. Falcon Technologies is proud to be a participant at this historic meeting of the United States Food and Drug Administration.

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Public Law 115-334 (the 2018 Farm Bill), which, among other things removed the plant Cannabis sativa L. or ""hemp"" from the Controlled Substances Act has dramatically increased the need for CBD science and and to educate the public on CBD products such as the ones Falcon are developing. The 2018 Farm Bill has also dramatically increased the demand for hemp-derived products. Falcon is 100 percent focused on the development, marketing and sale of CBD products and hemp-derived products.

Many of the participants at the FDA meeting will be leaders in the CBD industry, leading scientists, leading medical doctors and political heavyweights who have been instrumental in the legalization of the industrial hemp and the products derived from hemp including hemp protein, hemp oil and hemp seeds.

William J. Delgado, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Technologies stated, ""We are excited Falcon will be represented at this very important meeting. The FDA understands the importance of CBD but also understands the importance of regulating CBD and other hemp-derived products.""

CBD (Cannabidiol) is one of at least 80 active cannabinoids identified in both cannabis and industrial hemp. It is a major constituent of both plants, although the percentages of total composition can vary greatly from strain to strain. Unlike THC (the other prevalent cannabinoid), CBD is non-psychoactive while having the potential to possess a variety of therapeutic properties.",2019-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bozuyp/flcn_falcon_technologies_announces_its/
