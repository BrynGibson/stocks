*This is my opinion but I’m usually right lol

$RTTR (Ritter Pharmaceuticals) also known as Ritter, has announced that their lead product, RP-G28, has the potential to become the first FDA-approved treatment for lactose intolerance, a condition that affects millions worldwide. RP-G28 has been studied in Phase 2 trials and is now in Phase 3 clinical development.  What does this mean for us investors? Well, if the FDA approves this treatment we are talking about major profits for a stock that’s merely 20 cents a share. They go on by stating “We are further exploring the functionality and discovering the therapeutic potential gut microbiome changes may have on treating/preventing a variety of conditions including: gastrointestinal diseases, immuno-oncology, metabolic, and liver disease.” 

Can this be the next big pharmaceutical stock?

What do y’all think? And what other stocks do you think have potential?",2020-02-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/faxw9r/rttr_ritter_pharmaceuticals_will_be_the_next_big/
