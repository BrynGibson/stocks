1,$GFOX Solid,8i5s92,dlipseir,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8i5s92/gfox_solid/,2,0,"$GFOX Just created their twitter page and claims that there are many new and exciting updates to come soon. They just released their website on May 7th as well. 

Recent tweets:

""$gfox interim mngmt will be releasing share structure shortly on web site and strides made so far to retire all convertible debt with various creditors. All positive in our opinion."" - May 8th

""Good evening $gfox followers our share structure link will go live as public info, as early as tomorrow. Thank you for your  support $gfox management"" -May 8th

The buying pressure came in big at the last minute when GFOX released the tweet regarding the share structure. We could see some follow up buying this morning as the stock dipped to a low of .0011 yesterday down from a high of .0019. Could be a nice starter PPS for GFOX this morning IMO.

2,$ADAC Bottom Ready For Pop,8i5qob,dlipseir,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8i5qob/adac_bottom_ready_for_pop/,2,0,"$ADAC has hit bottom for a while now and is due for a reversal big time. The company is constantly coming out with awesome PR and has several contracts with the US Military. The have announced that more contracts are on the way and are currently putting the finishing touches on the parts they are making for the US Airforce fighter jets. This is a solid company with multiple contracts and more in the pipeline, they have revs and will be having record revs very soon. This stock can take off at any moment i would keep it on watch. Good entry is anything below .018 IMO. It hit .0155 which was literally free money IMO.

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2018 / Applied BioSciences Corp. (OTCQB: APPB), a diversified cannabinoid therapeutics company focused on the medical, bioceutical and pet health industries, today announced that the Company's wholly-owned animal health subsidiary TherPet has entered the equine health space with the launch of a new full-spectrum hemp-derived cannabidiol (""CBD"") supplement formulated specifically for a horse's health and wellness.

TherPet's Equine Care CBD line is a natural supplement designed to play a key role in keeping horses, healthy, looking good and performing their best. Our Equine Care CBD products support healthy skin, joints and immune system as well as to ease the discomfort of fatigued muscles, stiff joints and arthritis pain.

Like humans, horses also have an endocannabinoid system comprised of cannabinoid receptors that help regulate a wide variety of bodily functions ranging from pain relief to mood.

""Regularly supplementing a horse's endocannabinoid system with full-spectrum CBD enables horses to better control inflammatory responses naturally,"" noted JJ Southard, Vice President of Products at Applied BioSciences Corp. ""Despite millions of spectators tuning in to watch twenty of the fastest thoroughbred horses compete in the Kentucky Derby this past weekend, very few of them realize or consider the race-induced inflammation and injuries that take place during such an event.""

David Horohov, Ph.D., William Robert Mills Chair at the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center, believes that horses as a breed are not necessarily becoming more fragile, but rather more susceptible to injury due to breeding strategies, training methods, and increased drug use. The Company hopes to reverse this trend by making Therpet's new treatment options available immediately for veterinarians, trainers, and equestrians.

Therpet's Equine Care tincture is available in a 4800 mg concentration which is packaged in a 4 fl. Oz. (120ml) bottle. The tincture is a naturally formulated Apple flavor, made with lab tested, CO2 extracted, pure full-spectrum CBD oil sourced from pesticide-free, Colorado grown hemp and specially formulated to be the highest bioavailability CBD products in the marketplace.

TherPet products are USDA NOP certified organic, non-GMO, vegan, paleo, gluten-free, sugar-free and THC-free. The products are formulated with organic 99%+ pure cannabidiol along with our proprietary blend of certified organic botanical, herbal and essential oils to further optimize bioavailability.
