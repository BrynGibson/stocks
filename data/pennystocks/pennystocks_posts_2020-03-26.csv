Past update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/fjxown/ogen_holding_its_own/).

Highlights from the presentation:

* Asian companies from Japan, China, and S Korea have approached Oragenics about AG013 and several are now under confidentiality agreements. Deals are pending P2 results.
* They are now saying early April for P2 results.
* Discusses the market potential.
* Discusses the lantibiotics in the pipeline.

It's still all good news. The CEO addresses the subjects with the predisposition that results are good. Time to buy, add, and hold in my opinion.

As a side note, we got a little market relief from the unlimited QE announcement and stimulus anticipation. I do not believe we've found the market bottom, at all. Deaths are about to mount significantly and new unemployment claims from last week are going to be staggering.

OGEN has held its own in this market, but ups and downs should be expected until results.",2020-03-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fp47i0/ogen_conference_presentation/

IBIO was fun, but the company is looking less and less likely like it can even sustain it self, after constanting pumping out press releases how they are working on a cure for COVID-19 lol. 

 [http://investingbulletin.com/2020/03/has-ibio-pharma-ibio-dropped-the-ball-compared-to-aytu-bioscience-aytu-in-the-race-to-establish-themselves-as-leaders-in-covid-19-competition/](http://investingbulletin.com/2020/03/has-ibio-pharma-ibio-dropped-the-ball-compared-to-aytu-bioscience-aytu-in-the-race-to-establish-themselves-as-leaders-in-covid-19-competition/) 

A little snipit....

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;However, as the weeks go on analysts have more time to analyze which company, IBIO vs AYTU, has what it takes to keep up with the immense momentum needed to survive the virus-affected global markets. It now appears that ultimately, the coronavirus isn’t a sustainable business model for iBio. And unlike biotechnology giants and COVID-19 competitors **Gilead Sciences** (NASDAQ:[**GILD**](https://aytubio.com/)) and **Regeneron** (NASDAQ:[**REGN**](https://aytubio.com/)), the stock isn’t well-positioned to move beyond this disease.  
&gt;  
&gt;*To be fair, IBIO stock’s dangling coronavirus carrot could prove a quick windfall for the company, if in fact it finds a vaccine which works. But as InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango points out,* [*COVID-19 is still a one-off event*](https://investorplace.com/2020/03/ibio-stock-coronavirus-real-gamble/)*. It’s also important to be mindful of overzealous self-promotion on Wall Street. And by my count, since iBio shares were first plucked out of obscurity last month, the bulk of reporting has been press releases alerting investors to iBio’s potential.*",2020-03-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fp2uuj/report_looks_like_ibio_might_not_survive_after/
16,Lost investments,fp1sqi,AcrobaticWord2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fp1sqi/lost_investments/,1,8,"I posted yesterday about these stocks.  One more reminder, don’t chase them.  Down 10k today which is half of my investments account.  I have a business in Canada where most of my contracts were cancelled, I felt pressure to make risky investments and it backfired.  I definitely have a gambling problem as I bet 30k on a hand of BJ when I had 17k and 15k credit card cash to my name - obviously lost, so stocks aren’t for me.  On indexes if I want to retire.

For any new people here, don’t buy a stock after it’s up 100% or more.  I have found maybe 1/5 will run more than a day, but all the times it dumps 25-70%, you can’t come out ahead.

The only strategy I can recommend is gamble with what you are ok with losing and park your money in a stock with potential - under 50k market cap if you want 100% gains.

Luckily with weather getting nicer we have secured about 3 weeks of contracts so I won’t be losing my house or having to go on unemployment",2020-03-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fp1sqi/lost_investments/

&gt;BOCA RATON, Florida, March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- StemSation International, Inc. (OTC PINK: STSN) – a pioneer in the emerging category of dietary supplements called Stem Cell Nutrition, announces its home-based business model provides an opportunity for a primary or secondary source of income by utilizing web-based audio and video conferencing tools directly from home for marketing, communications and training purposes.   
&gt;  
&gt;According to financial experts, a global recession is starting to look more likely. An increase in unemployment causes people to look for other financial opportunities to support their families. People desire a solution that will give them more control over their future income. StemSation  provides that solution as it relies on person-to-person sales by independent representatives, often working from home utilizing various web-based audio and video conferencing tools such as Go To Meeting, Ring Central, Vonage, Zoom and Skype that allow users to meet online, with or without video. Stemsation's direct selling business offers you the ability to build, track and manage a network of independent business partners to assist with growth of sales revenue and income, utilizing a proprietary ""BackOffice"" software platform with your personalized website included. Because direct selling is a low-barrier opportunity (it doesn't require a large investment, minimum educational skills or prior business experience) anyone 18 years or older can start a direct selling home-based business.  Success is driven by the amount of time and effort put into sharing the unique benefits of the StemSation products with others. This makes StemSation an attractive opportunity for those who wish to overcome certain risks associated with a recession.  [https://www.stemsation.global/www/en/us/join/compensation/](https://www.stemsation.global/www/en/us/join/compensation/). ",2020-03-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fpb8z2/stsn_release_big_news_this_morning_offering/

When people post on here to do your own research, don't underestimate what they are saying. Don't follow the hype, by the time it's posted on this sub (most of the time) you find yourself buying at the peak for it to just dip and dip. 

Not putting this sub down because there are some positives:

Every once in a while you'll find something in time before it blows up. 
Sometimes people post good reliable news 
If your just getting into (like me) you can find a lot of advice and tips

THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS SUB:
When I do my research, and find a stock I love, this is a excellent sub to check if people are commenting about it. And nothing is better than not finding that stock I absolutely love on any post in this sub.

Today, I introduce you to USO. I like this one tremendously. It had a slight dagger fall, and then downtrend to the point of a shocking outside bar &amp; a HODL position leading up to a curl/Cupping. 

[USO Chart](https://ibb.co/Ptdd2C4)

As you can clearly see, the bottom touched at 4.29. Individuals began testing it to see whether it would curl up or not, and it did with support levels 4.29 - 4.64 (very fair). The gap has a nice window at $10, which in my honest opinion huge window opportunity.

Pros: 

Small resistance window $5

Strong EPS

Severely oversold outside down trend line (see finiv also)

92,OPPORTUNITY: Another MFA Short Squeeze Inbound?,fphvpr,megamastergamer,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fphvpr/opportunity_another_mfa_short_squeeze_inbound/,3,38,"At the start of the 2020 recession I saw MFA Mortgage Investments Inc. drop from its high of over $8.00 to a measly $0.50c, though yesterday (March 25th), an inevitable short squeeze happened and went parabolic, skyrocketing to $1.14 at close, a **356% increase**. Today in the pre-market, we had another surge in purchases which launched it to $2.25, almost **doubling** the price from yesterday's close.

I believe that tomorrow we will be primed for another short squeeze. Currently there is almost 7 million short interest. This stock's **AVERAGE** volume is merely \~4.5 million shares. The current short interest ratio (basically the max amount of time we expect shorts to cover their position by purchasing shares) is only 1.6 days. Along with that, the bull volume was insane at open today, and we have a lot of people taking their profits, which gives further fuel for the shorts. 

 [https://imgur.com/a/GPXjwMJ](https://imgur.com/a/GPXjwMJ) 

If you take a look at that graph, we currently have the next line of resistance at over $4.00 giving this a lot of upward potential. Along with that, once MFA broke out from downwards trend line was when we saw the parabolic gains. Right now, even though its falling a bit, we have it finding itself well above the upwards tend line we saw from its jumps.

Is anyone else hopping in on the MFA train?
