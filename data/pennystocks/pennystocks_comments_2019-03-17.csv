But there‚Äôs a saying, ‚Äòthose who can‚Äôt do, teach.‚Äô Tim made the bulk of his money around the dot com bubble when markets were extremely volatile. Tim‚Äôs skills didn‚Äôt hold up though. He started a couple hedge funds, all of which ultimately lost money. After his insane winning streak it was clear his strategy didn‚Äôt hold up. So he started teaching. If you haven‚Äôt you should watch Wall Street Warriors, it features Tim Sykes and he was not a very successful trader.

I say this to say, if you get 10,000 people and tell them each to play 7 turns of roulette and double down with each win you are guaranteed to have someone double their money 7 times. Tim was that person.

Now the reason he has to teach is because his strategy almost strictly revolves around targeting low volume stocks which is advantageous for smaller accounts and disadvantageous for larger accounts - hence you see Steve venturing into more and more expensive equities.",2019-03-17
