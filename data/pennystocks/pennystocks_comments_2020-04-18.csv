Yes it is important to start small so you don‚Äôt lose all of your investment but $100 even in penny stocks is hard to do. You would have to profit more to get ahead and could easily lose it all. I know from my first year because 5 of my penny stocks eventually tanked out and never recovered. I lost over $2,000 starting dec 2018 and somehow managed to pull myself back by starting over and over with my $500 work paycheck. You‚Äôre going to need consistent gains to get ahead, so I would try to find something with enough volatility where you can profit quickly in the morning and get out. Getting out consistently is a hard lesson I needed to learn because if I didn‚Äôt I never would have gotten ahead. I was in the same shoes of broke desperation, if there‚Äôs one thing I really think you should take from this is to NOT rush any trades. Chasing can quickly throw any gains you‚Äôve managed to make down the toilet. Stay patient, find your system aka your ‚Äúbread &amp; butter‚Äù, and once you have a profit pile to lean on then take more risk. Locking in those small percentages first is key. Eventually a quick 2-10% profit could be a good portfolio boost when you have $10,000 to work with.",2020-04-18

But are you looking for cash now or cash in a decade. Seeing as its penny stocks I assume the quick buck. I suggest reading just simple google searches on trading, the terms, and build your understanding.

The app you use is dependent upon your need, do your research, compare contrast each one, some require huge money to have, others are free but have less features etc.

The dollar amount is up to you. My main thing in investing is confidence it wont turn south, and if it does go south know how much your willing to lose, and how long your willing to wait for a upturn. Getting out is smarter than losing it all if your gonna need the cash sooner than later.

1 share gets you a penny every penny the price changes

10 shares is a dime per penny 

100 is a dollar

1000 is 10 bucks

10k is 100 bucks

100k is 1k

So penny stocks have the chance of turning $200 into 1-200k shares thus losing/earning $0.01-$2000. 
Example, nvidia vs tptw. 

Dont lie to her. Straight up gambling. You should reassure her, discuss it, your a couple.  Is it extra cash, how long do you have to gamble it, how much can you lose, how much do you need to gain, what industries do you support or despise morally etc, she could have insight.

They can slice the pie up any way they want. Just pulling a couple random examples, $CWAFF is a $1.2B company trading for $0.73/share, while $TAPM is a $1.4M company trading for $2.60/share. So if you're looking to throw a few thousand bucks at a company hoping they'll become a big growth story and get bought or make it to the big leagues, you want to look at ""market capitalization"" (size of the company) and not just share price. 

To answer your question about sub-penny stocks, the term ""penny stock"" refers to any stock that is both less than $5.00/share and less than $1B market capitalization, so any stock trading for less than $0.01 is still a penny stock.

If I were you, I would be careful about following any kind of penny stock hype train, as these could be pump and dumps and as a new investor it's hard to tell. I would find a company that excites you, maybe look at the industry, dig through the company's website, check out the twitter/linkedin of company leaders, read the SEC filings if you're feeling ambitious, and just find something that you really believe in its potential. This method I'm suggesting involves a lot of digging through trash stocks, but I think you'd learn a lot this way.",2020-04-18

Your advice/command potentially lost him money and made me second guess myself. Yeah I came back 27 days later, also,  I have no chill. I wish you the best. As for me, I sold half of my ACB for a profit and am sitting on the rest. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lotto winner, that sector is the next gold mine- based off your name  ‚ÄúAlamobrick‚Äù Gotta be in Texas where your not seein the lines of cars at the dispensary‚Äôs-",2020-04-18

I had a sour taste for ACB at the time of that comment because I felt like I had done enough DD to do the same and it had done nothing but tank time after time. the last straw was management unloading shares at the slightest bump. I don‚Äôt disagree that marijuana stock is a profitable sector but it is also a saturated sector and maybe I didn‚Äôt have the patience for the 30% gain from the time of the comment to now.  I‚Äôll admit when I‚Äôm wrong, and you‚Äôre right my words may have had influence especially with the slue of comments that agreed with me but clearly I‚Äôm not the only one who thought that way.",2020-04-18

Your decision wasn‚Äôt a bad one- you just saw it differently than I did- I‚Äôm always looking for a different point of view on my own research- I‚Äôm heavy into Tlss decn an rmbl an still holding on aCB - you got any different opinions on those companies?

It is priced at .15 so your budget will go far. The company has a lot of debt so the stock dropped from 1.75 (last year) to .03 this spring. But, because of COVID-19, the company's revenues have suddenly climbed. And, last month, they laid off staff and sold some properties to make production leaner. These measures are working so the stock has quietly climbed from .03 to .16. It's only going to go up from here so grab some while it's affordable!",2020-04-18
