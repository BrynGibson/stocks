0,Does Merinus Pharmaceuticals (MRNS) seem ready to climb towards price target?,azq6ce,ddub965,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/azq6ce/does_merinus_pharmaceuticals_mrns_seem_ready_to/,1,0,"Seems like a whole lot on MRNS portends a massively undervalued stock‚Äîi.e., initiated phase 3 study last week on key drug ganaxolone; failure last week of competitor Allergan's drug in late-stage testing; key institutional investors, including Blackrock, substantially upgrading positions in recent weeks; one-year consensus price targets several multiples beyond current price, including based on some recent initiations and reaffirmations, driving significant upside that's hard to totally ignore; and various technical indicators (albeit not all, of course) signaling a buy, etc., etc.

No doubt looks like a frustrating story for a long time. However, as of right now, do you see anything differently that makes you think this is a bad play, or otherwise too risky or uncertain?",2019-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/azq6ce/does_merinus_pharmaceuticals_mrns_seem_ready_to/

I had a ton of people messaging me to put up some sort of a watchlist after the $BPTH spike.

$YTRA strong PR this morning which lead to a nice 44% climb so far today. $5.15 is the main support with the VWAP support right underneath that mark. Top RES is $5.50. Keep on watch for a Lunch Hour fade and a few bounce play opportunities. If this stock can hold $5 until this afternoon, we could see its next leg up! 

$GLBS Stay away at this time, unpredictable low volume shipper. 

$AQB write down for a mid candle breakout pattern tomorrow. 

$AWSM I really like this chart setup, potential small swing for a spike in the near future. 13ema and 200 Day MA squeeze. $BPTH $27 Support with $30 top RES. Break of either of these lines watch for volume to move in.

Here is the TLDR *in my opinion*

1) they will use this stock as part of the very first LGBTQ promoted ETF fund.
2) they get big name LGBTQ supporters to invest and back it up.
3) they already have multiple investment firms tied into it.

The stock is pretty much built on branding, in my opinion.

If you believe in the LGBTQ community getting stronger, it's a easy good buy.

If you think the LGBTQ community is going to get destroyed, and all their members thrown in jail or quieted, then it's a bad buy. 

I personally think equal rights is here to stay, so I think the stock will win.

(OTCQB: KUTG), (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúKULR‚Äù), today announced that it will provide its internal short circuit (ISC) battery testing device to battery manufacturer Saft, a Total Company (NYSE: TOT), for ongoing research into battery safety.  

&amp;#x200B;

The ISC was developed in 2015 by researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and NASA and reliably creates failures in lithium-ion battery cells in controlled, laboratory conditions. The failures triggered by the ISC replicate cell failures that, although rare, can happen in a wide variety of commercial and consumer battery uses. By replicating cell failures, designers and researchers can study methods and systems to reduce battery failures as well as design systems to mitigate their consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

As the exclusive provider of the ISC, KULR will deliver ISC devices beginning in Q2 of 2019. Further details of the arrangement were not released but company leaders highlighted the importance of this agreement and possible advancements of battery safety.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWe are very proud to be working with leaders at NASA and NREL in sharing the break-through ISC technology as part of our ongoing commitment to making safer and more efficient batteries,‚Äù said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also very excited to work with leading battery maker Saft in helping them advance their research into battery reliability and safety, which is work we know will pay off for their customers and partners.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúSaft is committed to making the safest and most reliable batteries as we possibly can,‚Äù said Dr. Kamen Nechev, Chief Technology Officer of Saft. ‚ÄúOur team will continue to design, test, and innovate with the singular goal of providing the best battery solutions to our customers.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The ISC replicates latent defects in batteries which can be some of the most common, serious, and hardest cell failures to detect. Unfortunately other lithium-ion cell testing methods such as mechanical (crush, nail penetration), thermal (heat to vent, thermal cycling) and electrical (overcharge, off-limits cycling) are all simply ‚Äúnot relevant to the latent-defect‚Äìinduced field failure,‚Äù according to a 2015 NASA and NREL presentation. The ISC break-through received the prestigious R&amp;D100 Award in 2016 and was the runner-up NASA invention of the year in 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Saft, headquartered in France, is a leading global battery manufacturer with more than 3,000 customers in 18 countries.

ER announced after hours today appears to further prove it's getting hotter. 

It was announced today that the Virtual LTO patent was granted late last year. 

Conference Call tomorrow morning. I think we'll see a healthy spike in SP as it seems a bit undervalued below $1.00.

Good things on the horizon for this FlexShopper, it appears.

I encourage DD on this one as figures like Howard Dvorkin and his other interests warrant research.

But what I am trying to understand/learn is when do you buy? The moment trading begins? Or do you wait  30 mins...? Or is it already too late. 

I messed up last week with SEEL in that I bought at the start of trading. It turned out that for this stock the start was too costly. Now I'm waiting for some recovery so I can get my money back...at least.

But let's say for tomorrow KYNC is on several watchlists. When do you buy.
