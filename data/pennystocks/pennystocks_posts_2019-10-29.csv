(the “Company” or “PreveCeutical”)** (CSE: PREV, OTCQB: PRVCF, FSE: 18H), is pleased to announce the successful completion of the design, synthesis and preliminary evaluation of key peptides from its scorpion venom-derived peptide research and development program (the “**Peptide Program**”). The Peptide Program is expected to enable the Company to develop their own proprietary, Nature IdenticalTM, peptide therapeutics, which are intended for therapeutic applications. PreveCeutical’s initial therapeutic focus was to understand the activities of such peptides in cell-based brain cancer models.

In the first stages of the Peptide Program, PreveCeutical’s research partner successfully identified four peptides that individually inhibit the activity of a target protein (the “**Target Protein**”) implicit in the progression of certain brain cancers (see news release dated March 11, 2019).

In the final stage of the Peptide Program, the four peptides were further tested in a number of *in vitro* studies in certain brain cancer cell lines and also in a patient-derived neural oncosphere cell line of a brain cancer. Screening of the four peptides in an invasion assay model showed that they had ability to reduce the invasion potential in brain cancer cell types (see news release dated April 10, 2019). The Company believes that this is an important development given that “invasion” is a key driver of the aggressiveness, rapid spread and poor prognosis commonly associated with certain brain cancers.

From these studies, two peptides showed the most potential for further development as therapeutic agents in the management of certain brain cancers. These two lead peptides were able to inhibit the activity of the Target Protein, which resulted in an obvious slowing of invasion, with the reduction in invasion particularly being seen in the oncospheres. The two peptides also displayed modest suppression of an important cancer cell marker, which has a role in promoting cancer spread/metastasis and is also associated with drug and immune resistance in brain cancer. Both lead candidates are a fraction of the size and structural complexity of Chlorotoxin, a scorpion venom-derived peptide known to target brain cancer cells from scientific literature.

PreveCeutical is now accelerating the process of evaluating options on how best to progress the two lead peptide drug candidates, which may include partnering to expedite their pre-clinical evaluation. The pre-clinical outcomes, along with the Company’s IP coverage, would have the

potential to demonstrate proof of concept and enable the Company to further extend dialogue with

pharma R &amp; D / biotech companies active in the therapeutic neuro-oncology space.

PreveCeutical’s President and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Mak Jawadekar stated, “We are indeed quite excited to have accomplished further strides towards proof of concept for these innovative Nature IdenticalTM peptide therapeutics for application into the neuro-oncology therapeutic area and look forward to progressing them through proof of concept studies.”",2019-10-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/doufl4/preveceutical_announces_successful_completion/

***Acquisition Enables Telemedicine and Telehealth Services***

**TAMPA,** **FL** **/ ACCESSWIRE /** **October 29, 2019 /** Trxade Group, Inc. (OTCQB:[TRXD](http://pr.report/y2wgQ39m)) (""Trxade"" or the ""Company""), an integrated pharma supply chain and care platform, announced today the acquisition of certain assets of Bonum Health, a comprehensive telemedicine and telehealth platform ([www.bonumhealth.com](http://pr.report/P1jIvr3B)). The easy to use technology platform, which was acquired, is designed for consumers to have provider and pharmacist tele-consults and order medications to be delivered directly to the home. Additionally, we plan for independent pharmacies to have onsite Bonum health kiosks with clinical services which will allow them to compete with national retail chain pharmacies on pricing, service offerings and patient satisfaction. Bonum Health is an important strategic advancement for Trxade in its mission to disrupt the ineffective and inefficient pharma and consumer care value chain. The acquired assets build on the established Trxade B2B drug procurement marketplace platform for Independent Pharmacists and Trxade's Wholesale and Mail Order Pharmacy capabilities by making meds and care services more affordable and convenient to the consumer.

Key features and benefits of the acquisition:

* The ability to provide tele-consults with providers and pharmacists regarding prescriptions written and delivered to the home. 
* The provision of an all-in-one non-emergency medical service platform that gives patients easy access to a network of 800 licensed medical providers to address their healthcare needs and ailments.
* Patients will be able to experience convenience and privacy in managing their overall health and wellness as the platform encompasses primary care, physical and health screening, dermatology and allergy testing, and behavioral health at an affordable cost.
* Bonum kiosks will benefit independent pharmacists, both in urban and rural areas, by offering additional care services and enabling closer working relationships with local and community physicians and care providers.

""We are very excited about the Bonum Health asset acquisition as it further advances the Trxade mission of providing prescription drugs and patient care at a higher level of convenience with a lower cost,"" said Trxade Chief Executive Officer, Suren Ajjarapu, ""Bonum Health is a strategic, complementary addition to the Trxade family with its strong history of delivering high-quality telemedicine and telehealth solutions.""

The stock is up big today, wondering if it will stick.
