With penny stocks you want to spend a lot of time researching the management and Board of Directors. 

Use quotations ""John doe"" in a Google search to isolate web pages that have information about the person.

TRNX said that the contract will start with an initial purchase of 15 units over the course of 18 months. The contract also includes an option to purchase an additional 15 units over 18 months. In the release, the company said that if a minimum of 15 units are purchased, the purchaser will receive a perpetual license for the Turkish market.

TRNX will receive an upfront payment of $3.75 million for each gasification unit purchased. Following the initial purchase, an additional $1.75 million will be paid per unit under a 10-year maintenance contract. Taronis Technologies said that it wi also receive a 3% royalty on all gas produced.

If all 30 units are purchased, the total value of the contract would be $165 million plus royalties. The company also said that in order to meet demand in Turkey, about 75 gasification units would be needed. So, further purchase agreements may be down the line.",2019-07-26
