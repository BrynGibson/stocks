As someone who works retail Golden star for them.  In addition they started grouping product together by price and style and brand helping customers spend more $$$.

Also Avita has many patents that seem to predate their one competitor, renovacare.  Additionally renovacare stock price is way over inflated and it does not seem to have even started clinical trials with proper controls, and this seems to be a requirement for Pre Market Approval by the FDA.   Furthermore, the price of Avita Medical Devices is just leaving multiple year low and has been trading approximately horizontal for a while, seems to be a perfect time to jump in. 

I have one question about a source that I cant seem to find right off the bat, relating to what you said here;

Only 49.1mm executed on the contract total of $104.8mm. Leaving a remaining balance to be executed of $55.7mm. Their most recent previous filings, conference calls, and press releases all have indicated that they are pushing a lot of funds towards making sure that they can support the demand when FDA approval comes. They have said many times that BARDA will be stockpiling their RECELL devices through that contract upon FDA approval. In fact, they just acquired a manufacturing facility in California to make this happen. I encourage you guys to read their recent filings, press releases, and conference call.
