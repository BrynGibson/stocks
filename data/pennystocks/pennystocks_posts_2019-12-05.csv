5,Stein Mart SMRT$,e6jjw1,Derp2638,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e6jjw1/stein_mart_smrt/,1,9," I think this will start trending upwards after the holidays similar to two years ago where the stock went from 1.6 to IIRC almost to 4 dollars. 

They added a brand new department being jewelry and it’s in 50 of their 250 stores

If they make 40k profit of each store that has jewelry in it, that’s 2 million.  However, I’m thinking 2.5 million which is 555 dollars profit a day off the jewelry section.  This doesn’t count online sales. Which I think could be from 100k-500k. 

Last quarter they also added a kids section

The kids section will now be full stocked unlike last quarter. This is really good. A lot of the boys stuff was missing IIRC.  Star Wars + Disney brands.  This makes outlook better.  

Expenses on the conference call they said would be expected to be less. When talking about sales and comparing to last year they basically flat to small growth. However, I think jewelry + kids section will offer a big impact as well as expenses being less than last years q4. 

Things are looking up they just need to really push sales this quarter. 

Currently they are trading at 75 cents. I’m just letting all of you guys know about it so you can get in early before it starts rising.",2019-12-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e6jjw1/stein_mart_smrt/
