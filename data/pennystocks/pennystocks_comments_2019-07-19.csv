If I had 2 hours I couldn't fully tell you how stupid and poorly managed this company is. Which is why it will be chased by bears until it finally belly's up or sells out. People know the management will continually lie, cheat and deceive until there are no buyers left. Just part of their business model at this point. 

Do not average down under any circumstance. 

If you are up, sell immediately and dont look back. This is not a stock to bag hold. Even if there is a catalyst right around the corner, people have collectively lost MILLIONS in very similar situations in the not so distant past.",2019-07-19

 Often they are extremely hard to borrow, and if they are borrowable at all they are expensive to borrow.

One of the factor is liquidity. Often in these types of stocks liquidity dries up very quickly and if you are attempting to exit your position your orders alone will significantly move the price against you. 

 So you'll need to look out for that as well. Try to gauge your paper trading as if you will less 20% of the volume to mimic the liquidity premium

 Also obviously don't forget to record your paper trading results by taking the bid or offer for your security when you are paper trading. Not just the mid-price. The bid/offer spread on these names can be very wide and catch you out in real life trading",2019-07-19

    I’ve also been labeled a pumper simply for bringing stocks to everyone’s attention. I never intend for anyone to buy unless they’ve done their own research.  I’ll post some links sometimes and such to help folks but I can’t hold everyone’s hand all the way through a buy. And guess what. Sometimes I’m wrong. Go figure. Just is what it is. But when you are dead on right and it works out like this one m. Boy does it feel good.

That this thing is running hard and sharing his excitement.  How many bad picks do we have to sweat through to get one good, solid heavy runner. We nickel and dime our way up and down and finally get a huge win. What’s wrong with blowing your horn a little bit?? I agree with him too. This thing ain’t done by a long shot. You could easily double or triple a buy in right now.

70,Bubbs77,eu9r4hb,/r/pennystocks/comments/cfch49/ttcm_still_early_to_get_in/eu9r4hb/,1,"  I think one thing I have learned in OTC in the past year is every Penney stock gets pumped at some point. That doesn’t mean every company is illegitimate.  In fact the more legitimate a company the easier it is on pumpers to pump it. What’s hard is when a bonafide pumper has to fabricate catalyst or, pump catalyst  that would otherwise be Neutral news. But when a company has real news, real potiential, and a real business plan, it’s way easier for pumpers since they don’t have to make up crap.
  
   Unfortunately on OTC, pumpers pump every single stock. A company with potiential spikes up.  Then the dump happens even if the company is decent and the real investors are stuck with the bag until the SP slowly rebounds. (If the company is  good enough). 

    I see why Reverse splits happen to get companies out of OTC land. OTC can be brutal. But to play in OTC land you have to play by the rules of OTC land. Pumps happen. Get in front, ride it up. Take profits and accumulate free shares. Sell out before the dump. Keep a position or sell  out all together. But pumpers gonna Pump and people’s gonna dump. Get that nailed down and you can make some money and even keep some nice positions in legitimate companies for free.",2019-07-19
