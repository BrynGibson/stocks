27,What occured with Salm10 would be classified as a witch-hunt and should be taken seriously in forging new rules for this sub.,gjjx6n,BedfastDuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjjx6n/what_occured_with_salm10_would_be_classified_as_a/,1,96,"People rallying troops because the guy was a pumper is not cool. We collectively as a sub are pumpers, with some of us successfully being dumpers and some being bag holders (see TRNX back in July of last year, IBIO in Feb/March of this year, UAVS, MVIS, the list goes on). Some people sought out salm10 specifically to expose him as a pumper and to harass him on his stocktwits profile, which is considered a witch-hunt. This sub does not have antiwitch-hunting rules and in the interest of some people getting upset because they hopped on the wrong hype train, this absolutely needs to change. Moderators need to consider a couple new rules, including antiwitch-hunt as well as removal of posts that are not discussing stocks specifically. I know it would be rather difficult to moderate, especially with the large influx of new investors, however it is to both help protect people as well as help people learn DD.

Example: ""Salm11 said on stocktwits that TOPS is going to hit $500 by the end of the month.🚀"" with the post being tagged as DD. This post would be removed, as it is more of a promotion of Salm11 and has little to add to the conversation of the stock itself. If the user posted ""TOPS is going to hit $500"" this changes the subject to be more about TOPS and saves Salm11 from being burnt at the stake when this doesn't happen. Comments underneath may discuss Salm11 and his thoughts on the stock, but should be considered civil.

In the end, people are here to make money, not to bash one another's methods of doing so. Please treat each other, as well as people who are not members of this sub who are voicing their opinion on stocktwits, with respect.",2020-05-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjjx6n/what_occured_with_salm10_would_be_classified_as_a/

I'm not posting DD, but I'll post plays if you've done your DD and want to test the water.

Tues is going to pop soon. The play... buy in low 30s, this should go up to mid 40s soon. I'll set limit sell at .44 and reenter at 40 if market allows. If there isn't movement until Thursday next week, I'll see if i can break even and sell all. I say this based on the charts for the past few days and the fact that TUES financials is not pointing to bankruptcy. Risk level... medium high. 

Note: do not hold pennystocks long time. Sell and lock gains asap.


JOB. Hiring practices will change and this company will rise soon. In at 30 and 28 this morning, but don't expect much from this until 2, 3 weeks from now. I wont lose bc support is around .30. Check this out and buy a few just to have it under your radar. Risk... very high.

Note: don't blindly buy bottomed out stocks bc it could go bankrupt. 

NXTD... this is being recycled from .40 to .54, so if you want good gains.... buy in at .40 and cash out when content. However, one of these days, it will fly beyond .54 to mid 70s. My play? Sell half at .52 to .54, and  leave half to rise. Risk? Intermediate.  This gets some love.

Note: if you have a plan, stick to it. Do not fomo.

BNGO. the juiciest of them all. Go do your own DD for this and you'll see that it's been sitting on good news. No major spikes so far. It needs volume to fly. Play? Get in low 40s and cash high 60s. If this picks up momentum, i can it breaking a dollar by mid June. 

Note: do your DD and use others as guide. Do not trust blindly.


I'll check out PHUN as well... no holdings there bc action is slow for price range. 

All these are speculations based on charts and activities. Let's no use the term PND... I'm not posting fake articles and news... but i am bringing awareness to these dormant stocks. Best of luck.

I’ve got a tiny account. $200ish. 

I’m new to trading and have been watching/following a ton of people but what I see is mostly day trading. I can’t really do that because my account is below $25k. 

So my idea is to let all my funds settle, switch to a cash account. Then divide the money I have by 5 (days of the market week). Then only use that money for trading. In theory after a few days I’d always have money settling and available to use while other is settling and that days amount is being used.

What does this mean guys / gals? The beginning of the 3rd paragraph talks about the meeting on May 15, 2020, then mentions the possible issuance of common stock shares. HELP.

""On March 11, 2020, Genius Brands International, Inc. (the “Company”) and certain accredited investors (each an “Investor” and collectively, the “Investors”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue (1) Senior Secured Convertible Notes to the Investors in the aggregate principal amount of $13,750,000 (each, a “Note” and collectively, the “Notes”) and $11,000,000 funding amount (reflecting an original issue discount of $2,750,000) and (2) warrants to purchase 65,476,190 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), exercisable for a period of five years at an initial exercise price of $0.26 per share (each a “Warrant” and collectively, the “Warrants”), for consideration consisting of (i) a cash payment of $7,000,000, and (ii) full recourse cash secured promissory notes payable by the Investors to the Company (each, an “Investor Note” and collectively, the “Investor Notes”) in the principal amount of $4,000,000 (the “Investor Notes Principal”) (collectively, the “Financing”). Andy Heyward, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, participated as an Investor and invested $1,000,000 in connection with the Financing, all of which will be paid at the closing and not pursuant to an Investor Note.

The closing of the sale and issuance of the Notes, the Warrants and the Placement Agent Warrants described below is expected to occur on or before March 16, 2020 (the “Closing Date”). The maturity date of the Notes is September 30, 2021 and the maturity date of the Investor Notes is March 11, 2060.

The SPA contains certain representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for similar transactions. In addition, the Company agreed to the following additional covenants including, but not limited to: (i) the Company shall hold a stockholder meeting (the “Stockholder Meeting”), by no later than May 15, 2020, to approve the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Notes and pursuant to the terms of the SPA for the purposes of compliance with the stockholder approval rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Stockholder Approval”) and the Company will be obligated to continue to seek Stockholder Approval every 90 days until such approval is obtained, (ii) until the date that the Notes are no longer outstanding, the Company will not issue, offer, sell or grant any equity or equity-linked security, subject to certain limited exceptions described in the SPA, unless (A) Stockholder Approval has been obtained prior thereto and (B) (i) at least 75% of the gross proceeds in excess of the first $2,000,000 of gross proceeds of all subsequent Financings consummated prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date are first applied to the redemption of the Notes (pro-rata based on an Investor’s Purchase Price which redemption may be waiver by an Investor and it will not increase the pro-rata percentage of any other Investors) or (ii) at least 75% of the gross proceeds of any such subsequent placement consummated after the six month anniversary of the Closing Date are first applied to the redemption of the Notes (pro-rata), (iii) the Company shall use its best efforts to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreements executed by the Company and the stockholders who hold in the aggregate approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock which require that such stockholders vote in favor of the proposals voted on at the Stockholder Meeting, and (iv) promptly securing the listing of certain shares issuable pursuant to the transaction documents and maintaining the listing of the shares of Common Stock on an eligible market.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Notes and the Warrants, the Company agreed that the following will apply or become effective only following Stockholder Approval: (1) the conversion price of the Notes shall be reduced to $0.21 per share and may be further reduced to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company, (2) the exercise price of the Warrants shall be immediately reduced to $0.21 per share and may be further reduced to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company, (3) the Notes and Warrants shall each have full ratchet anti-dilution protection for subsequent financings (subject to certain exceptions), (4) existing warrant holders that are participating in the Financing (representing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,715,229 shares of Company Common Stock) will have their existing warrants’ exercise prices reduced to $0.21 and (5) the investors shall have a most favored nations right which provides that if the Company enters into a subsequent financing, then the Investors (together with their affiliates) at their sole discretion shall have the ability to exchange their Notes on a $1 for $1 basis into securities issued in the new transaction. Additionally, in the event that any warrants or options (or any similar security or right) issued in a subsequent financing include any terms more favorable to the holders thereof (less favorable to the Company) than the terms of the Warrants, the Warrants shall be automatically amended to include such more favorable terms.""

Researching some unrelated stocks, I came across a couple of pieces on this company (Sun Kissed Industries Inc).  From what I can see, they've been around since 1981 in one form or another.  Strange mixed bag of sectors.  Game development involving cryptocurrency, CBD marketplace and now they seem to be acquiring and trying to acquire other technology but not sure why.  


Two days ago, they acquired PushNote, a social media/marketing app that looks as if it's about to release an Android app (to go along with its iOS app - [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-note/id962393538](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-note/id962393538) \- this fits the description of what the app does, but I'm not 100% sure).  Press release(not an AP story) from them on the acquisition:  [https://apnews.com/PR%20Newswire/90d4b3a91ea6bfbd56868a6c17c32b43](https://apnews.com/PR%20Newswire/90d4b3a91ea6bfbd56868a6c17c32b43)   

&amp;#x200B;

Stock history is pretty much them bobbing near $0.01 a share for half a year.  Normally, I wouldn't even give something so low a second look but the acquisition and seemingly disconnected techs piqued my curiosity.  The upside of the stock price is any catalyst could cause an appreciable movement up from where it has been sitting for the last 6 months is a big % jump.  Downside, well .. it's a penny to sub-penny stock.  lol

Ticker: BCRX
Ticker's Most Recent Price: $6.10
Comment: Galidesivir - it is made by the publicly traded company BioCryst (BCRX) - there are other adenosine analogues but they didn't have anything noteworthy going on. It looks like BCRX is currently conducting and winding down a clinical study in Brazil, so results should be posted soon in the coming days/weeks (estimated study completion date is 5/31/21, and they started in April). 

This is just pure speculation and hypothesis, but looking at the molecular data for both drugs, I would think that Galidesivir is the more stable of the two since it can be stored at a higher temperature in powder form without denaturing. Also, it being easier to store would potentially make it the more popular of the two, especially in clinics where getting a medical grade freezer (that reaches -20 to -80C) may be hard. For reference, Galidesivir can be stored at +4C in powder form unlike Remdesivir which must be stored in the aforementioned range. Furthermore, if we look at the molecular weights of the two drugs, we see that Galidesivir is much lighter, and lower molecular weights are generally correlated with an increase in biological activity of the drug (better uptake). In layman's terms, I would think that the results from Galidesivir's study will be good, if not better than GILD's Remdesivir study. 

Financially, I think the company is doing very well, all things considered. While their most recent quarterly report did show a loss of $0.24/share they seem to have a good outlook. They do not expect COVID-19 to cause any delays with their drug development or commercial launch preparations, which is definitely reassuring. Currently, institutional ownership is very high at 89.65%, but I think this is good for those of us that get calls as this could drive the price of the stock up provided none of these institutions liquidate their positions. 

The Play: I'm thinking calls in the $7-10 range for 6/19 or 7/17. If you are a shares kinda person then I think that this company will be a great longterm hold (at least 6-12+ months) as they have other drugs in their pipeline that seem promising (one is being reviewed by the FDA and a decision should be made in Dec 2020/early 2021).

198,How to Properly Assess Risk when Investing in Penny Stocks.,gjqvgu,Cicero1982,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjqvgu/how_to_properly_assess_risk_when_investing_in/,10,13,"I will be making a more detailed tutorial on how to do micro-cap DD on a risk based model but there’s something I consider more urgent; particularly for new investors. NEVER INVEST IN A PENNY STOCK UNLESS YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING!

1. How long can they operate until they need to raise money? They will generally tell you how long they expect current operations to last at current levels on their 10-K’s, 10-Q’s, and DEF -14A’s. Find the last one and look for how long they expect to operate at current funding levels. Then estimate when they will raise money again. This will prevent bag holding due to offerings. REMEMBER! Just because they expect to operate at current funding levels until Q-1 2020 DOES NOT MEAN they will wait until that date to raise money! You can also estimate their current financial standing by reviewing their last 10k/10Q or DEF-14A and reviewing the offerings since that time. Should give you a good idea. Previous offerings can be reviewed in 8K’s.

2. Are there outstanding warrants? Check out their warrant history to see how many they issued, at what strike price, and how many were exercised. The left over warrants are a risk. If they are exercised you will experience a dramatic drop in security value. You can usually look for previous warrants both sold and exercised by sorting through their 8K’s. They are generally sold with public/private offerings. Researching this will prevent you from bag-holding due to the exercise of warrants. 

3. When must they be back in NASDAQ compliance? If out of compliance they face either delisting or a reverse split. No one will want to be around for either of those. You can find their drop dead compliance date on their DEF 14-A’s and sometimes in other forms. 8-K's usually announce delisting notices. If there is a shareholder meeting between now and the compliance date, there is usually a vote on the R/S. If that is the case you know you are at least safe until the shareholder meeting. If that is not the case you must attempt to estimate if they plan a R/S in the immediate future. This will prevent you from bag-holding on a surprise R/S. Remember they need to be above $1.00 for 10 days to a month (depending on the circumstance) to regain compliance. 

4. What are their expected catalysts? What good news are you expecting and when will it explode? This will help you get in before the pop. You can estimate this by reviewing their last PR 8K’s, and their last 10-K’s or 10-Q. You can get some good ideas by asking folks in forums with some business sense. 

5. Are institutions increasing their investment or decreasing their investment in the penny stock? This one is obvious. Simply type the ticker into google next to the words “institutional investors.”

6. Are insiders buying or selling? Are they doing anything? Another obvious one. You can find total insider shares on the most recent DEF-14A. You need to ensure that the folks owning the company are buying more shares each year. If not there is likely a reason. You will also want to know how much of a stake insiders have in their own company. A CEO who owns but a few shares (relatively speaking) is likely holding out for better times. You can find insider buying simply by looking for their Form 4’s. 

7. You’re going to want to know the short volume, the short interest, and the naked short interest. Shorting presents both opportunities and risks for longs. Plenty of references on that in the link below.

There are a number of considerations for investing in pennies. At minimum you should know the above questions. [All of them can be answered using these tools](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/free-references-and-resources.html?m=1)

Full transparency- Fwiw - I’m new to it... got in yesterday &amp; more today...... now watching closely and feeling confident. Haven’t been able to access the CC notes yet. Was going to post this in Daily Discussion but it got a little large.... 

Little Quicknotes snapshot here and my opinions for why I am sticking around...

-US-Based Manufacturer completing deals for the military during a very difficult &amp; “nationalist” time ...

-Improved EBITDA , still negative but with backlog of orders totalling over $13.3million SO FAR it is obvious IMO that next EBITDA improves markedly

-Improved first quarter year-over-year growth (usually sucks first Q as stated)

-“Tier 1” customer still being discussed which bumped up revenues in Q1

-“reduction in non-cash stock compensation for the board of directors... “ = a responsible move by management during this time

-IMO : responsible use of an ATM (at-the-market offering) during the quarter... Where just $1.5million in stock issued and sold —- NOT a big deal and explains the shares we see hitting the float. (Look up the difference between an ATM offering &amp; convertible debt if you don’t know as this is “at the market” and so it’s way less damaging than notes...)

This is good for short, mid, and long term hold. I’m not going to go too deep in it as it is best to do your own DD and analysis. However, this is a great buy especially at .7 right now (9:24 AM MST).  It is also worth mentioning that In AH it went up to a .79-.8. I also linked below my chart analysis on its dips and uptrend (my reddit post yesterday).

Companies past: 
	Before the first half of of 2019 this stock was over 5.31. After a reverse split stock the shares were worth a high of 3.36 and a low of 1.46. As the news of Coronavirus hit their stock feel off very quickly dropping from 2.06 to .91 in a week. They continued to fall to their 52w low, .28 (wish I found this stock then). Overtime they have just bend gradually raising from .39 to it’s current .7 in a month without any big hype around it. 
	As for the company, they sold their patent for its spine silicone nitride in 2018 on a 10 year deal. 
Companies future: 
	Because of their past and the charts, it is easy to confidently say this company will continue to rise into at least the low ones in the upcoming months. They are currently looking for a way to use their technology in the COVID-19 scenario with rumored to be specialized mask. With the selling go their “highly successful” spinal implant, they were able to turn their attention to other means and are experimenting with their silicone nitrate solutions in many different areas such as technology as well. To add onto this, they claim to be one of a kind in their field cause they are the only people that are using silicone nitrate in used in such ways as themselves. 
	The company also has a high motivation to release PR soon and has said so themselves that they are determined to reach NASDAQ compliance again. 

Consensus: Short term: I am up 13% in less than a week. The company will continue to rise over time and with gained attention that exposure will be faster (target range 1.2++)
Mid term: It’ll still raise as PRs get announced and more news is released (target 1.8++)
Long term: This company is one major advancement away from being a standing company worth a lot more than just .7. With their technology they can very well change the way implants are done and how they perform, as well as them expanding their fields into other areas of the world such as aerospace, electronics, and many more.

I’ve noticed a higher support around 2.60 -2.75 after the news hit, although it may be a bit of a barrier at the $3 mark for the time being.

Given the strong ties to SARS and the usage of Ampligen in 2003, along with the go for trials, I expect this to reach $3.50 when news of trials actually happening are underway for fighting COVID-19, and then a strong pump before the results are released. If trials were a success, then it will skyrocket. If not, I hope you all sold before the news like we’re all supposed to but never do.

I’m in at $2.95, so I got in a bit too high, but I plan to hold throughout the research process or until I profit 15% @3.40. I just wanted to hear your insights. Best of luck lads and ladettes",2020-05-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjvkka/thoughts_on_aim/

He stood firm on his belief, even with all the haters. It totally got me thinking and I did my own DD. We are headed to the moon, seriously. 

Major insider trading going on right now, and Salm10 knew this. It’s not a dump. 

It’s no coincidence that “Salm10” says “this will do what I said.” And not even 10 minutes later, (SAM- System For Award Management Firm) purchased 180,000 shares, effectively shooting the price up by .5 cents in 1 second. For a penny stock, this is huge. 

Clearly there is insider trading going on, so I looked into. I’m firm on this, that’s why I’m not worried in the slightest with the recent dip. The company announced a R/S (against all odds, because they know exactly what they are holding- a gold mine). Effectively, this has tanked the stock today, they will buy their own shares back at a fraction of the cost, so that when it shoots up to the $1.06 it will hit, they stand to make millions. 

Is this legal? Definitely not. Does that mean we can’t also profit? Definitely not. 

Think about it people, they just paid off almost half their debt, have insane cash on hand, and reported ~150 million in revenue during a pandemic. 

I am not worried. I’m holding 6725 shares. Everyone who jumped shit will be disappointed af, when the CEOS who own the shares make millions, and you found out you sold for $100 profit.

Really simple to use and if you like to play penny stocks on the safer side then this might just be for you. To access it, click ""File"" then ""Make a copy"". You have to be logged into a gmail account to make a copy (I think).

Little explanation of how it works:

* Don't have to put in stock name but it's easier to see what you bought
* Put in the price you bought the stock
* Put in how many shares you bought
* It calculates the total price

* YOU PICK a price you'd like to sell the stock at
* It calculates how many shares you need to sell to cover your costs
* Shows you how many shares will be pure profit shares no matter what happens to the stock price after you've sold at your target price.

You can always put a stop loss or trailing stop loss as your safety net to potentially make more money or you can also use this method if you know you're a FOMO chaser and don't know when to sell haha.

Basically, I'm leaving the penny stock game. If you can relate to my reasoning, I suggest some do the same before you blow your children's college fund:

1. Main reason I'm leaving... is because I'm lazy. I don't want to do my own DD everyday.
2. And by the time somebody does it for you here, there's a chance it's too late or bad DD.
3. I usually gain whatever I just lost (and vice versa)
4. I got into penny stocks just to satisfy the itch of actively day-trading. But you have to be patient with a lot of penny stocks too. Like the ones Salm10 suggests (RIP). I was impatient and sold early in INO, IBIO, RTTR so I can chase the new headliner. (Just an FYI, I never blamed Salm10 or anyone else for my losses).
5. Being a minimalist. This one is dumb. But I hated having low % holdings all over my portfolio. So I would sell some pretty early if I thought they weren't going to go up anytime soon.

Shout out to  [u/TheBazaarTrades](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBazaarTrades/) and  [u/kirlandwater](https://www.reddit.com/user/kirlandwater/) for most of my gainz.

I lost a lot on MVIS, SBFM; but I gained on TTI, IZEA, CLIS. So I broke even. I can't complain. I was playing it safe. I only ""invested"" \*cough\* gambled what I was comfortable losing.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I had some beginner's luck here. I thought I could make a decent buck. But ultimately, I got cocky. It reminded me when I hit age 21, started going to casinos, and was winning there. I was beginning to think I could be a professional gambler until reality pimp slapped me. LOL!

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to everyone, and may you make profitable exits on GNUS/MARK-esque stocks!

&amp;#x200B;

fyi, if you blame other people for your losses, that's 1000% your fault. Don't trust others with your money. Would you ask a stranger on the street how you should invest your money? No?

At least, I notice it with all the stocks I currently hold- KTOV, IZEA, APHA, RTTR, ZOMB, BIOC, and TTNP. 

Of course, this could be the nature of some of the stocks I'm holding. I just wanted to discuss trading after a the market goes red. I theorize that there's a low volume due to fear of losses. The Wallstreet Journal published, ""U.S Stock Futures Wobble Ahead of Jobless Claims Data"". 

I read somewhere Warren Buffet said he would be bold and buy during these times of fear. Is there merit to this kind of thinking? It seems to me that if individuals invested in, let's say, the dips in petrol and airlines that they would make a killing when the virus either tapers off or there's a viable vaccine for it.

I'm just trying to learn a little more regarding the full gestalt of how the market leviathan operates and reacts to happenings. Some sectors are doing alright, however. I think biotech has been doing well as far as I can tell. Seems like everyone is banking on them finding a solid treatment for the virus.

But a bit has changed. Since then they had an offering (hence the dramatic from from 1.80s to 1.10s a few weeks back), to raise funds for FDA approval for their Hep B vaccine, which is more effective than any current alternative. They now have the $50m in cash they need for stuff like that, and the buyout was bought out by a number of big players like Perceptive.

They're waiting on approval for Government funding IIRC too, so news of that should help it further up soon.

For me, it’s about 85% charts and technical analysis and 15% news. News can sometimes be a catalyst to launch prices out of consolidation patterns.  For instance, during my bioc trade, I did look for info on their earnings report. 

The first trade I took when coming back to penny stocks was UAVS because my friend irl said amazon was partnering with them. After buying in I looked at the company with eleven fucking employees headquartered in a damn trailer and was immediately reminded that penny stocks haven’t changed since I first traded them like nine years ago. Amazon, IF ANYTHING, would straight up buy that company without a second thought and wouldn’t even notice that amount of money missing from their budget. 

So I’m just curious what you guys think. Just being honest I usually scroll through all the rumor or news posts without too much thought.

I was the one who introduced @Salm10 to this sub and it was really just meant for discussion and thoughts on his picks. He’s a friendly guy who literally just posts honest predictions on stocktwits and has helped a lot of people for free. 

Some might argue that he is a pumper, and that it’s not really “free”. Or that he is gaining something on top of all of this, but the truth is that wasn’t his intent. Before I posted him in this sub, he had barely 2k followers and would get maybe 10 likes per comment, sometimes none. Hardly anyone acted on his calls. Now he has more than 7k active followers with everybody watching and criticizing his every breath. His “pumping” is not pumping. He just has such a large following now that every stock he mentions gets a small burst from people following his call. 

Welp. There’s that gone. He’s been bullied off stocktwits, congrats. I probably should’ve kept him to myself. Lesson learned.

472,UAVS + eCommerce = $$$,gjdq0a,yrall,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjdq0a/uavs_ecommerce/,1,15,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ageagle-receives-purchase-orders-manufacture-123010268.html

I bought in after news broke that they were expanding into eCommerce drone making and had received purchase orders from a major eCommerce company. Some people are guessing that Amazon is that eCommerce company. Makes sense that Amazon is currently investing in delivery drones bc Amazon announced that they were spending all of their profits from 1Q to make their employees safer from COVID. Utilizing drones to deliver packages will help reduce COVID risk for Amazon employees. 

This week, UAVS sold $6M in shares in a direct offering to some German investment firm called Alpha Capital Anstalt (who was already a major shareholder) to raise capital to fund their expansion into delivery drones. When the news broke that they were selling $6M in shares at $1.06 the stock dropped from over $2 to around $1. I bought in more heavily once it dropped following stock offering. It’s been slowly climbing since then, but I believe it’s about to skyrocket leading up to their 1Q earnings date. Once they announce their earnings date, it’ll end up on people’s radars who do earnings plays and volume will increase as earnings date approaches and drive up the price of the stock. Once they announce who the eCommerce company is, I think it will go up again.

Anyone have any theories as to who the eCommerce company ordering drones from UAVS is?
