Portfolio investors buy and sell within a diversified basket of stocks. Effort is a lot less, but volatility at portfolio level is lesser than if trading individual stock trends.

Example : https://spotalpha.com/us/portfolios/small-cap

Trend signal investors typically buy and hold for a few weeks.

Example : https://spotalpha.com/us/trends/portfolio-trends

Buy-and-hold investors keep accumulating with very little churn and hold for several weeks to a few years.

Example : https://spotalpha.com/us/ratings/dashboard

Intra-day traders / scalpers mostly close positions before session close, as they are highly leveraged and don't want overnight risk.

Speculators (example buy side options traders) take significantly more risk (&gt; 50%) and return (&gt; 100%) on each position.

Return to Compliance

After receiving a deficiency notice, a company has 180 calendar days to return to compliance. A company warned about its shares' minimum bid price must achieve a closing price of $1 or more for 10 consecutive trading days during this period. Report-filing offenders must file the required reports, and then must file subsequent reports by the due dates.

Additional Grace Period

If a company with a minimum market value of $1 million in shares held by non-affiliates satisfies the other listing requirements, it may receive a second ""cure period"" of 180 calendar days. To receive this, the company must notify Nasdaq of its intent to correct the deficiency. Nasdaq may exercise its discretion in determining whether it believes the company can cure the deficiency.

Delisting Letter

If a company fails to comply with the minimum requirements during the first grace period or any second grace period, Nasdaq will issue a delisting letter to the company. As with the deficiency notice, the company must notify the investing public of the delisting letter within four business days, by filing an 8-K with the SEC. The company then can appeal its delisting to the hearings panel.

Hearing Process

Once a company receives a Nasdaq delisting letter, it has seven days to formally request a hearing. This request effectively halts the delisting process until the panel renders a decision. At the hearing, the company must present a detailed plan to regain and maintain listing compliance. The panel may consider the company‚Äôs financial strength, general market overview and historical pricing.

Delisting and Appeals

After the seven days, Nasdaq delists a company. First it suspends trading of its security, then it finalizes the delisting. If a company appeals but the panel rules in favor of delisting, Nasdaq gives the company 15 more days to further appeal to Nasdaq or in federal court, but it begins final delisting procedures.",2020-01-30
