1,nonameattachedforme,dzhbagf,/r/pennystocks/comments/8lovg6/acbto_question/dzhbagf/,1,"ACB isn’t really a penny stock, first of all. It is several dollars a share and a multi-billion dollar company with international reach.

That said though, yes, your friend is losing his or her touch. Aurora is on its own level only with Canopy. Canopy is a well-executed company with incredible management. They have beautiful brands, a great strong reach, and they have a ton invested throughout the marijuana ecosystem from health sciences to technology.

Aurora, on the other hand, has been playing catch up to Canopy. In pursuit of reaching their level, they have taken on two of the top three most expensive acquisitions. Firstly, they purchased Cannimed for $1.1B which was a drastic increase over their initial offer and the ongoing market price. Next they’re purchasing MedReleaf for $3.2B, a 34% premium over their market price.

Canopy has still beat them to most major supply deals. Canopy beat them to a NYSE listing. Canopy, frankly, seems to be leading in most areas by executing flawlessly. Aurora is constantly diluting their shareholders through expensive acquisitions.

That’s my two cents. Many will disagree with me (especially from the weedstocks community) but I stand by it. Aurora probably will see nice growth over the next couple months but they’ll still shadow to Canopy.",2018-05-24

With Netflix, their expenses were relatively set. Especially after the shift from DVDs to streaming.

For example, (these are obviously fake numbers) if Netflix had one user but paid $100 million for their video library, obviously they were losing money. But once they hit ~1 million subscribers, they were about breaking even. And as subscribers grew, they could expand their library while still making a profit.

With Netflix, everyone is sharing from the same pool of content.

But with MoviePass, right now at least, if they have one subscriber paying $8/month and he sees one movie (at a theater with no deal with MoviePass) they are losing money. If they have a million subscribers they are losing even more money. There isn't a shared pool. Everyone sees their own individual films.

And, if they have subscribers who pay the $10 rate and go to a movie 5-10 times a month (or more) they are losing even more money.

As I see it, at this point, the only way they can make money is if they get subscribers who keep the service but stop going to movies. What percentage of users are going to do that?

Unless they start making more deals with theaters (if they can) and figure out other revenue sources (which it appears they are working on), they are going to bleed money, dilute and the SP will drop.

All that said, I think this certainly does have potential. But I wouldn't buy in now. In likelihood, you are going to lose money, at least short-term..",2018-05-24

Got back in under $1.00 share. \(Effectively .01\) which is a bargain for this stock.
