5,BPMX EMA TA,7unqye,DrDewclaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7unqye/bpmx_ema_ta/,31,16,"looking at BPMX over the past 365/1D, the 20D and 50D EMA's came into a squeeze, with the price reacting to bounce out between the two. Today was the first day where the price broke above the 20D/50D EMA, and it closed about .04 above the 50D EMA. Some stocks when they break above the 50D EMA it acts like a new support for further price action. If the price climbs tomorrow I'd say it's safe to hold until it reachs the 200D EMA, where I would most likely sell. If it bounces south off the 200D it was a good sell, if it bounces above then you're still looking at a massive 50% gain if you were to get in right now and sell at the 200D EMA (.2858). Additionally There was a lot of volume at market open and also market close, and we saw a ~.03 price gap up right before market close. People are watching this stock for sure, and with a potential new support at the 50D EMA (.14) I think pending tomorrows opening performance I would hold onto until aforementioned price levels. Possible stoploss at .23 after it breaks .25 and let it ride, if it breaks the 200D EMA(.28) I'd guess it'd be a really high price spike and I'd sell the hype at like .34. Or it could just go to shit also, who knows, but thats my TA on it based on EMA's. Chart https://imgur.com/a/IKEMm

About Pulse Evolution Corporation

The Company is a recognized pioneer and leading developer of hyper-realistic digital humans for entertainment, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.  Pulse is most popularly known for producing the animated digital human likeness of the late Michael Jackson that appeared in a live performance of the Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014, seen by more than 11 million television viewers and generating more than 2,400 news articles and 98 billion Internet impressions.  

Founded by the world's leading executives and producers of photorealistic digital humans, such as the lead character from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and the concert experience ""Tupac at Coachella', Pulse Evolution is currently developing computer-generated digital humans for entertainment and media applications, such as holographic live performances, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.  The Company has a multi-year revenue share agreement with the Estate of Michael Jackson, and the Company also counts the estates of Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as significant shareholders.

The Company sees digital humans emerging as ubiquitous in society, culture and industry.  They will not only perform for audiences on stage or in film, but they will also represent individual consumers as digital likeness avatars, in realistic and fantasy form, appearing and interacting on the consumer's behalf in electronic and mobile communication, social media, video games and virtual reality.  Future digital humans will provide a relatable human interface for artificial intelligence applications, 'thinking' machine systems that, through the Company's technology, will appear as realistic communicating humans in mobile devices, digital signage, classrooms and through lightweight wearable augmented reality glasses and virtual reality headsets.  The Company's long-term goal is to develop its technology beyond entertainment applications, ultimately supporting licensees and joint venture partners who are seeking to build the 'face' of artificial intelligence, to provide a human form to interactive artificially intelligent computer beings. 

Pulse has operations in Hobe Sound, Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada.
