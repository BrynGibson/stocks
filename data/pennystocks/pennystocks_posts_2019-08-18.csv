I get lots of PMs about how to top tick. When it comes to getting long, it's my guess. This post pertains to shorting exclusively. 

Around 3 years ago, my trades would look like this: https://imgur.com/BOfQa6I

My thought process was simple, short the resistance lines. At the time, it was only a slightly upgraded strategy from my previous one; shorting a breakdown. Prior to that, it was simply coping trades from those I thought had more knowledge than me. Turns out all these strategies were hopeless dead-ends. It wasn't because of my ""hope"" or determination, rather it was due to a lack of asking *why*. Why would a stock keep going above my resistance entry? Why would people buy here? 

Problem was, even when I had answers, the answers would be nothing but subjective interpretations of things I've already concluded. For example if I was going long: Why would a stock go up? My reason: Because it's a good buy. It's not going deep into *why* it would be a good buy, nor is it looking to *falsify* why. 

Imagine a scenario with a person you know. It could be with a person you know on the side, or maybe a friend. Let's say for instance, this scenario is what you'd perceive as ""negative."" Now if you ask *why* it was a negative, your first instinct is to look out for evidence proving why it is. At this point, I suggest a simple change in philosophy. Look out for evidence *why* the negative label on the scenario is wrong, rather than right. This is the basics on how to successfully grow on a strategy and break out.

Circling back into stocks. Top-ticking is almost entirely feel based. Meaning after so many years of seeing the same patterns over and over, I know what to expect on certain moves. While it's not a guarantee, I know the odds are in my favor. 

I get a slight annoyance with this forum, as many people on here preach their stock picks. Most people fall for things a middle schooler interested in stocks would fall for, stock picks and a lack of autonomous decision making. Watch your own trades back on a screen recording relentlessly. 1 hour a day isn't enough, make it at least 5 of just trying to pick out patterns in the recording. Actively falsify hypothesis you create about a movement. Overtime, this will propel you beyond the competition. 

Here are 4 recent trades that I either top ticked or came close to:

I watched the screen-captured recordings of all these trades individually several hours each. I won't go into too much detail what I look for, but the chart is maybe 10% of it. Create your own strategy and I'll work out for you in the long-run.

Happy trading! -

**ISIN:**  ***PTTD10AM0000***

*I'm long on Teixeira Duarte, just invested all I had on cash on it.*

**Teixeira Duarte, S.A.** is a Portuguese company that leads a large conglomerate with more than 10,000 workers, present in more than 18 countries, in 6 activity sectors.

Teixeira Duarte, S.A. was founded in 1921 and is listed at Euronext Lisbon since 1998, Being its shareholder majority of the Teixeira Duarte family.

Teixeira Duarte Group, which started as a construction company, managed, through  sustained growth in construction over decades, to progressively develop other activity sectors: Construction; Concessions and Services; Real Estate; Hospitality; Distribution and Automotive.

Throughout the years Teixeira Duarte become the second biggest Portuguese constructer (still is). In January 2014, it‚Äôs Market cap was over 600Millions, with a share price of 1,44‚Ç¨. It was part of the PSI20 (Portuguese major Index) for several years.

It‚Äôs main shareholders are the Teixeira Duarte family with 50.3% of total shares. This is a great indicator for the company, as the owners are motivated do their best with the company, the family only asset.

The foreign markets represent 75.3% of turnover, with Angola and Brazil being the highest contributors.  [https://imgur.com/vn8xaDS](https://imgur.com/vn8xaDS)

Now that we know a little bit about the company let‚Äôs take a look at it‚Äôs financials. Construction was 60% of the company turnover, followed by services (11.9%) and real estate (3.3%)

[https://imgur.com/8gU9PPj](https://imgur.com/8gU9PPj)

It's important to notice that TD is focusing it's business once again in Construction (from 48% turnover to 60%), it's core business and where it had more success.

1s Quarter Report (in Portuguese): [https://www.teixeiraduarte.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tdsa1trim2019.pdf](https://www.teixeiraduarte.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tdsa1trim2019.pdf)

Net asset of 1.92 Millions. EBITDA is 39M‚Ç¨. Turnover 210 Mils. Net result of 8 Mils ‚Ç¨.

TD has been lowering it‚Äôs debt since it was refinanced in 2017.

[https://imgur.com/ccZLDKI](https://imgur.com/ccZLDKI)

It‚Äôs share price is far away from it‚Äôs ATH in 2014, but there were some upsides in 2017 after the restructuration of debt and internal businesses. A good signal.

However, something really important happened in the last year.

One of TD major shareholder, Millenium BCP (BCP.LS), a Portuguese Bank, had over 10% of TD shares, mainly in it‚Äôs pension plans and funds. For the last year and a half, BCP was forced to restructure it's pension plans and has been dumping daily Millions of shares, causing the price to drop to these ridiculous amounts of under 0.10 cents per share.

[https://imgur.com/UCHpCYX](https://imgur.com/UCHpCYX)

BCP has just finished dumping pretty much all shares. In 26/06/2019 it had less than 2% and now has even less than that. Just take a look at the price drop between April 2018 and now. This was only because of the shares dumped and made the company trade at half it's real value!

&amp;#x200B;

The future is brighter than the last couple years. TD success is linked with construction, which is just accelerating in Portugal (3.7% in 1st quarter). It is expected to grow in 2019 and 2020 with real estate prices going up and the need for new construction.

TD is valued at 0.106 per share atm, with a P/E of 3.9 on quarter, or 2.0 on last year, and a Market cap of 44Ms. This is ridiculously low for a company like Teixeira Duarte, with assets all over the world and financial results justifying at least 100Ms in Market cap. (as you see in the graphs above, the decline from 0.25 to 0.10 was abrupt and caused by BCP dumping).

Furthermore, 1st Semester results will come out on 28th of August and I‚Äôm sure that will be the beginning of the share valuation again. They have a lot of plans going on üòâ

Now, the personal part‚Ä¶ and the most juicy

I‚Äôm a real estate agent in Portugal and I regularly work with Teixeira Duarte. I know it is a solid company, and most important, I know what they have up in their sleeves for 2021.

In 2021 Teixeira Duarte will celebrate it‚Äôs 100th birthday, and they wanna do it big. They have major construction ventures programmed to finish by 2021. Including it‚Äôs special baby, Factory 1921. This is an old factory that was started in the same year as Teixeira Duarte, 1921. They are making a major venture there, small information is ready to the public ([https://fabrica1921.pt/](https://fabrica1921.pt/)) but I‚Äôve had the pleasure of working in the project as a Real Estate Agent, and trust me, it will be big and profitable. I can't disclosure much because of confidentiality, but it's sold out and it isn't even built, the results will be amazing this semester.

It also has a project with the Chinese in Lisbon which already gave them 31.1Mils this year and is projected to earn even more once they finish the venture (comes in the results from this semester).

Appart from that, Brazil has finally had some benefits in construction and should be an improving market in the next 2 years. Angola is the major ‚Äúincognita‚Äù.

If we take a look at the only bigger Portuguese construction company, Mota-Engil (ELI: EGL), it‚Äôs clear that the construction market is full of ups and downs. Well, guess what, both companys, TD and EGL, are in , or near, their minimums. It‚Äôs time for them to grow, and I‚Äôm sure Teixeira Duarte will grow in the next 1 and a half year.

Following this, my advise is: Buy all you can between 0.09 and 0.15. I‚Äôm 99.9% sure it will go to AT LEAST 0.25 in the next 2 years. I‚Äôm aiming for 0.50cents per share, or a 200Millions Market Cap. I'm not sure it's in place to reach 600Mils market cap again in the near future, but i'm damm sure it will grow in the next 2 years.

**TL.DR: This company is worth, at this exact moment, over 100Ms. Yet it is valued at 44 Mils due to previous bad years (mainly due to Angola losses), and mainly the BCP bank dumping all it‚Äôs shares (over 12%) in the last 15 months. Teixeira Duarte was formed in 1921 and is planning to celebrate it‚Äôs 100th anniversary with a great year, with all ventures aiming to end at that time, most of them already sold even before construction started. It will be worth 200Mils (0.50‚Ç¨ per share) in 2 years. BUY NOWWWW.**",2019-08-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cs34e6/dd_on_solid_investment_200_return/
