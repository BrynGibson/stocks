116,user_dan,dsclhu4,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ny9xz/is_360_blockchain_worth_it/dsclhu4/,1,"I think crypto stock rally is not over. We will see higher prices, but..

The crypto stocks on coming to terms with the highs that were made in Dec. The folks that bought up will sell at every opportunity they get. The resolution is to shake those people out over time with price drifting lower (really a pullback). See $MGTI after it hit it's highs in Aug.. textbook example. Note, this is not a prediction, but guidance on where I initiated and place stops.

I am bullish on $MGTI, but at this price, I would hold (I am from 1.70-ish). If it drifts to the 3s or high 2s, I would recommend initiating a position or adding. If it does not reach the 3s, go on to the next ticker in this raging bull market!

$BTCS is a little tough. It has a lot of support at .12, but it is hanging on to a consolidating range above it. A similar thing happened a couple of months ago when .0785 was a big support level. It ended up dipping to .0785 and bouncing hard. It technically IS at a good spot to open a position, but you have to be ok with a .11 stop.

$DIGAF and $GLNNF are worth a look too.",2018-01-03

Also if you want one to buy by end of day get SELB. They just got FDA approval for drug blah blah shares went down dip is lower than when I bought in at 9.07 but can foresee similar gains.
