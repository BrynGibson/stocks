It sounds suspiciously like you're asking someone to literally give you their conclusion of the company on whether it's a ""good investment"" or not based on the financial report instead of you doing it yourself. 

If, on the off chance, you're actually asking someone to help you learn *how to analyze* a financial report, then that's something you definitely need to go to college for. Take finance classes and you will learn.",2019-03-31
