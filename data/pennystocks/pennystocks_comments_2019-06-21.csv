Until the SEC and shareholders make it effective, there is still risk. Given where it’s at, I find it to be a bargain assuming all things work out. I don’t intend to hold as a long term investment, as I typically day trade and only swing longterm when I see huge gain potential. 

The run to .36 had a pretty parabolic curve both there and back, so a dead cat bounce play may be at hand or another run. Given its history, I’d expect a partial retracement but not to where it was at .36 in the next few days or week. I would love to be wrong on that, but I predicate my strategies on previous patterns, check the known financials to attempt to evaluate it’s “true value,” and then confirm/play that against the TA real-time.",2019-06-21

50,justshellit,ervrcqs,/r/pennystocks/comments/c36ypr/simple_questions_june_21_2019/ervrcqs/,1,"Alright.  There's two ways of being successful in Penny stocks.  The first is to do a ton of due diligence and hope and pray that the company you pick and invest in makes it big.  99.99999% of them won't.   It's nearly impossible to pick a needle out of the haystack.  ""but they said they have a cure for cancer!""  They all have something.... These companies put it all on the line.   They literally will lie their way to getting investments.  They will fudge numbers, over exaggerate gains, lie about profits, you name it.  Picking one out of the hat is a recipe to losing your money fast.  

The second is to ride the pumps and take the 4-5% gains.  Over time you will create a decent size portfolio which allows your 5% gains to mean something.  You can usually take 4-5% daily if you use a cash account or don't have to abide the PDT rule.   Ustocktrade and suretrader don't have the PDT rule. The side bar on the right  has a really good sub reddit that breaks down a ton of strategies. 

If you are asking more along the lines of how you get started, download Robin Hood or webull.  Put some money in and play around.  As you get better, move up to more professional brokers to match the resources you want or need.",2019-06-21

Sometimes penny stocks perform well on weekends and sometimes on weekdays. As you can see different people have shared different opinions. So I believe it sorely depends on your stock.
