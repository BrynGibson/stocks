2,Flexpoint sensors FLXT,edrw18,thebullishbearish,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/edrw18/flexpoint_sensors_flxt/,1,7,"Just received 100k payment for licensing of its technology, part of a 500k multi year deal. 

While the stock from looks of the long term chart has been quite unexciting and has 100m shares outstanding, seems like a decent spect 8c. 

I dont know of many 8c companies receiving 100k payments for use of its technology. The company already has a patent on its sensor technology. 

Flxt only has a few hundred k in cash but seems to have several irons in the fire for their technology including battery and air bag sensors. Also new self driving cars will require more sensors than previous ones to make sure people drive them from the backseat lol. 

Is releasing white paper in early 2020 on their new sensors, to me seems like a decent spec play.
