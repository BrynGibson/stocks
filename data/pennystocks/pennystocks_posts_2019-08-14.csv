Many messaging me were wondering how I traded AKTX. I shorted it initially on it's consistent stuffing into 2.50. Offer was showing hidden size, but I figured they'd pull it since they could get a better fill; squeezing people out. Opening average was 2.42, but with small size. The real size came after: they pulled the hidden offer at 2.50 and it popped to the 2.70's. Then I hammered it short, and stupidly covered all my shares on the bid too early, instead of taking partial outs.

&gt; Based on my in-depth analysis my projection is that Investview soon could be reporting the financials, including the revenue growth rates and profit margins to support a market cap of $1 billion and a share price of $0.37 by end of 2020.  The company now has the products and the infrastructure to support a six-fold increase to 100,000 or more distributors. Assuming that the company produces the financial results to support a billion-dollar market cap by the middle of 2020, the value of Investview could potentially get to $5 billion and a share price of $1.50 by 2025.  Should subsidiaries SAFETek and Safe Management gain traction over the next few months the share price could go to a new two year high by the end of 2019. ",2019-08-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cq9hys/big_news_out_for_invu_signs_letter_of_intent_loi/

(OTCQB:[KULR](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/kulr)) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management technologies, today reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019.  


Second Quarter 2019 and Subsequent Highlights:

* Announced agreement with Lockheed Martin, a leading aerospace and defense company, to provide its purpose-built phase change (PCM) heat sink for a confidential aerospace application.
* Partnered with Centre De Technologies Avancées, an industry leading vehicle research organization, to implement KULR's advanced LYRA ISC battery testing device to improve electric vehicle battery safety.
* Presented several of the Company's breakthrough battery safety and testing products at the Advanced Automotive Battery Conference in San Diego, California on June 24-27, 2019
* Conducted due diligence on the previously announced Securities Purchase Agreement of TECHTOM Co., Ltd., a Japanese limited liability company. After thorough review, the Company has decided against the acquisition.
* Announced ticker symbol change from ""KUTG"" to ""KULR"" on the OTCQB exchange operated by OTC Markets Group.
* Engaged MZ Group to lead a comprehensive strategic investor relations and shareholder communications program across all key markets.

Second Quarter 2019 Financial Summary

* Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $56,310, compared to revenue of $171,091 in the same year-ago quarter. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of product sales, as well as the decrease in service contract completions during the second quarter of 2019.
* Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was $27,760, or 49.3% of revenues, compared to gross profit of $137,621, or 80.4% of revenues, for the same year-ago quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales of higher margin products as compared to the 2018 period.
* Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, were $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $0.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to decreased professional fees of approximately $41,000 resulting from the termination of multiple consulting agreements and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increased travel expenses.
* Net loss in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $0.6 million, or $(0.01) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.6 million, or $(0.01) per share, in the same year-ago quarter.
* Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits were $0.1 million as of June 30, 2019, compared with $0.1 million as of March 31, 2019.

Management Commentary  


""In the second quarter of 2018, we made several meaningful strides towards leveraging our proven technology into several multi-billion-dollar commercial markets,"" said Michael Mo, Chief Executive Officer of KULR Technology Group. ""Today, I am pleased to report that we are currently engaged with more than 25 world-class companies across our target sectors, all of which are at various stages of testing and development.""

We strongly believe that we are positioned for a breakout year as we look to transition select developmental partnerships into volume production customers and look forward to long-term shareholder value creation as we continue to execute upon our goals,"" concluded Mo.

**Addition Brings Financial Services Suite of Products to Complement Company’s Current Telemedicine Offering**  


**Client Base Expands to Include Hospital Systems, Clinics, and Doctor Networks in Addition to Long Term Care Providers**

LAS VEGAS, Aug. 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexteligent Holdings, Inc. f/k/a Efftec International, Inc. (OTC:EFFI) (“Nexteligent”), an aggregator of healthcare professional services and technology firms, is pleased to announce that it has acquired the assets of Revenue Maximization Group (“RMG”), a national provider of revenue cycle  management solutions, for a combination of cash and stock.  This acquisition complements the previous acquisition in 2018 of TeleCare Partners Group by Nexteligent which launched its Telemedicine division.   

TeleCare Partners Group and Revenue Maximization Group will operate under the Nexteligent umbrella as interdependent entities that will collaborate to contain costs, improve productivity, and enhance the quality of medical encounters for hospital systems, clinics, long term care institutions, and doctor groups.  

“We are extremely pleased to welcome RMG’s CEO, Stuart Miller, into the Nexteligent family.  His talent as an industry leader and the suite of revenue cycle services that RMG brings to Nexteligent makes this transaction an important lever for accelerating business development and new product innovations,” noted Nexteligent Chairman and CEO, Paul Cristiano.  “With the addition of RMG, we achieve a major milestone toward fulfilling our vision to be the preeminent aggregator of specialized healthcare organizations with strong value propositions and established niche positions in their space.”

Stuart Miller noted that the interdependency model that Nexteligent has created makes it highly attractive to specialists like RMG that seek new growth opportunities, access to capital, and cross selling capabilities. “I am confident that our ability to increase revenues, optimize operations, reduce costs, minimize denials, and seamlessly implement solutions from the front end to the back end of the revenue cycle chain for clients will be a major platform for new business development and product innovation,” said Mr. Miller. “Incorporating our suite of solutions into Nexteligent is a growth accelerator for both RMG and for our sister companies linked through the Nexteligent brand,” he added. 

Mr. Cristiano underscored that Nexteligent’s focus on the healthcare sector is driven by rapidly evolving demographics and market forces that demand innovation and new models for success. “If you keep on doing what you do, you will keep on getting what you get. Those companies that are able to serve the healthcare sector with meaningful creativity will be the leaders in their fields.  To this end, Nexteligent is a change agent. Our ability to quickly respond to industry trends and each client’s unique requirements makes us a valuable part of the healthcare delivery landscape,” he said. “This mindset is reflected in our name ‘Nexteligent.’ Our team is always thinking ahead of the curve.”

Mr. Cristiano concluded: “With the addition of exciting companies like RMG, we continue our trajectory guided by a simple adage: ‘If we could create a company that if it existed would put us out of business, what would it look like?’  This is a winning formula for our clients, our employees, and our shareholders.” ",2019-08-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cqem10/effi_nexteligent_holdings_inc_announces/
