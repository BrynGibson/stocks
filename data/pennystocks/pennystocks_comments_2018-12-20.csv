Start by ‚Äúpaper trading‚Äù. This is a great way to do research, and put your knowledge to the test. Keep doing that until you see that your paper trades are profitable. And then start with small investments etc.

TD Ameritrade has a platform called Thinkorswim. They have trader education videos on their platform. Not the lower end of commissions and charges. Their platform is super easy to use. 

I started with options and now I primarily trade futures contracts. I trade based on what the market is doing or what it could do. I have a margin account which allows me to take short positions, which is what you want to have when you understand the risk factors associated which a margin account. I make more money faster taking a short position. Like over the past 2 1/2 months. Tripled my earnings with the current downturn in 2 1/2 months in the futures market.

It‚Äôs easier to predict movements that a lot of big companies are grouped into. Compared to an up and coming company that‚Äôs price is swinging everywhere because of unreported news or things like that.

I am in and out of the market everyday for the most part. Days like the past few weeks I take short positions in the futures market and ride it till about an hour or two before the market closes and close my positions. Then I‚Äôll get back in back in sometime after the futures market opens later that same night. 

When a day is somewhat indecisive, which hasn‚Äôt happened to much recently, very directional days. But on ‚Äúsideways moving‚Äù days I‚Äôll use bolinger bands. I have a set of patterns that I‚Äôll trade and that is in on out of the market like 8-20 times in the day just making money throughout the up and down in the day. 

Those two ways I trade, I make a substantial amount of money everyday. I learned options, stocks, bonds and futures. I trade only futures now and I have grown my account almost twice my yearly goal this year. Everything just clicked about February of this year. I‚Äôve been active daily trading since 2010. So I had to teach myself so much crap that I now never use. But for sure learn basics of all ‚Äúmajor‚Äù ways to trade and if you put the effort into each one, you know what works best for you. 

Get to learning now. If I was your age when in started, I would never worked a regular ‚Äújob‚Äù. I live off-grid in the mountains and I travel a lot snowboarding and vacationing with my fam. Trading has given me abilities to be an entrepreneur. I may have started my business learning and entrepreneurial foundations in a not so much legal way when I was younger. Trading is much less stressful and when you get a nice trading balance, you can make a lot of money most of the time.
