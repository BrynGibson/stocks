Their building their own battery plants so that they don't have to buy from another company. They've developed a market for home charging equipment (during or post-sale of the vehicle), and they collect revenue from their Supercharger network.

They've also diversified from a car company to an overall power company. They're providing solar production and storage across residential, commercial and utility scale.
