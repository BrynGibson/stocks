3 hours ago by PR Newswire
Companies Mentioned: NRGMF, GLNCY, WCTXF, FTSSF, KATFF
A handful of Canadian major and junior miners are ramping up operations to mine cobalt and lithium in 2018, betting on demand for a reliable source of the metal that is in high demand as a key component of electric cars all while battery makers seeking new sources of cobalt and lithium. One of the key trends seen in 2017 has been increasing EV sales forecasts, which have made the end game much clearer. Looking ahead to 2018, investors are wondering whether the electric car revolution will continue to have an impact on lithium, and more importantly, what to expect from the market going forward. In terms of prices, Andrew Barber, investor relations manager at Orocobre (TSX: ORL), said current lithium carbonate (LCE) pricing is running at around $12,000 to $14,000, while lithium hydroxide prices are $2,000 to $3,000 higher. He forecasts that this trend will ""remain firm"" going forward. With one eye on accelerating demand for electric vehicles, BMW AG said it is talking to suppliers of cobalt and other battery materials amid fears that stocks will run short and push already inflated prices higher. Today's active miners with current developments in the market include: LiCo Energy Metals Inc. (OTC: WCTXF) (TSX-V: LIC), Katanga Mining Limited (OTC: KATFF) (TSX: KAT), NRG Metals Inc. (OTC: NRGMF) (TSX-V: NGZ), Glencore plc (OTC: GLNCY) (LSE: GLEN), First Cobalt Corp. (OTC: FTSSF) (TSX-V: FCC).",2018-01-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7nwayt/if_anyone_want_a_bit_of_reading_take_a_look_new/

Their technology began winning awards a few years ago and still does. They were trading at .05 up until September. They had changed up management earlier in the year. September they halted to announce a 400 Million dollar deal with a foreign military. the price popped up to .30 very quickly in the days that followed. The first PO was to come in Q4 and was delayed into the new year. right now it is sitting at .40. They seem to have their hands in a whole lot of different cookie jars now. 2018 looks like it will be a big year for them. When the initial PO comes MRS will be most likely sitting above a dollar.
