Typically don't quote me, but when companies buy into other companies like this. They believe the company is worth 10 times what they are paying. So they are saying .40 a share they believe the company is worth 4.00 a share. So they believe the company is worth 100x their value at market open today. They are taking a bet at buying in at .4 a share, which usually also gives them some say in different aspects of the company, under the assumption that the company is going to rise well above that mark.

As of writing this the company is up 125% and sitting at .083 cents a share, with a gain of .04615. 

Personally I believe this is $Fizz, buying into the company, to see how it does, and if it takes off, they will do a partnership with them.  ",2019-01-15
