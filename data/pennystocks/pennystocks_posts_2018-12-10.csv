6,Farm Bill (With hemp/cbd legalization) passes conference committee of House.,a4xz6y,Creativity_Rater,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a4xz6y/farm_bill_with_hempcbd_legalization_passes/,1,1,"[https://mobile.twitter.com/KYComer/status/1072149031646834690](https://mobile.twitter.com/KYComer/status/1072149031646834690)   


It will see the house, then senate, then President.  


This bill is extremely important, and after this congressional term the house is blue, so this bill is very likely to pass. This is the last chance that the all red government can pass their version of the farm bill before a deadlocked congress (it assists farmers obviously, SNAP recipients, and entrepreneurs looking to make plays in CBD/Hemp). It has been seen by the CBO for cost estimates, and the House and Senate have been talking about this bill for months.  


While hemp is legal to buy and import from other countries, it never had crop insurance and needed research grants to produce within the country (so think margins). 

&amp;#x200B;

CBD was a schedule 1 drug according to the DEA. With this bill big chains will be looking to invest/sell, and people will look to invest in stocks. Just a heads up with those trying to beat the bubble/try to invest in the future.",2018-12-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a4xz6y/farm_bill_with_hempcbd_legalization_passes/

NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **via OTC PR WIRE--** Life On Earth, Inc. (OTCQB: LFER) announced today its litigation with TCA Global Fund has been dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a confidential settlement.  The Company did not disclose the amount of the settlement due to the confidential terms of the agreement, but according to public records, the litigation that was in dispute with TCA was in excess of $1 Million Dollars as of the Company’s last 10K Annual Report. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo, said in a statement, “This resolution ends nearly two years of litigation with TCA, it eliminated the drain from our Company’s resources from this litigation, and resolves the alleged total debt and alleged damages that TCA was claiming in this litigation.”  


The Company also announced it closed on nearly $1.3 Million in private financing this year. Mr. Leonzo added, “This round of capital from our existing shareholders is a resounding vote of confidence from those who share our long term vision of the future for our company. With the elimination of the cost of litigation as well as having to service high interest rate loans, draining the Company’s capital and human resources, the Company’s management will now be one hundred percent focused on top line revenue growth, a race to profitability as well as making our brands category leaders as part of our initiative to deliver value for our shareholders. We are very excited about our prospects heading into 2019 and beyond, as we aim to participate in huge markets and new opportunities, that have presented themselves to us as never before in the company’s history.”

The Company has filed an 8K adjoining this press release and it can be found on the SEC.gov website for filings.",2018-12-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a4xga2/lfer_life_on_earth_inc_pays_off_all_outstanding/

12,The case for ARPO,a4x6s5,rawrsonrawr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a4x6s5/the_case_for_arpo/,1,0,"This will be my first thorough DD so feel free to point out if I made any mistakes.

**Company:**

ARPO (Aerpio Pharmaceuticals) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular diseases.

**Catalyst:**

AKB-4924 is a prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor. Inhibition of PHD enzymes stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription. HIFs are a family of transcription factors that modulates the body’s response to stress.

Here is an extract from their 2nd quarter earnings report:

""In June 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gossamer Bio, Inc. (including its affiliates, “Gossamer”), under which the Company has granted Gossamer an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize AKB-4924 (now known as GB004), our selective stabilizer of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, or HIF-1 alpha, in development for the treatment of IBD. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Gossamer made an upfront payment to the Company of $20.0 million. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $400.0 million in development, commercial, and sales milestone payments. If GB004 is approved and commercialized, the Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of GB004 ranging from a high-single-digit to a mid-teens percentage of net sales. In May 2018, the Company announced the initiation of dosing in a Phase 1a, multiple-ascending dose study of GB004.""

They are expecting to get the results this quarter. Depending on how successful their upcoming clinical trial results will be, they could receive a hefty sum of additional funding. Their current market cap as of December 10th is $84.42M and even if they will receive part of that $400 million that they are eligible for, they could increase their value significantly.
