0,SIPC CBD/Hemp beer play,9ak5su,Fiddli,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9ak5su/sipc_cbdhemp_beer_play/,20,12,Last week I posted about CANB and the monster run they would have. It was a nice 5 bagger for me. With the investment from big Alcohol companies into the MJ sector I believe SIPC will have a bigger run than CANB this week. SIPC is the only public traded  company that makes Hemp/CBD beer in the US. People who are looking for a beverage play will undoubtedly land on SIPC. I told many of the people who followed me on the CANB run that I would post here when I found a potential mover and I believe SIPC can easily be a 4+ bagger. Feel free to do DD on the company I just wanted to let everyone know before the run starts on Monday. ,2018-08-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9ak5su/sipc_cbdhemp_beer_play/
1,"$BDCI ""the stock to buy if your trying to get rich with a couple 1000 dollars""",9ak2dx,kaoticorder,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9ak2dx/bdci_the_stock_to_buy_if_your_trying_to_get_rich/,5,9,"""In case you forgot everything going on with bdci. I would look at cannabis consortiums website and go through all of it. Cali operations,Colorado operations, specialty items, and the rest. bdci has 3 devices now if they took over all of cannabis consortiums operations. 12 states with operations.This is serious. Indulge oils are made from cannabis from a farm in cali. infused edibles are also. This is the stock to buy if your trying to get rich with a couple 1000 dollars. This is the most solid nickel play on the otc hands down imo [https://cannabisconsortium.net/](https://cannabisconsortium.net/)"" -- [Source](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=143174398)",2018-08-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9ak2dx/bdci_the_stock_to_buy_if_your_trying_to_get_rich/
