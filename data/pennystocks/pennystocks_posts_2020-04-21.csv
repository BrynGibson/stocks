17,TOPS - A Quality Post,g59j4k,justasbadasyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g59j4k/tops_a_quality_post/,1,13,"Company Profile: TOPS Ships Inc.

Ticker: TOPS
 
Description:

TOPS is a Greek-based company that owns and operates numerous vessels that are used to transport oil and chemical products. According to their website, they own modern and fuel-efficient vessels and have high standards of performance, reliability, and safety. They currently own and operate nine product and chemical tankers along with two crude oil tankers. They have a reputable management team, and their CEO founded the company in 2000, with experience in the shipping company since 1992. They take pride in their professionalism with the people they hire to maintain and operate their vessels and how environmentally friendly they are using new technology and having a ""young"" set of ships compared to other companies. 

Bull Thesis:

Currently, with oil prices negative, this stock could quickly go up for a quick gain. These companies will need to store their oil somewhere, and TOPS could benefit them. This is prime to make some moves, and I believe they could have some more good news in the upcoming weeks, and that could increase their stock prices.

Bear Thesis:

Their current vessels are already contracted, but that won't stop inexperienced investors from hopping on the bandwagon. Also, they could buy new ships or figure out ways to profit from the oil drop. Either way, I believe in the short term, this stock could increase. 

Financials:

Financials aren't necessarily the best; they will most likely continue to pollute their stock and continue to have offerings. They agreed not to make an offer for the next two and a half weeks so that we could see an increase up until then and a potential drop. Like many companies, they are in much debt, but their revenue has dramatically increased from 2018 to 2019, as well their assets have increased from 2018-2019 by around 17%. They are looking to expand and become a profitable company. 

Potential 2020 Catalyst

Continuation to acquire and operate new vessels 

Authors Note: 

This stock has a low market-cap of a bit over 283M, and with the closing price of just about $1.58 on April 20, 2020, I believe this is an excellent stock for either a day trader or long term hold. They will most likely continue to dilute this stock further to raise money for operating costs and continuing to acquire new vessels, but long term, it looks like they could be a leader in the shipping industry.",2020-04-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g59j4k/tops_a_quality_post/
18,VBIV - A Quality Post,g59inw,justasbadasyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g59inw/vbiv_a_quality_post/,1,9,"Company Profile: VBI Vaccines Inc.

Ticker: VBIV

Description:
 
VBIV is a commercial-stage biotech company that specializes in producing a few different antivirus vaccines. According to their website, they are developing next-generation vaccines and immunotherapeutics to address unmet needs in infectious diseases and immuno-oncology"". They are developing new and advanced technology that are on the brink to help combat the need for the healthcare industry. Motley Fool recently wrote about an article that included them titled ""Why These COVID-19 Vaccine Stocks Soared Today"". Their headquarters are located in the US, research in Canada and they are manufactured in Israel. 

Bull Thesis:

Unlike some pharmaceutical companies in clinical trials, VBIV has SIX drugs in their trials, so if one or two fail, it might not be a huge deal. If these drugs see the light of day, shareholders could have a field day with their profits.

Bear Thesis:

Like all biotech companies, VBIV is risky, but they seem to have a safety net with the amount of products they could produce. They may dilute their stock but would only affect short term prices.

Financials:

Their earnings dropped from 2018-2019 by over 50%, and their net income in 2019 was -1,117%. With the approval and continuation of their drugs could move the company in the right direction to make a profit and have the potential to become a significant player in the pharmaceutical industry. 

Potential 2020 Catalyst 

-Continuation of their six drugs in clinical trials and potential approval of a few
-Potential buyout or partnership opportunity (pure speculation)
-JPM Conference April 22, 2020

Authors Note:

This stock has a low market-cap of a bit over 32M, and with the closing price of just about 28 cents on April 20, 2020, I believe this is an excellent stock for either a day trader or long term hold, although an offering may have an impact on the stock which isn't necessarily likely, but they will eventually need to raise money.

It relates to Covid-19 in the sense that they have Thermal cameras that are used for temperature detection to identify people with a fever in  public. 

They have been working with Wynn Resorts in Las vegas, installing the thermal cameras. I heard they also have been in talks with Amazon. Basically, once the economy opens in the early stages employers are going to have to install thermal cameras to pre-screen employees for the safety of their employees, its recommended in the CDC guidance for implementing saftey practices, so the thermal cameras will be in high demand then. 

The stock price will go up this week if they release a new PR and also the volume of shares looked good today.

Transport companies that offer storage for oil (tankers) are going to do really well over the next week. Dry shipping companies are going to go up a bit as well because of FOMO and people not knowing what they own, but don't fall for the trap of certain other companies that like to rise when oil tankers do and then crash when people realize what they are.

I'm not going to tell you ""OMG TOPS rocket ship 5+ PT by EOW"" or other pumping nonsense, but if you want a stock to ride up through the next few days and then turn a nice profit this stock is a perfect opportunity right now, between both market conditions and trading patterns and the actual business the company is in becoming more and more necessary and the hype surrounding it.

Newsfile Corp.   
Newsfile Corp   
Phoenix, Arizona--(Newsfile Corp. - April 21, 2020) - The Stock Day Podcast welcomed PCT LTD (OTC Pink: PCTL), a company that focuses its business on acquiring, developing and providing sustainable, environmentally safe disinfecting, cleaning and tracking technologies. CEO of the Company, Gary Grieco, joined Stock Day host Everett Jolly.   
Jolly began the interview by noting the Company's recent increase in sales, and asked whether or not this trend is expected to continue. ""Yes, we had this big rush to sell, but now what is occurring is we are beginning to get another line of distributors,"" explained Grieco, noting that the Company currently has three new distributors and is expecting to add an additional three to four distributors within the next ten days. ""Each one of these distributors is already in business,"" said Grieco. ""What they are doing is shifting from using the harsh chemicals to using our product in their businesses,"" he continued, adding that hospitals have also expanded their use of the product in their facilities.   
""Although the initial panic-buying has subsided, we'll be growing certainly this month and into the foreseeable future,"" shared Grieco.   
The conversation then turned to dilution and outstanding shares. Grieco noted that dilution occurred prior to January 2020, but shared that any shares that are currently being issued are meant for growth. ""We are in a position as a company on a cash flow basis to cover the burn-rate,"" said Grieco. ""So, we finally have free available cash flow,"" he added. ""We have to expand very rapidly. We see a need, starting in July, to start delivering at least 25 systems a month,"" said Grieco.   
Jolly then commented on the Company's latest press release detailing a distribution agreement with the UK NHS company. Grieco shared that the agreement will likely begin with five systems starting in July and will later expand to fulfill the needs of their healthcare system.   
Grieco then addressed rumors that the Company is expanding into China. Grieco shared that the Company signed an MOU in January of 2020, which required the Company to deliver systems. ""When the pandemic broke, we took that out of the equation,"" said Grieco. ""What we have done is tabled any discussions until late summer,"" he continued. ""I don't feel that we should be shipping any systems anywhere as long as we need them here in the United States.""   
""How are you going to manage this rapid growth?"" asked Jolly. Grieco expanded on the potential of the Company's Fort Wayne facility, sharing that the Company can grow by about 40% with this facility. ""The Little River facility will be strictly for R&amp;D and speciality orders on equipment,"" said Grieco when explaining the Company's plan for growth moving forward. ""We're going to shift all of the manufacturing to Fort Wayne,"" he continued, noting that the Company is also taking precautions to make necessary upgrades as they continue to grow.   
To close the interview, Grieco shared that the Company has faced major challenges with success and is now on a rapid growth path which includes their work in the healthcare industry, as well as in the oil, gas, and cannabis industries.

Most important thing to note here is that not only are we getting extremely close to FDA EUA, but we're also going to get more information on orders.  FDA EUA, and information on product orders... this will be a huge announcement. 

They also go on to note that older tests that are being used today pale in comparison to their tests, in that not only are their tests far less intrusive and painful than some of the tests that are being widely used today, but get results in a small fraction of the time (15 seconds). 

Our system is overwhelmed, being able to get patients out any faster is a huge plus.

They also mention that they're nearing completion of the FDA EUA process for their at-home kit. This means their at home kit has been bench tested and are ready to present. 

I also went over their last announcement, and there's a small blurb that many glossed over: 

""COMPANY BEGINS SCALE PURCHASES OF GENVIRO!‚Ñ¢ COMPONENTS, CREATING PACKAGING USING FDA EUA LABELING GUIDANCE, APPLICATION IN PROCESS FOR GENVIRO!‚Ñ¢"" 

The company is confident they will receive EUA, and have already started the packaging process.

**These tests are coming, now is the time to get in**

edit:

Aw shit. **THIS** is big news.... [The FDA has begun granting EUA for covid-19 home test kits.](https://www.foxnews.com/science/fda-authorizes-first-at-home-coronavirus-test) **Everything is falling into place**
