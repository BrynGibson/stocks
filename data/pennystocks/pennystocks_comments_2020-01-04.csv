Oil will remain a bit higher on mid east tensions, but that initial surge is over until more escalation happens, if it happens. 

Secondly, you need to be more careful about the specific stocks you pick. CEI for example is a total scam company, and this is coming from a guy who looks for diamonds in the rough. CEI used to have a business model of working over old oil wells that other companies had cast off when they became unprofitable. This didn't do well, so then they tried to merge with a pipeline repair company. They announced yesterday that this deal is falling through... In the past couple years they have RS several times and the value of their stock has dropped 99%, so the stock is a total hot potato for anyone holding it.",2020-01-04

There were a couple moments in the video where this was said. Folks should be grilling you to define ""many times.""
