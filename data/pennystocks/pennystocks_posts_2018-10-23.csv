1,GBR Buy the Rumor,9ql3gc,labiumuidel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9ql3gc/gbr_buy_the_rumor/,1,6,"There are a few reasons why I am bullish on GBR.

1) They are suing Mintbrokers for $6million (which is about 2x the current market cap) 

2) The recent 8-K shows that RIA is buying a controlling stake in GBR which will put them back in compliance with listing standards, the 3 million shares they are buying should not dilute the float either. 

3) ta and charting looking good, closed above the 50ma with a large bullish engulfing candle on the daily, the macd is opening up which is a bullish signal, the rsi is not overbought but in bullish territory, and the volume in the last 10 minutes of trading was over 200k shares several times the average volume. 

4) GBR is a former runner that went from $1.50 to over $12 and has little resistance beyond $3-$4, it has a very small float @ about 2 million shares so it can move quick, but doesn't have a history of r/s after r/s or dilution, and has held a bottom of about $2 in the last few monthes. 

I am watching tomorrow for it to carry over the momo it got going today into close and get the bull run started.

GH Capital Adds Two Seasoned Executives to Lead its Management Team and Board of Directors

Sets Stage for Acceleration of Business Strategy

MIAMI, FL / ACCESSWIRE / October 23, 2018 / GH Capital, Inc. (OTCQB: GHHC), a diversified FinTech holding company offering a range of financial solutions for businesses layered with an advisory platform to assist companies going public, today announced that Mr. William Bollander has joined the Company as its Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Bane Katic has joined the Company as its Chief Operating Officer. Both Executives have also been named to the Board of Directors.

Mr. Bollander has over 20 years of experience in the public markets, having held various leadership positions with several publicly traded companies in the U.S. He has been instrumental in start-up and turnaround situations.

Mr. Katic shall expand GH Capital´s IPO Advisory Service Division. Over the last four years, Mr. Katic has advised various startup companies in Europe from diversified industries to manage its operations as an independent consultant.

GH Capital´s IPO Advisory Service Division is primarily focused in helping private companies in its Going Public Process in the U.S.

Our IPO Advisory Service includes an all in one service package at low cost. As most IPO´s even small IPOs can become very expensive and challenging GH Capital is paving the way for it´s clients in becoming a publicly traded company.

GH Capital´s service fee is based on a mix of cash and equity compensation and starts with about $80,000 attached with an equity stake of its IPO client.

Private companies at an emerging growth stage, which are seeking for a going public solution are in need to find an affordable solution to minimize their going public expenses.

Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Katic, commented, ""It´s our goal to expand massively GH Capital´s IPO Adivisory Service Division. I can see an enormous potential of new IPO clients specially in Europe.""

There is no alternative for so called micro and small-cap companies or startups to go public.

OTC Markets with its tiers OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC PINK is a perfect solution from our prospective.

Additionally, Mr. Wolfgang Ruecker has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer, but will remain on the Board of Directors. Mr. Ruecker will continue to assist the Company on its business and capital markets strategy.

PHOENIX, Oct. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **HempAmericana, Inc., (OTCQB:**[ HMPQ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xxoo2reEUb7B6I8xboWr5F_xNygviFCp6GjbcIUhQ4qhJ7xOrZPUVVKTySawGUxPlZyc8uct3G9Vz3RVaf9Vww==)**) (the “Company”)** is working to expand their company. CEO Salvador Rosillo is making a return appearance on Uptick Newswire’s “Stock Day” podcast with Everett Jolly.  


Jolly welcomed Rosillo back to the show and asked him about operations of HempAmericana since their last interview back in August.

“We are in full extraction mode from the 4 tons of flower we had purchased,” explained Rosillo. “We are completely debt free as of yesterday. Everything has been paid.”

He then explained after the recovery of the oil is the distiller, that is the first stage of commercialization. He said they have contracted with a manufacturer of the machine necessary for the next part of the process.

“As you know, this is a new industry. Everything has to be invented or adjusted for the new reality. So, we are in full production, in two weeks the machines arrive and by the end of November we will be earning revenue.”

Jolly then noted that HempAmericana, Inc. did a reduction in shares from 6 billion shares to 3.75 billion shares. He wanted to know how that decision came about.

“As being a newbie, experts told me to have 6 billion shares, but then I found out it’s better to have less,” said Rosillo. “We couldn’t cut immediately, so as soon as I could I cut and I’m going to cut some more. In the meantime, we are fully sufficient and we are on the threshold of revenue.”

Jolly then asked about the future plans of his company. Rosillo explained that expansion is in their future.

“What’s arriving now is a bottling machine to make one and two ounce droplets of CBD. Most of the CBD being marketed at the moment in that type of little bottle, it takes 4 little bottles to make one gram. That is rather weak formula. Our intention is not that part of the market, we are looking to be the best CBD that really has an effect on you and we are not so interested in maximizing every cent at the expense of the health the patient or quality of the product. We are interested in creating a legacy, a business that will be here after I’m gone,” said Rosillo.

Jolly then asked about the company’s new website, [HempAmericana.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TEbikORrSod18tYy35piFSh_YA4aglezop9oaRYki3XrYFlUsJY4C416yUNgEt1rmE_HZHbeLRDSXOg9eDYIbaTWvg9VdP4vpOsinuZ1nmg=). Rosillo said he bought a lot of domains that all point to this new website, but in addition to that the company is also expanding acreage in Maine. He then told Jolly that they will be concentrating on CBD in the near future.

“We are going to market it, at the beginning, wholesale but as we expand, we will add value adding products. But the main thing is we will have a revenue from wholesale in three weeks’ time.”

ORMOND BEACH, Fla., Oct. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Rooshine, Inc.** (OTC PINK: RSAU) has rented a large facility in Devon, England where we will set up a system for barrel aging and also a separate system for aging the spirits.  Most competitors place the distilled spirits in a new wooden barrel and allow it to age for years to obtain its flavor profile.  Our proprietary process actually ages the barrel by caramelizing the inside of the barrels with smoked herbs, spices.  This speeds the process and provides a superior aged product in days versus years.  Most smoked spirits lose their smoky qualities once the bottle is opened.  Our process infuses a permanent smoked profile which lingers from the first sip to the last drop in the bottle.  


We will provide these aged barrels to our distillery in Inverness, Scotland, where they will produce high volume, superior quality, barrel-aged spirits.  These will be blended with other fine Scotch whiskies, bottled and made available as sponsored, limited edition, high-end spirits. 

Les McCall, our Board Chairman, was interviewed by Everett Jolly of Uptick Newswire.  Les shared his views on Rooshine, where we are and where we are going.  You can listen to the podcast at [https://upticknewswire.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kQrBHx-r7OvsUI_WZeZj6AnsNAW7mSB9O9ABfu_aPi3DNx7tc0rmrPntspXvqj3AmIMQAUQuVX9jw0hhrKh8vvp4LaHnOTxNBqZxqdpmLkI=) on Wednesday morning, Oct. 17th.

*“We are moving quickly to establish production so that we can begin generating revenues this 4th quarter of 2018,”* said Larry R. Curran, CEO of Rooshine, Inc.  Les McCall, Rooshine’s Board Chairman, further commented, *“At last people are starting to understand how unique we are.  One thing you cannot argue with is the public taste.  We are very pleased with our reception.  It has been fabulous hearing all the public and professional testimonies expressing awe as to our process and praising Rooshine’s complex aroma, complex taste and smooth finish.  They cannot believe that it is not a 10- to 20 year-old whiskey.”*
