This reddit user articulated it better than I could, but basically, you are buying 10% of Ocugen.   
I found this point specifically insightful:  


&gt; Lastly, take a look at the first two tiers at 100 and 200m market cap value. $8 - 12 million minimum in cost for IPO. With the logic that the reverse merger is ""cheaper,"" than IPO, that wouldn't leave much room for cost savings versus a traditional IPO with HSGX's prior market cap at 9 - 10 million before the merger occurred. All signs point bullish in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

With it nearly doubling its market cap since my post last Friday, it’s on the higher end of the valuation price in my opinion for Ocugen making it a riskier bet. I am not a broker, so this isn’t advice, but I locked in profits myself. I will wait for a pull back on the daily. Some have speculated this may close the .41¢ gap from before, and if it does, that would have been my highest target but I wanted to be safe. Good luck to all holding longer.",2019-06-13

With 10% payout for HSGX price that would put Ocugen at roughly 320m market cap as of the current share price at .337

With 15% it would put Ocugen at 192m.

This may still have room to grow, but again, it isn’t the safe bet it was last week. The biggest factor making it pop above this and even .41¢ would require major positive news from Ocugen’s OCU-310 phase 3 results.
