I think OP is saying, he waited until after earnings to make a decision on if the current value of the underlying was going to keep growing or shrink back down to a reasonable level. Having due diligence under his belt, he bet that it was overvalued and bought options accordingly.

I don't see the problem with his methodology. Sure, if he was dropping 25% of his account into this one bet, that'd be one thing. But, 44% gains = $22 profit tells us that he wagered about $50. He can very quickly and very easily calculate, ""if I'm wrong, I lose $50."" I'd argue that this is a much safer alternative to ""I hope this penny stock doubles...oh they went bankrupt."" It allows him to ""wager"" $50 and quickly collect a 44% return based on DD (proper or not) and an opinion that the market is overvaluing the underlying. If he's wrong, he's out $50. Law of large numbers will help him overall if his DD and opinions aren't completely wrong/random and he's exercising discipline.

My advice to you however, OP, would be to always take your profits and don't get greedy. My biggest losers have been when I'm up 50% and decide to ride it out, ""oh man, what if this triples!"" It doesn't always melt away, and sometimes you'll kick yourself for not sticking it out, but I'd argue that that's the larger gamble -- when you formulate an opinion and you're proven right, and instead of taking the money you allow greed to take over. Not trying to humblebrag -- I closed 3 positions over the last 2 days, each with 50% gains. On 2 of the 3 positions, I could've held on for more gains. If you add up all the times I left trades early in the last week, I could've just about doubled my gains in that period.

But, I've learned. I didn't take my profits in the past, and I'm only just now catching my portfolio up to where I was a few months ago. It hurts to watch as you miss out on an additional 50% gain, but it hurts even more to watch your 50% gain turn into a 50% loss. Remember the psychology that it pains us more to lose $X than it feels good to gain $X. Don't trick yourself into chasing more and more.",2018-04-30

It was the idea that you can bring together 50000 people. Tell them you can accurately predict the stock movements 10 days in a row. Tell half that itll go down, and half that itll go up. Then of those who were correct, split them again, telling half it will go up, and half it will go down. Do this 10 times in a row, where you keep splitting the group in half. At the end of the 10 days, you will have convinced 50 people you can predict the stocks with 100% accuracy. 

The point im trying to make, is as I pointed out on your other post, you made 5 calls. Of those 5 calls, only 1 succeeded, AXXA. You now offer the same call, plus an additional failed call from that set, plus two additional new calls. 

AXXA is unstable, and has terrible volume and a very bad RSI.

UHLN had 3 good days, but is severely overbought, and will crash tomorrow. The candlesticks are evidence of that even without taking RSI into consideration.

IFXY is an overbought breakout. They went up because they had announced signing on with 2 new ICOs. I would look for confirmation before you buy. If tomorrow they are red, don't buy. Forget it. I wouldn't have high hopes.

BRKK is also overbought, with no news. Hard to tell yet if this is a correction or a pump and dump. Ultimately, all of them look like targets of pump and dumps.

I do like covered calls as well, though. I hold 300 $NOK shares and just keep writing covered calls (as well as writing puts if I'd like to own the underlying). I've probably made around $50 over the last 2-weeks on $NOK. Sure, Nokia could plummet any day now, but I like the company and I've held at least 100 shares for the last year and a half.

When buying and selling options, it’s the value of the option contract, not the value of the underlying asset (stock), that you’re buying. This is why expiration date and volatility of the stock factor into the value of an options contract. For example, If a stock is super volatile, the fixed price of an option contract is valuable, increasing the value of the contract. Price of the underlying stock is only part of what factors into the value of a contract.  This is just a basic understanding to try to wrap your head around options, I’m not an expert.
