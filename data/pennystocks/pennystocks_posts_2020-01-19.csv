0,Recommend a platform?,equbgm,BonnieMason1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/equbgm/recommend_a_platform/,1,13,"Hi, 

I've been doing the odd trade here and there on Trading 212 but I've been studying and I'm ready to move over to a more comprehensive trading platform. 

I'm UK based, so can anyone recommend a good platform or tell me the platform that they use? 

I've been looking at a range of them and just wanted a bit of a pointer as I've downloaded a bunch of demos and nothing seems to fit as yet. 

Cheers in advance!",2020-01-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/equbgm/recommend_a_platform/

There are 43,000 used car dealerships and nearly 18,000 franchise dealerships in the ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 

Powerband is working on partnering with RouteOne (owned by GM, Ford, Toyota, etc), and one of the two bank portals all dealerships use, gives it access to 33,000 dealerships and 1800 lenders across North America.

No debt.
Low float w recent buy back.
