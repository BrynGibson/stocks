A great place to start there is the Leader boards where you can see biggest winners of all time, last 30 days, etc., and then go to one of those users' list of trades and see what they are doing. Some of them will keep decent notes about their thought processes, but there is so much involved in researching and identifying good picks/tops/bottoms/etc. that it would be very difficult to get that level of detail on any site. Usually you can message a user on there and ask questions about a trade and they might throw you some info.
