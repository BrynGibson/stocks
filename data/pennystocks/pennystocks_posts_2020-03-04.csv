0,Trivago is most likely going downhill and quickly,fdfkli,ww1superstar,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fdfkli/trivago_is_most_likely_going_downhill_and_quickly/,1,6," 

Does anyone thing a travel website is going to do WELL in the corona virus?Obviously they wont. Literally they had poor 4th quarter revenue simply due to the coronavirus, and the coronavirus didn't even have a big effect in 4th quarter 2019. Trivago is going downhill and fast.

* Negative earnings in 4th quarter 2019
* Due for MASSIVE losses in earnings in 1st quarter 2019
* Yahoo Finance has it as an overvalued stock (that's the extent of my TA skills)
* Has been in down trend for years

Literally a falling knife stock. I think buying puts is easy way to make some money. My contracts are for $2.5 strike price on 3/20 but if you want to go all in go for anything after their first quarter earnings call on 4/17.",2020-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fdfkli/trivago_is_most_likely_going_downhill_and_quickly/

11,Beware INPX bullish revenue number - new offering announced yesterday!,fddwvz,stompingllama,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fddwvz/beware_inpx_bullish_revenue_number_new_offering/,1,0,"INPX put out their 10-k yesterday, and are touting 68% revenue growth.  It's worth noting that most of that is due to acquiring Jibestream in August, and is therefore not organic growth but acquisition growth that shareholders paid for through dilution.  Accounting for acquisitions, organic growth was about 30%.  Which is great generally speaking, but would put them about 6 years away from profitability.  It's also lower than the 42% CAGR they've been quoting for their industry in their press releases.  Q4 saw them amass $18m in losses on just $1.9m revenues.  This is partly because of a $10.6m debt owed by Sysorex, who have no means of paying back, that was previously listed as an asset.  I wrote that this would (or at least should) happen a couple months ago here: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/51112064-jdhamilt/5397181-inpixon-corporate-structure-and-fundamentals-point-to-risk-and-overvaluation

Maybe most importantly, and this only shows up in SEC filings as opposed to the newswire, they followed up the ER with a $50m at-the-market offering yesterday.  You can expect they will dilute on every upward move the stock does.  Happy trading!  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1529113/000121390020005329/0001213900-20-005329-index.htm",2020-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fddwvz/beware_inpx_bullish_revenue_number_new_offering/
12,I think my approach to Day Trading has been has been completely wrong - insights from experienced traders requested,fddsmh,LemonGelato,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fddsmh/i_think_my_approach_to_day_trading_has_been_has/,1,15,"I  believe I have completely missed out on a fundamental aspect, I'd appreciate your opinions! I won't even mention the stock by name that made me come to this realization (as I'm sure anyone following this sub is tired of hearing about it). 

The basic philosophy of course is to buy low and sell high, but I feel that myself (and a lot of other inexperienced members on this sub, judging from frequent post topics) are going about it in a way that runs counter to the entire strategy of day trading. It doesn't make sense to hold on to stocks that are going down, while hoping for a moonshot. Say you bought at $3, but expect it to eventually shoot to $10, even if that ends up being true you are losing money while holding onto it as it fluctuates between $1-2 all day. If it eventually returns to $3 now you'll break even. BUT, if you had sold (even in one of the dips), you could have made your money back already by buying in the dips and selling at the rises (whereas if you just hold it the whole time, the rises to $2 will still have you at a let loss). 

I see a lot of posts about people ""missing the boat/space-ship/etc."" because they expect a stock to shoot to the moon. People say this while the stock is at $2 and they bought in at $3, when in reality people who haven't even bought yet are in a better position to make money (by buying lower) than the people who bought already. 

My other question is, wouldn't this type of trading be handled well by a computer algorithm? For example, one that could identify a pattern of a stock consistently trading between two points, and then buy/sell automatically? Is there a platform or software that exists, where you could set parameters like these and then just see how it plays out? For example, you could say if X stock falls by X%, buy $100, if rises by X%, sell.

32,Hold IBIO for longer than Friday,fdk4ux,speedingmedicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fdk4ux/hold_ibio_for_longer_than_friday/,1,37,"The director of IBIO recently obtained 350k shares of IBIO late last year. In January Eastern Capital ltd, a private firm specializing exclusively in investing in biotech companies, obtained a whopping 37 million shares of IBIO. Both insider trades so I've linked the paperwork on the bottom.

So far 4/6 of Eastern's biggest investments have been extremely successful.

They are having a shareholder's meeting tomorrow which could also report positive news as well. They recently published a press release announcing a partnership with a chinese firm, CC-pharming, on the development of a covid-19 vaccine.

They have other drugs in the pipeline as well - an alternative to Rituximab, which is an anticancer/arthritis drug listed by WHO as one of the essential medicines needed by a country. The market for Rituximab is in the billions, and the partnership with cc-pharming opens them up to the massive Chinese market.

CC-pharming is located in Zhongguancun Biomedical Engineering Transformation Center. Further research indicates that this center was opened in 2016 with the backing of the Chinese government, containing state of the art facilities to promote the biomedical sector.

They have terrible revenue history so it's a purely speculative buy, but it may be worth putting a few % of your portfolio into this stock in case it blows up big over the next couple of months. The upside is definitely there imo.

https://ir.ibioinc.com/all-sec-filings?page=1

Still doing some more research on this company so I'll post more if I find any updates.

Update: They recently withdrew a proposal for a reverse stock split. This suggests that the company is confident in their ability to raise revenue as well as maintain share price. A possible recent development inside the company? Definitely a good sign.

Update 2: Congress stuck a deal providing over 7 billion in funds to fight coronavirus. IBIO may be getting some of that funding (their facility was previously funded by DARPA specifically to fight pandemics like the current coronavirus). Still speculation at this point however

Update 3: They recently went on a MASSIVE hiring spree. They went from 8 employees in 2018 up to 55 employees in 2019. This coincides with their recent partnerships in 2019/2020 as well.

They averaged less than 10 employees for the past decade then shot up to 55 in a year. Definitely something huge going on inside that facility.

Copy pasting my observations 

&gt; - The founder has a MBA from Stanford. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which means he is intellectually gifted (top 0.1% or better)
&gt; 
&gt; - Which also means he has connections in one of the richest areas in the world, San Fran Bay Area. 
&gt; 
&gt; - He founded Seed-One Ventures, which means if there's anyone who can make this stock moon, he's one of the rare people who can make this happen.
&gt; 
&gt; - He started other companies fundamentally similar to Heatbio 
&gt; 
&gt; Another important observation about the company
&gt; 
&gt; - Senior Business Development Adv has connections in China, Taiwan and Singapore
&gt; 
&gt; - She is in the Board of Directors of Chinese-American Biopharmaceutical Society
&gt; 
&gt; Rest of the team look highly competent
