https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/chinas-biggest-anime-site-bilibili-removed-app-stores-amid-content-clean/article/2157145

Bilibili is the most popular.


&gt; But, in fact, Bilibili has definitely made it. It’s so big that it now has 76 million monthly active users (with 2.5 million paying for their subscription), a convention which fans paid up to US$200 per ticket to attend, and its stocks being traded on the Nasdaq.

Keep in mind Bilibili also serves Taiwan and Japan as it’s made by Japanese speakers.

Also a search on Baidu has shown Bilibili to be alive and well in China so it shouldn’t be blocked anymore.",2020-01-21
