There is nothing that will indicate that this company will go down. Everything is extremely positive. Remember to research the company before you invest.  MNGA will sky rocket soon. No way in fucking hell it will stay at a measly .25 cents a share forever regarding all the good news and money they are bringing in. The drop was from people who didn't researched the company and when the trade halted because MNGA had to complete some paperwork , people got scared and sold all their shares. Those people don't research anything and panicked. Get in while it's still cheap cause it won't stay this cheap very long. ",2018-10-31

I do not want to accuse anybody but these type of writings are very misleading. Yes, the stock's price can spike but it is not an argument for real and stable stock price growth.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to put everything into perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I agree with redditor that you must do your own DD! Do not follow such nonsense.

2) Go to [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MNGA/financials?p=MNGA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MNGA/financials?p=MNGA) and look at the bottom line results... Income huge and increasing minus, assets are burned, no need to tell you about cash flows, you got the point.

3) This stock has a history of dilution. Stock has undergone multiple stock offerings and reverse splits. 

4) When you read such comments ""it will go to the moon"" or ""it is a sure thing"" know that these are written by promoters or very uneducated market participants.

Hope I helped;)

Your stop loss should have been  whatever your downside risk tolerance was in the original investment.  For pennystocks this might be as high as 20% on a very volatile stock (assuming your thesis is that you can make 100% gains from the stock).  My buy/sell is usually a multiple of 5/1.  If I only think I can make 5% off of stock my stop loss is 1%.

For this particular stock, right now it is a down channel.  The volume is lighter and the daily slope is more shallow.  The  most painful part should be over.  There aren't really established points for technical analysis.  I would guess there will be a little bounce tomorrow, and in news a slow drop to around $0.042 with another little bounce there.
