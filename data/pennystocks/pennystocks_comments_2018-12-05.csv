If you want to read about the runners, you could probably just look at the most active boards on ihub. 

In pennyland, the run-up attracts all the little guys who end up being bag holders. They hang around on ihub for months bitching everyday about the SEC, market maker manipulation etc until their stocks inevitably go to trips then no-bid,

why i have been hesitant to go long:

\-only 24k but they are paying off debt with preferred shares.  makes little sense.

\-lots of preferred shares will the common be screwed to high heaven eventually?

\-burned 68k last quarter but only have 24k in the bank are they going to sell more preferred to get capital?

\-cap is 83x running revenue ahhh thats a lot

\-the tea and coffee is basically tea and coffee +  Micro-encapsulated Canadian Hemp Seed oil formulated into a  
 soluble, homogenous powder. It is prepared from 100% Canadian  
 hemp seed oil and is a source of plant-based omega fatty acids.

\-products could be easily replicated

&amp;#x200B;

ok for a trade on my end but going long just havent been able to do it.  would be glad to be convinced otherwise.  almost pulled the trigger on a swing a week or so ago but missed it.  ",2018-12-05
19,Creativity_Rater,eb64lvq,/r/pennystocks/comments/a3fshy/vate_informationopiniondd/eb64lvq/,1,"Thanks for the response, I hope I can help! But I do not suggest buying in now if you're going in long! Also I believe everyone should focus on the short term for vate for now, and long them \*if\* they eventually get a Kroger/whole foods connection. 

\&gt;-only 24k but they are paying off debt with preferred shares.  makes little sense.  


A major payment that was made through preferred shares was a 1 time payment to the former company owner, and a significant portion of them were made to Robert Clark owner of the sister company. These payments were for work reasons (either wages or for control). These preferred stock have the possibility of dividends. The number is ugly, and even after my explanation its still ugly, but its less ugly hopefully.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;-lots of preferred shares will the common be screwed to high heaven eventually?

&amp;#x200B;

I do not believe so because preferred A and preferred B have the same liquidation rights as the common stock and convert at a 1 to 1 basis, I believe they are there just for dealing with volatility and the appearance of a smaller share size (plus dividends to eventually pay off friends). In the past Robert Clark has returned them at very favorable prices for some reason. I'm sure it can happen though, because of how much money KGKG's owner and Vate's owner keep pumping in to prop this.   


\&gt;-burned 68k last quarter but only have 24k in the bank are they going to sell more preferred to get capital?  


I can almost guarantee yes to sister company Kgkgs owner or their own owner. Their new PR stated they were almost cash flow positive though, so that's something.  


\&gt;-cap is 83x running revenue ahhh thats a lot  


Its revenue should shoot up due to the opening of its stores, and placement inside new stores, but even then, yeah its still in a small bubble right now. I just believe the bubble will get bigger.  


\&gt;-products could be easily replicated  


I hope by the time the market is noticeable vate will have its foot in the door.
