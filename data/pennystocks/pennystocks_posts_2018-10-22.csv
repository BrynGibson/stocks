LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Biosciences Corp. (OTCQB: APPB), a diversified cannabinoid therapeutics company focused on the medical, bioceutical and pet health industries, announced that it has expanded its product line and launched a hemp-derived CBD product pet line under the HerbalPet brand. The products will be sold on herbalpet new website ([www.herbalpet.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_8QbPU5EYSpl7D8T46ckFOf3QC8AQq9BdP-CiZ66yadrQ4YXPB-D5OaA4ENhwEIKmbyjCW50ZtjfAN2QvToGyw==)) and in select locations in the U.S.  


Although the health benefits of CBD are becoming well known, one of the challenges of working with CBD is its bitter after taste. We commonly hear this feedback in humans and the bitterness is also true for pets. Aromas from CBD are strong and to a dog that level of concentration can be displeasing. To overcome this issue, we specifically formulated the product line with natural, high protein, human grade chicken meat – our number 1 ingredient - that dog’s love.

In addition to CBD, these chews contain several important ingredients that promote good health. In the calming support chew, consists of super foods (sweet potato and turmeric) as well as antioxidants (organic chamomile) and a natural amino acid (L-Theanine). The mobility support chew also has bone broth, glucosamine, chondroitin for bone health. It is also grain-free. Importantly, these products contain no synthetic preservatives, no fillers, no Genetically Engineered Ingredients (GMO) and no animal feed ingredients.

“Remedi continues to be at the forefront of the cannabinoid market, first using organically grown plants, without pesticides or herbicides as our main ingredient and now quickly and easily providing consumers with a variety of tinctures, topical creams and alternatives to the growing demand of this space. As Applied BioSciences continues to launch our product lines in select specialty and retail stores, people will also be able to visit remedishop.com to find a holistic health and wellness alternatives that best suit their lifestyle.” commented Chris Bridges, President of Applied BioSciences Corp.

Applied BioSciences products are USDA NOP certified organic, non-GMO, vegan, paleo, gluten-free, sugar-free and THC-free. The products are formulated with organic 99%+ pure cannabidiol along with our proprietary blend of certified organic botanicals, herbals and essential oils to further optimize bioavailability.

Nexien BioPharma (OTC QB: NXEN) has 200,000,000 Authorized Shares and 43,880,896 Outstanding. The float, as of the effective S-1 filing on June 28, 2018 was only 2,710,691. That’s a very, very small float. As of July 27, 2018, NXEN (formerly NTVA) has a Market Cap of only $16.6 million (at 38¢). You can check out OTCmarkets.com for more information.
First, INTIVA BioPharma has a nice management and director line-up:
* Alain Bankier / CEO, Chief Strategist – If you simply Google his name, you’ll see he’s been a part of various Cannabis industry events — like Canna Tech, Cannabis Learn Conference &amp; Expo, and the Cannabis World Congress &amp; Business Exposition in New York. You can watch/listen to an interview he did with PotBotics. Alan Brochstein from New Cannabis Ventures wrote an article in January 2017 where it started with, “Well-known cannabis investor”. It goes on to talk about his involvement (co-founder) with New York Angels, which has more than $100 million invested in more than 200 ventures. He’s the Co-Founder and Managing Director of VS Tech Ventures, which was “created as an innovative program providing legal cannabis companies access to leading professional service providers, to help entrepreneurs build their businesses, in a cash efficient fashion and to help accelerate company traction, while continually increasing shareholder value”. Mr. Bankier is also an Advisor to New Frontier Data, whose “mission is to elevate the discussion around the legal cannabis industry globally by providing unbiased vetted information and educating stakeholders to make informed decisions.” Mr. Bankier owns more than 2.25 million shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Kevin McGovern / Advisor, Director – Mr. McGovern was a founder of SoBe Beverages, which most of you should recognize — they sold to PepsiCo in 2000 to $370 million. Mr. McGovern is the Chairman &amp; CEO of McGovern Capital, which even lists the Intiva logo on their website under Investments. On the McGovern Capital website it mentions that Kevin has co-founded (through McGovern Capital and its affiliates) more than 25 companies — 6 of which have become world/category leaders! “McGovern Capital, LLC” owns 751,113 shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Lindy Snider / Advisor, Director – Ms. Snider is the Founder and CEO of ‘Lindi Skin’, which is Specialty Skin Care for Cancer Patients. Watch her interview with PotBotics, as she discusses Cannabis investments. Ms. Snider is a dedicated philanthropist and she is an active board member of many non-profit organizations: Fox Chase Cancer Foundation, Cancer Forward, The Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, The Snider Foundation, to name a few. Lindy is the daughter of the late Ed Snider, the owner of the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, who had a net worth of $2.5 billion according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Ms. Snider is also a Director of Kanativa, a privately-held Canadian corporation which is involved with Alexa’s Botanicals — who has a line of CBD products. Lindy was said to have 440,000 shares as of the S-1 filing.

        Beyond the successful people that are running the show, it’s important to point out that NTVA does not “touch the plant,” or any derivatives of the plant. They are proceeding with its research and development activities using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved protocols, using the synthetic cannabinoid molecules, Dronabinol and Marinol.
NTVA’s drug development strategy consists of:
* The acute treatment during exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, including sarin gas. (This could be a big deal for the Middle East, where we hear about ‘Chemical Warfare‘ more commonly. Most recently in Syria.)
* The treatment of various symptoms related to myotonic and muscular diseases such as dystrophia diseases.
* The treatment of  various symptoms related to lipidosis, which are genetic disorders which are characterized by defects of the digestive system that impair the way the body uses dietary fat.
* The treatment of  various symptoms related to lipofuscinosis, in particular neural ceroid lipofuscinosis and macular degeneration associated with lipofuscinosis, which is any disorder associated with the abnormal storage of lipofuscins. Lipofuscins is a yellow to brownish pigment granule found in the muscle, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal, retina and nerve cells undergoing slow regressive changes and accumulating in lysosomes with age.
* The treatment of restless legs syndrome. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) otherwise known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and Wittmaack-Ekbom Syndrome is a term used to describe a neurological sensory disorder that also interferes with sleep and is thus also considered a sleep disorder. RLS may affect up to 8% of the population, according to Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.
* Sexual health affecting both males and females. Male sexual health issues or dysfunction issues include male erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) and desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest in sex). Female sexual health issues or dysfunction issues can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression.
To catch you up to speed on what was announced in the last month:
* On June 28, 2018, NTVA announced it has filed a utility patent application with the US Patent Office “relating to the use of cannabinoids to treat myotonia, myotonic dystrophy and other related dystrophies”.
* On July 12, 2018, NTVA announced Germany-based Dr. Benedikt Schoser as an Advisor. Dr. Schoser is said to be one of the world’s top researchers in both molecular mechanisms of muscle loss and myotonic dystrophy.
* On July 19, 2018, NTVA was upgraded to the OTC QB Venture Market, which the company said “is a reflection of our ongoing objective to provide additional visibility and credibility to the investment community, as we continue to build INTIVA BioPharma to advance the science of cannabinoid-based and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compliant medicine.”
