Hey There!

*I'm developer. I'm looking for a project for cooperation.* 

I developed a lot of telegram bots, airdrop bots, bounties platform, web pages, monitorings, slack bots, discordapp bots, reddit bots with auto-posting and etc. Developed a popular bot to protect groups from spam attacks, which consists of more than 25 groups. I automated bounty system to auto claim users bounty on steemit/golos when users do actions like following/resteem/upvote/comment and etc.

**I already helped to:**

* **WINGS** with bots, monitorings and utilities. Helped community to get quick access to the required information.
* **PTOY** with the telegram, twitter and slack bots. Developed bot to sync messages between telegram and slack which allowed users to communicate with each other without any problems.

If you'll need help, write me in PM and we'll discuss conditions.

6,Arcadia Biosciences (RKDA) on Verge of Commercializing Major Crop Technologies,9v0xfi,Darker_Depths,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9v0xfi/arcadia_biosciences_rkda_on_verge_of/,1,17,"Arcadia Biosciences, a Nasdaq listed micro-cap (\~$22 million) agricultural biotech stock, has made significant progress on the commercialization of its portfolio of \~195 plant patents and has received little attention due to its small size and obscurity. After hours today will be Arcadia's quarterly ER and conference call, which could act as a catalyst to bring attention to its recent, major developments.

Arcadia owns patents in a diverse suite of plant traits such as water and nitrogen use efficiency, and extended shelf life for major crops such as wheat, rice, corn, and tomatoes. Two major developments for commercialization have occurred in the past quarter that have gone unacknowledged:

**1)** In October, it Arcadia [received the first U.S. patent for extended shelf life wheat](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181015005347/en/Arcadia-Biosciences-Receives-Patent-Extended-Shelf-Life) (for 3+ months with lower rancidity). Quickly following this announcement was the news yesterday that Ardent Mills, North America's largest flour miller, is [collaborating to commercialize this extended shelf life technology](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181106005568/en/Arcadia-Biosciences-Ardent-Mills-Announce-Collaboration-Develop). Ardent Mills has their own wheat research and development team so it lends significant credence to the value and potential of this technology:

&gt; ‚ÄúFor several years, we have been investing in this strategy. We see this trait as a big and important step forward that will benefit bakers, food manufacturers, the food service industry, and ultimately consumers,‚Äù stated Ardent Mills CEO Dan Dye. 

Importantly, this technology was achieved through traditional breeding methods, is not GMO, and can be used for organic wheat production as well. It is difficult to project revenues for what could be a breakthrough technology, but global wheat revenues exceed $200B so the market potential is massive.

**2)** Verdeca, the company's JV with Bioceres [has developed a drought tolerant soy variety (HB4)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180808005213/en/Verdeca-Introduces-Drought-Tolerant-Soybeans-Argentina) that is approved in Argentina and has been rigorously field tested, including during the severe 2018 drought experienced in the region. Last week, [approval for added herbicide tolerance to HB4 was granted](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/verdeca-receives-approval-to-integrate-hb4-drought-tolerant-soybeans-with-herbicide-tolerance-in-argentina-2018-10-29), which is a major step toward bringing the variety to market for export to China:

&gt;""The technology is currently being bred into elite soybean varieties by Verdeca‚Äôs seed company partners, and we are preparing for the commercial launch of HB4 in 2019, pending regulatory approval in China,"" Arcadia CEO Raj Ketkar

Use of the variety during the 2018 drought in Argentina would have saved at least hundreds of millions of dollars in lost grain yield.

A final positive is the company has zero debt and has already raised cash to maintain operations without further tapping of capital markets for the next 9-12 months. The ER today could shed even greater light on the revenue potential of Arcadia's major developments this quarter and the path to 2019 revenues. These varieties represent 10+ years of development, testing, and regulatory approval that have known efficacy. This is equivalent to a medical biotech just before product launch.",2018-11-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9v0xfi/arcadia_biosciences_rkda_on_verge_of/

* GRYN plans to use the Canna Brands suite of products as a platform to introduce its existing portfolio into vertical markets, with the Cannagram technology offering highest level solutions
* With more than 25 years‚Äô experience, GRYN sees itself becoming an industry leader in the advancement of science-driven cannabis cultivation systems; it is growing its own IP assets
* Three products are acquisition keys: flagship platform Cannagram extends brand awareness, Myijuana is a destination portal and CoursePro Academy is seen as an asset for GRYN

Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (OTC: GRYN) believes that its acquisition of the Canna Brands Portfolio advances its own business model. It eyes three core products as generating for GRYN a platform for the introduction of its existing brands into vertical markets. Matthew Dole, SVP of business development at GRYN, said that the transaction also offers the potential to generate substantial revenues ([http://nnw.fm/nXDs5](http://nnw.fm/nXDs5)).

GRYN is a premium cannabis firm targeting the top-end medical and adult-use recreational markets. It sees itself becoming a leader in the advancement of science-driven cannabis cultivation systems. It is developing its own proprietary systems, algorithms, software and customized hardware. In a commercially-controlled cultivation environment, GRYN offers ultimate efficiencies. It uses hybrid-aeroponics to produce pharmaceutical grade cannabis at a higher yield and lower cost.

The three core products include Cannagram, to be re-branded as Cannagram Services. It is a flagship platform that aims to extend brand awareness. Its advanced communications and financial services are designed to meet the rapidly changing needs of the cannabis industry.

Myijuana uses news, e-commerce and reviews in a destination portal that can be enabled for consumer sales and generate product sales. Vital is the Myijuana Dispensary Directory, an online directory platform that supports premium listings, advertising and reviews.

Third is the CoursePro Academy, which GRYN sees as an asset that can create an educational destination for the cannabis industry and provide a way to introduce its own technologies and brands to the market.

Dole of GRYN focused on the future role of Cannagram when speaking in a news release. ‚ÄúThe Cannagram technology, in particular, will provide mission-critical solutions for transactional resources, tools and communications for cannabis industry providers and the recreational consumer audience, as well as providing solutions for patient care and treatment at the highest standards,‚Äù he noted.
