Hugo Saavedra, CEO of Trimax Corporation and Saavy Naturals Inc., stated, “We are strong believers that diversification is the key to success and are extremely pleased to announce our intent to diversify into the fast-growing marijuana sector with an ecommerce company that brings a leading edge mobile technological platform to the forefront of this billion dollar industry.” He also stated, “This acquisition will allow for Trimax to benefit from two wholly-owned subsidiaries that will bring multiple revenue streams into the company.”

The state of Vermont just recently passed legislation for recreational sales and was the latest addition to the already existing 30 states, nine of which allow for recreational sales, that are now allowing for the sale of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana. 

Recreational Dispensaries.com is in the process of launching in the state of California but expects to expand into every state across the U.S. that offers medicinal and recreational cannabis sales, over the next several months.

Both parties have already exchanged documents in order to complete a thorough due diligence process and expect to enter into a Definitive Agreement in order to complete the acquisition within the next 10 business days.

Hugo and Debra Saavedra, Saavy Naturals Inc.’s, CEO and President, gained instant popularity for their all-natural body care product line after being spotlighted and appearing on ABC’s hit show Shark Tank. The Sharks took an instant liking to Hugo and Debra, their love story, their previous success in the body care industry, and the superior quality of their all-natural product. Hugo and Debra have increased the company’s product line exposure with several highlighted television features on The Home Shopping Network and are currently working on additional television marketing opportunities.
