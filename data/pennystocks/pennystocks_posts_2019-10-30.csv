How does this happen without the company going belly up and are there stocks that actually rebound up to those levels once they hit so low?",dp1mx6,catfarmersdaughter87,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dp1mx6/new_of_course_hoping_to_understand_could_some/,1,0,,2019-10-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dp1mx6/new_of_course_hoping_to_understand_could_some/

**ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / October 30, 2019 /** Aureus, Inc. (OTC PINK:ARSN) (""Aureus"" or the ""Company"") ([www.AureusNOW.com](http://pr.report/zNsDliTC)) an emerging leader in the food brand development industry which owns the Yuengling's Ice Cream brand (""Yuengling's Ice Cream"" or ""Yuengling's"") ([www.yuenglingsicecream.com](http://pr.report/UQ0i7nsc)) including all intellectual property and its distribution at select retail locations. Recently completed an agreement with Waterside Capital Advisors, Inc. This is the latest addition to the investment banking team to work alongside, Hannover International, as capital markets advisors.

The principal of Waterside, Billy Hayde, is a veteran in the venture capital markets, with strong ties to the food and beverage industry. Mr.Hayde will assist Aureus in raising $5-$6mm in equity to expand the footprint of Yuengling's and complete an acquisition that Aureus has been working on. Mr. Hayde also has a long relationship with the principals of Hanover.

In related news, Aureus has engaged the services of Hanover International, Inc. (""Hanover"") ([http://www.hanoverintlinc.com/](http://pr.report/TPwq5KMc)) as capital markets advisors. The highly regarded firm, with offices in California and New York, was founded in 1990 to help companies with ""defining and implementing effective capital formation, new business development and institutional shareholder relations strategies."" Hanover offers a deep pool of capital markets expertise from which to advise the company in fine tuning its messaging platform to facilitate greater capital markets access.

""These are significant developments relating to our ability to expand the business and transition from the Regulation A financing we are currently employing"" said Everett Dickson, CEO of Aureus, Inc. ""Institutional funding is a key component to real growth and stock support. This will also help us move away from traditional funding avenues which are more dilutive and even toxic. Additionally, we can continue to grow effectively and bring maximum value to our shareholders. We are looking at the big picture and want to complete with the bigger players in the sector. Be on the lookout for an 8K/PR, as stated in our recent tweet.""",2019-10-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dpaqyy/arsn_aureus_inc_continues_to_build_investment/

I have about 125,000 shares in this company that I bought years ago. They were something like .10 a share. For the people who do this all the time, what does it mean when a company tanks below .oooooo1 a share, but it goes up and down by 100%, while never breaking a penny? Is this common with rip off scams? Luckily I didn't spend much. Thanks.",2019-10-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dpc8u4/futl_can_anyone_explain_why_a_penny_stock_will/
