Not every biotech abuses their shareholders like that. With the worlds richest man behind it, I don’t think they need to raise cash. Knock on wood. With that said, MM’s probably have their price target in mind, you just saw people jump in and collaborate their tooling of the share price on Friday. The momentum could and likely will continue up. Of course it could pull back slightly first to fill the gap is just made jumping up. Overall I’m bullish on it because I was in the trade last time it darted up to $8.

Even if it is not this week, I have an alert set to let me know if/when the stock is testing the 4 level.

MNK Chart setup:  [https://imgur.com/zlnjEOd](https://imgur.com/zlnjEOd) 

NIO - I have an alert set for breakout over 2.50

SRNE - could squeeze again if can build over 3.

NVAX - needs to clear 5

SSI - also need to clear 5 for chance at another leg higher. It will also be a good short when they're done with it.

ASLN - on the list, but no bias. We'll see where it opens and how the order book flows.

So you believe in books but don't believe in a course? What if that course was developed by an author? Or if a book you've read was based on a course?

Why should we offer you connections? What value would you bring to that connection?

Surrounding yourself with profitable traders is a great way to go. But do you think the good ones just give away most of their ideas/concepts and live trades without wanting some compensation, even if its lunch/beer? Not to mention that strategies and market conditions change. The good ones know how to adapt. You need to have constant access to a mentor or group. 

If you put together your own groupthink, you'll have people with all different kinds of strategies. This can be good and bad. Good to learn new things, bad because you may lose money trying to learn their process. Everyone will think their strategy is better than the next guys.

Use Reddit, find other forums, use twitter, use facebook, use insta; but most importantly you need to develop your own playbook of strategies that works for you. It is extremely difficult to change your thought process after you think you've developed a strategy that works, but then over-time you realize it doesn't anymore. Having a group of profitable traders for real feedback is key, but be prepared to spend a little time/money to access those traders that have a similar strategy as you. 

Just don't expect someone to teach you the ropes if you don't bring value to the conversation or aren't willing to compensate them for their time after years of building their own strategies.
