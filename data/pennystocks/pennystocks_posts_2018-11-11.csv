HSGX

&amp;#x200B;

HSGX will hold half two BLA DECISION pre decision rise , sell quartier after BLA decision, and hold the rest long term . I do believe in HSGX as company in general long term. 

TTNP sell half before Wednesday and sell after decision half on Wednesday  FDA decision 

ATMN basically swing trade before fda date (possibly hold to date)

&amp;#x200B;

Any opinions on these three stocks or sell off strategy? Have only been investing small amounts into penny stocks, but I been thinking of investing a bigger pot.",2018-11-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vzawu/ive_been_trading_penny_stocks_for_last_month_done/

## How to Find the Right Company to Invest as A Day Trader

DETROIT (PENNYSTOCKS.NEWS) With the markets being really hot and with so many stories popping-up of so many successful day traders. But should you trust most of the stories? Well some have become very successful day trading in the stock market. But some are scams and are just trying to perceive themselves as people that they are not. Thus, most rookie traders follow their lead and end up blowing up their accounts. In this article I will discuss the major **mistakes and possible way to avoid making them again**.

&amp;#x200B;

## The Mistakes Rookies Make

It is not **their fault**, but most new investors follow the lead of what other **people say in groups**. People that are new in this industry do not put in the time to do their own **due diligence**. That is the most important aspect. Most rookies **don’t know what all the numbers mean**, and get confused and just follow the lead of what others. Most people get caught in a **pump and dump.** Without them even knowing about it, till it is too late and have lost most of their investment. This is mostly happens in **Over the Counter Exchange** better known as **OTC** markets. Another mistake that both experienced and rookie investors make is that they get **greedy**. Investors will see a substantial gain and would get the feeling that it will continue to go up. The **biggest mistake** investors make, **undisciplined and not taking profits**. Over time those profits will add up and cause a small account to grow to a new level.

&amp;#x200B;

$NVLN released news that its subsidiary entered into term loan agreement and provided some forecast for its subsidiary's future cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

Read news: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novelion-therapeutics-subsidiary-enters-term-134852459.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novelion-therapeutics-subsidiary-enters-term-134852459.html)

&amp;#x200B;

$NVLN price increased for two days straight with the help from the news article, released earnings and various chat rooms that touted the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, $BOXL spiked this week without any related news but as usual to these type of moves from microcap stocks, crashed the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

And as well I reviewed shippers stock trading action.
