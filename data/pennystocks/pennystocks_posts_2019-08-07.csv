11,The Next BIG Custodianship Play imho: $GRNL,cn6uja,Gc42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cn6uja/the_next_big_custodianship_play_imho_grnl/,5,7,"Don't know what a custodianship play is? Here's a helpful link: [Understanding Custodianship Plays](https://otcmarketresearch.com/understanding-custodianship-plays/)

In penny stocks, custodianship plays can (and often are) some of the biggest % winners that can be a game-changer to your account balance.Basically, an individual (custodian) takes control over an abandoned ticker, cleans up the public shell (paying off back taxes, TA fees, gets current with filings) and then finds a private company to complete a reverse merger with. A formerly abandoned shell ticker essentially enters an entirely new world and becomes a thriving business. Depending on the merging entity, these plays can be 10x+.

The guy from the article, Richard Chiang, who successfully completed the custodianship process with LCTZ (now $DEVM) is now in to his next play: $GRNL. At it's peak of 0.27 DEVM reached a market cap of $14mil, with approx. 51mil shares outstanding--$GRNL currently has an OS of just 7.2mil, and a $14mil MC would put us at close to $2 PPS! Even at DEVM's current market cap of $3mil would put us at a $0.41 PPS (conservatively).

$GRNL is in the mid to late stages of the custodianship/RM process. Chiang has been appointed Custodian, all taxes and fees owed to the state and TA have been paid. Now we are awaiting Chiang to file his final custodianship documents with the court, and then announce the reverse merger. The key to these plays is buying in BEFORE this happens. Take DEVM for example: would you rather have bought in at .012 or .20?? $GRNL will easily see DollarLand considering it's Float of 1.4mil is practically 1/10th of DEVM's 15.6mil...Don't miss your chance to Buy In Now before the party gets started next month.

 Facts for why KLY will be a massive success. 
 
This is a recap of the news releases and positive milestones by Kalytera to date. This can all be verified by news releases and numerous websites. Very easy to find. 

 Here are the facts. 
 
1.     Phase 2 of their lead product development program evaluating cannabidiol for the prevention of acute graft versus host disease has been extremely positive and encouraging. No patients in the first cohort developed grades 3 or 4 acute GVHD while receiving oral CBD treatment, and only one patient developed grade 2 acute GVHD.
 
2.     Phase 2 will likely be completed no later than October/November. To date, no patients in the medium dose cohort have developed acute GVHD of any grad. Once completed, they are planning a seamless and immediate transition into phase 3.
 
3.     Current interest from numerous pharma companies to partner or licence the GVHD drug. The business strategy Kaly is pursuing for their GVHD products is to out-license the commercial rights for these products once they have completed the Phase 2 study in prevention of GVHD. They have engaged Echelon Wealth Partners to determine the value, on a risk-adjusted basis, of its CBD therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of graft versus host disease, and to assist with the review of potential out-licensing opportunities for the commercial rights to these products.
 
4.     Kaly has invented a novel first-in-class cannabinoid molecule for treatment of acute and chronic pain, designated KAL-1816. The progress of this drug is extremely positive and the commercial opportunity is very large.
 
5.     Numerous patents on both drugs. Proprietary rights my friends.
 
6.     Kaly is acquiring a 51% stake in a state-of-the-art Clean Bi Design CBD extraction business. This will be amongst the largest such operations in the US capable of producing 600 kilograms of CBD isolate per shift, per month. On the property there is an 8000 square-foot factory built to food grade manufacturing standards and certified as food grade by the US department of Agriculture. This transaction will provide near-term path to revenues. Closing is expected to occur on or about October 1, 2019. The forcasted market for CBD is estimated to be 20 billion dollars by 2014. They expect to report initial revenues from CBD isolate sales by Q4 2019. 
 
7.     Kalytera’s new Consumer Products Division is also planning to launch an E-Commerce website that will support online sales of consumer CBD products derived from hemp, including CBD oils and other CBD consumer products. The platform will support Kalytera’s own family of brands, selling CBD wellness products to all legal CBD markets across the U.S.
