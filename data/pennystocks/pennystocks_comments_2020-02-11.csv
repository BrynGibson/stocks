131,MagicMonkeyPaw,fhd10hj,/r/pennystocks/comments/f2bz6l/favorite_technical_analysis/fhd10hj/,1,"Ok, man I'm sorry about being asshole about it this:

(if I am wrong about you being a beginner just ignore me)

Stop looking for some holy grail indicator. Indicators are crap for trading. At best they give you a very vague description of what's currently going on, but usually it's only what happened a few candles ago.

second: stop trading penny stocks. Just don't. I'm sorry for assuming things, but given the kind of questions you're asking and after a quick glance at your profile I assume you are a beginner. Trade things with large market caps that have lots of volume. It's easier. It doesn't matter that you can afford n-thousand shares of shitty cheap company. If a stock goes up 30% you make 30% on your invested capital regardless whether you paid 300 bucks or 30 cent a share. Also real companies actually go up in value unlike penny stock garbage which gets pumped and dumped and never comes back (which means you lost all your money because your idea of risk management as a beginner is 'going all in'). 

third: fuck this pattern nonsense.. There are exactly two patterns for you to care about:

1. it's trending.

2. it's not trending

when it's trending you go in and when it's not you get out. yes, there are other strategies and yes they make money but for you right now this is the absolutely easiest way. it's like a cheat code. later on you can build up on it. with enough screen time you will know when a certain situation A leads to situation B and you'll be able to formalise rules to trade these situations, but right now you are facing a sea of bullshit (the internet) and you can not tell what is good advice and what is not. (Indicator-strategies by the way: not good advice.)

read up on how Richard Dennis made his millions. Or Nicolas Darvas. Or even Jesse Livermore. They all tell you to ""buy strenght and sell weakness"" or ""buy high and sell higher"". It's a stupid simple. Remember what Gall's law:

\&gt; **A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never worksand cannot be patched up to make it work.**

fourth: Here are three things in order of importance for you to learn:

1. Risk Management
2. How to get out of a trade
3. How to get in in a trade

wait, fuck this. here's an even better list:

1. When Not To Trade
2. Not Trading
3. Hating to trade because it's fucking boring and consists of  waiting all the time

You know why Risk Management (that is position sizing) is so important? People will tell you it's because you don't want to go broke from 3 or 4 bad trades in a row (which will happen because trading is pretty much just waiting and failing all the time). They are actually right, but there's another reason: after a long enough strike of sufficiently large losses your psyche will suffer. Even the tiniest loss will stress you out. You won't be able to hold on to winning trades (because you're afraid for your profit to vanigh) and you will watch your losses pile up to incredible sums (because you hope for a reversal that'll never come). And all of this will mentally fuck you up and you'll become some kind of fucked up finance incel and your only way to get out of all of this will be to stop trading for a few month but you won't because you'll be trying to win it all back and losing even more while you feel like the retard that you actually are. This is not hyperbole. You can read this shit in every account of people describing how they blew up their account. All they get out of this is a profound understanding of what goes on in the head of a deer in the headlights. 

Anyway ... I don't want to bore you any further. Read up on trend following / momentum trading / price action ... whatever ... pretty much everything is better than indicators and penny stocks.",2020-02-11

If it is a non penny stock then it’s free for online trading and the app. Fidelity is the same. Just google “ E*TRADE fees” and same for fidelity, will be right there.",2020-02-11

173,Bubbs77,fhjbb5r,/r/pennystocks/comments/f29661/aim/fhjbb5r/,1,Good  luck in your house shopping. Building materials and labor are so high. I own 75acres so I had to build. Otherwise I would have bought land and house as a combo verses building. Fully believe you can buy a built house cheeper and I know with less headache. Just make sure you have room for a trading lair.,2020-02-11
174,Bubbs77,fhjbxju,/r/pennystocks/comments/f29661/aim/fhjbxju/,1,"Thanks, I had a good day today with ADXS and LLIT. I also missed several opportunities due to work issues. But snagging another 450 while having a bunch of pesky work distractions is not bad in my book. This week I went red Monday and pulled one out of my butt last min and ended they day 20 to the good. Tuesday through Thursday have been 400-600 green days. Last week was two red and three green. I’m still a “freshman” at this and I play very conservative. I trade in a very narrow band and usually with 4-7k invested per trade. I leave a lot of meat on the bone right now since I’m still refining my strategy but I’m about to widen the band a little and see what happens. Last time i widened  the band I went backwards but I’ve learned a lot since then. Soon I’ll Graduate to sophomore.  When I get my PHD watch out 😂😂😂",2020-02-11
