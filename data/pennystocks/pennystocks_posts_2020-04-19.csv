10,$NAT $PUMP $EROS $TRNX,g47vvz,itsmarkcarson,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g47vvz/nat_pump_eros_trnx/,1,47,"Good morning all. Here is my DD on some stonks. Google Doc didn't copy the links I attach to some of the statements so I guess you'll still have to find it on your own.

$NAT - ($4.03) Nordic American Tankers Limited, a tanker company, acquires and charters double-hull tankers in Bermuda and internationally. It operates a fleet of 23 Suezmax crude oil tankers. A single suezmax carries about 800,000 to more than 1,000,000 barrels.

NEWS:
May 18th Q1 Earning
Share buy back program is decided March 18th

CFO bought 60,000 shares @ $4.75 March 30th
EVP bought 84,000 shares @ $3.37 March 25th 
(EVP is responsible for employing tankers)
CEO‚Äôs son bought 350,000 shares @ $2.92 March 24th
New Vice Chairman March 27th
They seem to release statements pretty frequently for the past 2 months.

Volume: 2.9 million

BALANCE:
Total assets just over $1 billion. 
(129 million in current assets)
(62 million in cash)

Total liabilities $432 million
(59 million in current liabilities, 375 million in long-term debt)
(operating cost is $8,000 daily)

*2019 the company was up 135% in accounts payable.

INCOME:
2019 Gross Profit 45 million.
More recently the CEO sent a letter showing 12 current contracts from March averaging $68,500 per day extending for the next 60 days.
With the current oil climate I expect demand for tankers to increase.

Also the CEO has made it clear: ‚ÄúDividend are a priority‚Äù as it mentioned in almost every article.

Summary:
It's a go for me. This stock has seen better days at 20 million+ volume and prices well over $20. ‚Äò08 crash they saw a positive bump and ‚Äò15 they saw another one. Hoping the bump during this crash will be a spike.
Looking for stock to double in Q2. Would be confident holding longer too. Going to be buying in Monday.


$EROS - ($4.00) Eros International Plc, together with its subsidiaries, co-produces, acquires, and distributes Indian language films in various formats worldwide. News has it Eros will merge with STX Entertainment, a private company. Financial terms didn‚Äôt come out, but I would assume STX would now operate in the public legal shell of Eros. Sometimes this works &amp; sometimes the deal doesn‚Äôt go thru. Given the current market situation, STX might be using this as a quick play to go public 
Typically a merger can take 3-4 months.

Volume: 20 million

$EROS Balance Sheet:
Over $1 billion in total assets

430 million in liabilities, 200 million is current debt.

INCOME: 
114 million Gross Profit but -400 million Net Income.

Overall Eros has been on a downtrend from the start.

STX:
STX Entertainment was valued by multiple sources at $1.5 billion.
They made ‚ÄúThe Upside‚Äù with Kevin Hart. A movie I‚Äôve never heard about. Just watched the trailer, not sure what to think but let me guess, he dies at the end. $125 million box office. Budget 37.5 million.

Mile 22 - 66 million box office (lead role by Marky Mark!) budget 35 million. 21% on rotten tomatoes.
Ugly Dolls - 32 million box office. Budget 45 million. Most recent release/kids movie. 27% rotten tomatoes.
The Edge of 17 - 18 million box office. Budget was 9 million. 94% rotten tomatoes.
The Foreigner - 145 million box office. (Jackie Chan!) Budget 35 million.

Summary:
Most of their movies are profitable. Could be potential there but personally I‚Äôm not a fan of any of these movies and I don‚Äôt think Eros Bollywood audience will be either. 
Hate to be the downer but this merger play just seems like a handful of hope.
Who knows, maybe the merger goes well and the stock hits $16.79 by July.


$TRNX- ($0.34) The company offers MagneGas, a hydrogen-based synthetic fuel that is used as an alternative to acetylene and other natural gas derived fuels for metal cutting and other commercial uses. It also provides Plasma Arc Flow System for MagneGas production, or water decontamination and sterilization. In addition, the company sells and licenses its proprietary plasma arc technology.

News:
Taronis had previously been notified of a minimum bid deficiency, given relief until June 30th to hit $1.00.
Company decided against a reverse split! Good news, they must be confident! Could just be a pump tho right?

Volume: 697 million
This has dummy momentum.

Hold on a second, this stock was once traded for $26,000???? I don‚Äôt know about that. Look at the 5 year chart.

Balance:
27 million in assets, almost no cash.
4 million in liabilities. 

Income:
Gross profit: 8 million
Net Income: -24 million

Summary:
This company hasn‚Äôt been profitable in years.
Not liking the way these numbers are looking.
Read rumors somewhere that Taronis Technology is licensing patents to Taronis Fuel. 
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something here. It's a no go for me.

$PUMP - ($3.50) (+25% on Friday) ProPetro Holding Corp., an oilfield services company, provides pressure pumping and other related services. The company offers hydraulic fracturing services; and a suite of well completion and production services, including cementing, acidizing, coiled tubing, flowback, surface air drilling, and drilling services. 
What struck my interest was oil field maintenance &amp; services. 

News:
Earning Date May 5th
Stockholder rights plan April 14th. Mentions the rights the shareholders would have if the company happens to get bought out in the next year. 
Investigation on behalf of stockholders April 11th

Volume: 3 million

Balance:
1.4 billion in total assets, 149 million cash.
446 million total liabilities, 232 million current liabilities.

Income:
436 million Gross Profit
163 million Net Income

Summary:
I‚Äôm already in at $3.34. Might get out before the earning date and get back in after.

You'll notice a pattern though... The ones that have a high % of being fake are the ones that are posted from the website of the trading platform that they use. You can easily edit the information on the trading Platform websites. You would need to use Photoshop to Fake the ones from the Desktop/Mobile app itself.

You can also catch certain details that could provide more proof that their Website ""Gains"" are not real. For instance when a Number that is in the thousands doesn't even have a Comma(,) . I have not seen a website itself not have the comma in there, unless it's been human error.

These are just a few examples though on what to look out for, some people can be creative it seems in ""faking it"", so be careful out there.",2020-04-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g491j0/how_to_determine_someone_might_be_fake_trading/

* MACD signal close to MACD, but looks like it's trending to move above
* Higher than average volume since about 4/9
