0,Weekend homework 3-10-18,83jlh7,glitchygal,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83jlh7/weekend_homework_31018/,2,4,"So I‚Äôm looking at the top 50 OTC companies list from 1-18 based on 2017.  Out of those 50 about 12 are ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù ARREF, IMMVF, MBAIF, OPCO, EXMGF, CRECF, CORVF, NMKEF, CBGDF, NGPHF, REPR and OMCN

EXMGF interests me a lot because it‚Äôs tied in with the same company as JetMF and the management people almost seem more excited about it than jet sometimes.  

ARREF is @ .82 with a target of 1.60

CBGDF is @5.10 and very recently had its target price  raised to 9.13

So I have other things to do now but trying to make up my mind on my favorites.  If anyone has anything to add please do.  ",2018-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83jlh7/weekend_homework_31018/

Company expects to be profitable and self sufficient for first time ever this quarter. Seems real easy with the rise of production and raise of oil price. Also quite a few new wells drilled and we should know about them soon. VP just dropped 400k on shares. He wouldn‚Äôt do that without knowing something! 

Every one of their board members has purchased shares in the last two weeks. Also the company is doing a share buyback so we shouldn‚Äôt see any more dips. Up from here 

Check out all the links I posted in the Robin Hood penny stocks page. I made a similar post but backed it up with a ton of DD! ",2018-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83n1wq/gte/

10,$HCEI - before the croud,83p6lt,WonkyWombat321,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/83p6lt/hcei_before_the_croud/,16,6,"Chasing the daily pump is a great way to lose your shirt when the group gets bored and moves on to the next one (while you can be a profitable trader from this approach substantially more traders will lose $$). I'm here to recommend a pick of mine which is not trending and doesn't have much interest at this point, but it's potential is considerable and the risk profile is low. This is how you make money in the OTC, patience. 


‚Ä¢	184m float (valued at $404k based on last closing price of .0022)

‚Ä¢	CEO is independently wealthy, well educated, and has not been involved in any prior P&amp;D penny stock scams

‚Ä¢	Financially solid with positive equity and net income (unheard of in penny land at these levels)

‚Ä¢	No dilution in over 2 years (not that it would be needed from a profitable company anyway)

‚Ä¢	Trades very thin (review the chart to see how often this one pops)

‚Ä¢	Company submitted their first filing in 2 years in early February to get CE removed (CE is only in place due to IHUB pump group ran this several months back). This process typically takes 1-2 months and therefore is likely close to fruition.


The price popped after filings hit OTC Markets, but it has since returned to discounted prices. Given management has been quiet for over 2 years I would say it‚Äôs safe to assume there is a very good reason they‚Äôve decided to spend $$ to have CE removed and get current again. As always rumors are swirling about the reason behind the filings, I won‚Äôt speculate, or try to sell some grand get rich quick expectations, and instead let you make up your own mind.

 Reread the above bullet points and I just ask you to reflect on how many other stocks in the OTC can you name with a float under $500k with such an exceptional risk/reward?
