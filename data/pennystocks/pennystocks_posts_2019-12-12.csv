**Rift Valley Resources Corp. Announces Commencement of Construction of First Wireless Broadband Network in Crockett, Texas** 

**December 12 2019 -** Vancouver, B.C. **Rift Valley Resources Corp (the “Company”) (CSE: RVR)** **–** announces that the Company, through its subsidiary Ruralink Wireless (“Ruralink”) has begun construction of its wireless broadband network located in Crockett Texas, the first of a proposed 130  regional rural networks throughout the US, representing a market of over 44 million people.

It is estimated that there are over 160 million people, primarily in rural areas in the USA, who have limited or no access to true broadband internet connectivity.

Ruralink has teamed with ARK Multicasting, Inc. (“ARK”) which controls 280 TV licenses in the US to create its new Hybrid Broadcast Broadband network. Of these, 130 television licenses are in rural markets, providing substantial coverage to the targeted rural residential, enterprise and government facilities.

The parties will conduct a two-phase pilot program in Crockett, Texas to leverage the use of licensed TV broadcast spectrum with unlicensed TVWS radio spectrum to create a highly efficient and cost-effective solution providing wireless broadband (“last mile”) internet access in rural areas.  

Crockett, Texas will be one of the first markets served by Ruralink. Upon completion of successful trials, Ruralink will move to expand its footprint and regions served with its unique approach of the mixing of mature and disruptive technologies to serve these communities, such as those brought by ARK Multicasting to finally deliver on the long overdue promise of true broadband internet connectivity to rural markets.
