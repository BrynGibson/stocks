0,Scanner/trading software?,9a4wkk,dutchmanriver,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/,12,15,"I currently have a account with fidelity because I have a stock purchase plan through my job. $5 a trade seems reasonable. Don’t like their scanner at all. 

I was wondering what software for scanning/identifying stocks everyone uses? I know about think or swim but I don’t have $3500 to open the account like they are currently asking for. Any others out there that work well? Any screener tips? ",2018-08-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9a4wkk/scannertrading_software/
