I’m extremely pleased to report that the first half of 2018 has been a record period for Animoca Brands. We recorded our highest half-year income ($8.4 million), our highest cash receipts ($6 million), and our first profitable half-yearly period ($1.69 million). Moreover, we ended the half with $2 million in cash and raised another $6 million just after the half, so our financial position today is the strongest it’s ever been.

Animoca Brands now has a leading position in blockchain gaming, an industry-leading library of licensed IP, and deep resources in AI and machine learning technologies, all of which we believe position us to take advantage of the next evolutionary stages of mobile entertainment.""",2018-08-31
