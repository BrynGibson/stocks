1,QUESTION?,dm8fqh,evincb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dm8fqh/question/,2,2,Is there somewhere I can filter for news on stocks? I’ve been looking at trade ideas and going back months and researching stocks and what made them pop. It’s very interesting that most of these stocks have very similar news. They have similar wording and even certain words in most. I have a journal that I’ve kept the ones I’ve found interesting in. I picked one from each day starting the beginning of this year. Anyone know somewhere you can filter through news for keywords?,2019-10-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dm8fqh/question/

As per usual with many stocks getting FDA approval, there was a price drop from what I'm assuming is a stop loss raid. But at the time I'm posting, volume is about 330,000, which seems to be on the low side when these things usually happen. Does anybody have an explanation? Shouldn't volume be a lot higher in this instance?",2019-10-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dmhlqs/mlnt/
