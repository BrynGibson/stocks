0,You Could Be Making More From Penny stocks,b0gfyo,WaxuTutu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b0gfyo/you_could_be_making_more_from_penny_stocks/,317,61,"When I was first learning the loops of the stock market I stumbled into this subreddit hoping to profit from small investments. I took the advice I saw in here because I had no clue what I was doing. I lost a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

I've learnt do day trade since then and have since earned back all the money I lost and am on the path to becoming a full time day trader. Gains from day trading penny stocks can be up to 100 dollars a day trading with a 1,500 dollar account. Day trading strategies as you get used to them also put you in a position where you can choose to trade with a high winning percentage. Long term investing is more of a gamble because some companies despite having good fundamentals may take over a decade to be noticed. Don't you want to profit now? Time and effort invested in to learning day trading strategies can and will earn you a lot of money if you stick with it. I've put some resources below for those who will heed my warning.

Notice that LEAS is marked as never having been a shell on the newest form? It's clearly a shell.

https://www.procopio.com/uploads/model/Block/6364/pdf/561/Cleary_Rule144.pdf

As defined in Rule 405 and Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a ‚Äúshell company‚Äù is a company that is now, or at any time previously was, a company with no or nominal operations, and any one of the following:
no or nominal assets;
‚Ä¢ assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
‚Ä¢ assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and other nominal assets

History:
""In the attorney letter, Paradiso stated that Poe was not an affiliate and BHGI was never a shell company (both untrue facts) so the share didn‚Äôt have to be registered to be free trading. The free trading shares were issued on January 6, 2015. Thanks to the 50,000,000 service shares being issued to Palm Desert Management Inc, the 5,081,734 shares issued to Global Force Trading Limited came out to 9.99% of the O/S. It is obvious that the 50,000,000 shares were more about raising the O/S to support larger debt conversions by James Poe than about anything else. ""

(‚ÄúTruCrowd‚Äù). This, to further DigitalAMN‚Äôs increased support of Regulation CF (Reg. CF equity crowdfunding ‚Äì Title III of the JOBS Act) as part of the Company‚Äôs PAI ecosystem.

‚ÄúWith additional assistance, TruCrowd will have the ability to expand the reach of both its cannabis-focused portal Fundanna.com, as well as CryptoLaunch \[focused on startups developing crypto and/or blockchain related ventures\], while also being able to develop and launch other industry-specific equity crowdfunding portals, in areas such as music, biotech and clean energy,‚Äù stated Ajene Watson, CEO of Digital Asset Monetary Network.¬† ‚ÄúBy increasing our overall interest in TruCrowd, we‚Äôd both protect and help ensure the continued growth of our investment, which has already seen an [estimated 15x increase in value](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rtMqxW1ji9uUaLTgY5axqM2UX-seQYpPuF14IkUmq_BS4a8lFhZ5C9Js3C7u2tRJU2sbwqoA35lj2sE17vwmjp7J7RkM9ffBhvradVtI3md3_42U3QYoqlbcwRObEC_CfT0-9mm8iQbH8tUc-8wNGKSb4ZE65E3JISP1Yd5A_tRI1HpQqrpa9b2Kq-sWJ9f1xNc2Tt39KJrHurQxowVh4veKq24Q6EgWsKsXxXm8c1E2KbUItGLC1aol-k0xqw9RQdilik4az1fMOBRWOR3Nt-WjI2cNec7dVe_TTX_wKNM=). This, while strengthening the infrastructure of the PAI ecosystem, making us a viable platform for startups and everyday people to transact.‚Äù

Management believes that as TruCrowd continues to emerge as an industry leader in equity crowdfunding, DATI‚Äôs value and position as a market leader in the accelerator and incubator marketplace will simultaneously improve. Likewise, DigitalAMN‚Äôs client-companies will likely be able to raise more money, faster and more efficiently; thereby supporting DATI‚Äôs revenue model, while building stronger shareholder confidence.¬†

DigitalAMN plans on (i) injecting roughly 2x to 5x more capital into equity crowdfunding during 2019 than in 2017 and 2018 combined, and (ii) provide an array of services to assist with further development of the equity crowdfunding model. Investments may include additional office space, human capital and equity, professional/consulting services, cash for operations and marketing; as well as possibly expanding the portal operator‚Äôs relationship with InvestorsHub.com, Inc. and other prominent advertising platforms.

Watson concluded, ‚ÄúWhen an investment makes a 15x contribution to the increased value of our equity portfolio, which also happens to be of [greater value than our entire average market cap (year-to-date)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DeEx2Dn9F_gmLl0kof3JFe-LagHAdGbOsL2oKa-7juoRIpebvKD4pkzPMC5DtCSgZ6IzBN2-u8kwuONdCotUzRqMl-5nXqGWqiPwqIlaQ4jylS8FjaeBvHzB0u9Bban_c4Hubx1utqXGti2M6CAahUrUYWIE7NuFc8tuzpZzJmH95EfGvm9hwYkQasvPUAfshhKaQfaVIw7EFIQQMFYmuPfykNYRRIXMiiOlLfZtwjDqZK0pAA61fXM-DEYBAK7iw7Nef-ApKaSQ-SleWpGrs6GLInZaXy9gX-cO4RzLu0dOMV59NBRCHrtmpedMnNsc), we‚Äôd be absolutely foolish not to pay close attention to the Reg.

‚ÄúTruCrowd‚Äôs estimated enterprise value has grown approximately 3000% since becoming a DigitalAMN equity portfolio company and its portals play an equally important role in the development of DigitalAMN‚Äôs PAI ecosystem, as it does to the growing value of our equity portfolio and revenue model. Remember, our client-companies, most of which will ultimately become part of DATI‚Äôs equity portfolio, will likely raise their first significant round of capital via equity crowdfunding. Their second, more significant round, could be via a Reg. A+. In both cases, utilizing TruCrowd‚Äôs portals. Most important, both capital raises support the client-company‚Äôs ability to execute their business plan and pay DigitalAMN for its ongoing services.‚Äù

The overall increase in DigitalAMN‚Äôs interest in TruCrowd should result in the current investment relationship transitioning into a formal client-company arrangement ‚Äì aggressively moving TruCrowd through the accelerate phase and into the incubate phase of DigitalAMN‚Äôs four-phase process \[Accelerate, Incubate, Acquire, Spinout\].",2019-03-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b0p9ay/dati_digital_asset_monetary_network_to_increase/

21,Imaging3 (OTCMKTS:IGNG) Signs Letter of Intent for Reverse Acquisition by CA Cannabis Company,b0n934,lagefut,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b0n934/imaging3_otcmktsigng_signs_letter_of_intent_for/,28,11,"Burbank, CA, March 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG, ‚ÄúImaging3‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a development stage company introducing disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, today announced that it has executed a non-binding letter of intent (‚ÄúLOI‚Äù) to be acquired in a reverse acquisition (the ‚ÄúAcquisition‚Äù) by a privately held Los Angeles based cannabis company (the ‚ÄúAcquirer‚Äù).

           John Hollister, CEO of Imaging3, explained the intersection of this opportunity with the Company‚Äôs objectives for development and commercialization of its Dominion‚Ñ¢ 3D X-ray imaging technology: ‚ÄúWe have continued our progress towards our targeted closure of approximately $3M of funding for our Dominion development program which we anticipate to close in the near future. A critical step in this process is the resolution of certain outstanding obligations owed by the Company. We believe that the proposed Acquisition announced today will help us to more easily resolve these obligations, thereby allowing the Dominion to devote a substantially larger percentage of the anticipated $3M funding to future endeavors as opposed to existing obligations. Conducting the Dominion enterprise in a new private entity will also eliminate the not insignificant costs of being a public entity.‚Äù

              Hollister continued: ‚ÄúAs many of us observe on a daily basis, the healthcare benefits and investment opportunities in CBD and other cannabis-derived products has been the focus of significant attention to investors of every genre. We believe that the Acquirer has wisely positioned itself to be a responsible leader in this emerging field, focusing on regulatory compliance and product quality as the drivers behind a well-planned rollup and integration of multiple facets of the cannabis business. The Acquisition of our fully-reporting and SEC current public company improves their access to the public equity markets and should facilitate their ability to rapidly attract either debt or equity financing and maximize value appreciation and liquidity for their investors and the current IGNG public shareholder. For the above reasons, IGNG‚Äôs officers and directors sincerely believe that the Acquisition is in the best interest of all parties: Imaging3‚Äôs current shareholders, the myriad financial and health care beneficiaries of the roll out of our breakthrough Dominion imaging technology, and the Acquirer.‚Äù

             The Acquirer holds licenses issued by the State of California to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in California. The Acquirer commenced operations in mid-2018 and has enjoyed more than $550,000.00 in revenue from operations since they commenced. The Acquirer maintains facilities in Riverside County California near Palm Springs. On Thursday, March 7, 2019 the Acquirer obtained its final permit and clearance from the local fire department to commence operation of an ethanol-based extraction laboratory at its facilities, and will initiate related extraction and post-processing operations as soon as practicable. The Acquirer‚Äôs laboratory will be able to extract CBD hemp under Federal law pursuant to the recently signed 2018 Farm Act that classifies CBD hemp as an insurable commodity.

            Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and the Acquirer have initiated negotiations intended to result in completion and execution of a definitive equity exchange agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) defining all of the material terms of the Acquisition on or before March 31, 2019. Per the LOI, the Agreement shall provide that upon conclusion of the Acquisition, the Acquirer‚Äôs designees shall own 80% of the then outstanding common shares of the Company and the Company‚Äôs current shareholders shall own 20% of such outstanding common shares. The Company will also be required to settle the above mentioned outstanding creditor obligations on terms acceptable to both the Acquirer and the Company. Furthermore the Acquirer is required to obtain a commitment for a bridge loan of not less than $1,250,000.00 to be funded at the closing of the Acquisition and an equity infusion of up to $10,000,000.00 subsequent to closing of the transaction, each from a qualified investor(s), both of which will be applied to the growth of the Acquirer‚Äôs cannabis enterprises.

            Concomitantly with the successful closing of the Acquisition, all rights to the Company‚Äôs intellectual property, assets and funding raised relating to its Dominion imaging technology will be assigned and transferred to a new, private closely-held company (‚Äúthe Dominion Company‚Äù) to be owned by post-Acquisition IGNG, the Acquirer‚Äôs designees, current IGNG management and board members, and certain other persons currently associated with the Company, as finally negotiated by all of the parties to the Agreement. The Dominion Company will thereafter execute its business plan as previously articulated in IGNG‚Äôs periodic reports to the SEC separately from the cannabis operation.

            The Company‚Äôs Chairman of the Board, Jeffrey N. Peterson, offered additional perspective: ‚ÄúThe Company‚Äôs management and board have diligently prepared for completion of our planned financing of the Dominion enterprise, and the execution of our vision for an important new value proposition addressing many under-served markets for 3D X-ray imaging technology. The explosion of investor interest in the cannabis space presented us with an unusual opportunity to leverage the asset of our fully-reporting, SEC current public company structure through the serendipitous confluence of these events which we believe strengthen our likelihood to achieve our vision for the Dominion technology, while at the same offering our current IGNG shareholders a valuable opportunity for rapid appreciation of their investment in the post-Acquisition cannabis-focused company.‚Äù
