So allow me to do what I do best and dust you intellectually-

AUMN has a low P/E ratio that has been slowly rising. This information can be used to determine if the stock price is undervalued and a candidate for a breakout cycle. Not all stocks with an increasing P/E are about to enter a breakout cycle however, so you have to factor in many important variables to consider what potential you're dealing with. I've been taught to apply 4 rules to the stock in question and have yet to get shit on for following them. *knock on wood* In these cases you want proof of these 4 occurances: 

Does the stock. . .
1. have flat earnings or a growth trend over the years?
2.  have price increasing consistantly over 24 weeks?
3. have a Rank One or Two Buy rating? (if you use advising sites- but, like, why wouldn't you?)
4. average a 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000?

Meeting these criteria means that the stock has an expectionally increased potential to outperform. It should be noted as well that when calculating something like consistent increase you should make sure that the past 12 weeks worth of increase is 20% higher than or equal to the price change for 24 weeks. IMPORTANT NOTE: A jump of over 100% should be considered dangerous because further increase is highly unlikely and such a dramatic increase usually indicates the stock is due for a reversal. 

AUMN meets these requirements. Even after reporting a 4Q loss and slumps on prices for materials like Iron ore, AUMN continues to perform in an upward trend with a projected 25% EPS Growth (F1). 

I bought my shares at .38 with a current aim at .50 for about a 31% profit. Will it make me a millionaire or make me quit my schooling/job? Hell no, but I'm currently expecting to make an extra $1,000 or so which trumps throwing darts in the dark like I see so many of you do on this sub-reddit. Not to mention this is just one of my current 10 investments, and one of the smaller ones at that. 

So there. Get owned random stranger, I sure wasted time better spent studying- I mean- I sure showed you! This single post is more than I have ever posted since I've even joined this site. I will now return to never talking and silent judgements of strangers. Good luck to everyone in their endevors, I wholeheartedly wish you the best!

Personal Note: I'm self taught on all of my financial/economical/business knowledge. Considering that info you should never make any decision based on my opinion alone, not even I dare do that. If I had to quantify it; A 3rd of my knowledge actually comes from education services provided by Zacks.com, another 3rd from reading top ranked books in the industry and the last 3rd from my step-father whom makes a living as a top ranked financial/business adviser.
