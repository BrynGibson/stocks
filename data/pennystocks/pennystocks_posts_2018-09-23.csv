Imagination TV is one to look at for eoy 2018 especially now that MJ is on a rally IMTV has a tiny footprint in the MJ bizz. How? They are the sole owners of [mjbbb.org](https://mjbbb.org) wtf right? Well it's theirs and it's targeting US based states consumers that are looking for dispensary reviews. Is the bbb associated with this? Not sure but it should attract penny investors. Other recent news from them was an announcement of a ""Share Buyback"" coming. I'm on the sideline for now awaiting news from them in the form of anything. Good luck.",2018-09-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9i4k5e/imtv_below_0005/
