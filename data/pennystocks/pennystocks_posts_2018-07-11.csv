MTSL - This is a stock that will most likely crash by tomorrow morning. It jumped a significant amount during afterhours trading, so I don't expect it to go up much higher due to the laws of supply and demand.

2,$TGLO the comeback kid,8xveog,potatoclump,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/,20,20,"Hello all,

Today I will be taking you through an analysis of an ongoing speculative play regarding the famously infamous ticker $TGLO.

Now, I know this situation has been brought up on this board one, maybe two times, but that's neither here nor there and to be fair there have been some new developments anyways, so forgive the redundancy of making a new thread.

Well earlier this year, actually more toward the close of 2017, a tremor was felt deep in the cracks of the world of penny stocks. The dirt shook, the earth cried, and out sprouted new growth. The growth was surprising because this once dead organism known as TheGlobe.com had found new life.

Its facilitator, Michael S. Egan, had been patiently and carefully tending to the former IPO behemoth, a slave to his previously fruitful venture into the internet business craze. If you'd like to know more about what happened with the $TGLO IPO I recommend reading up on it. You can probably learn a thing or two about the crooks and setups that occur in this section of the market.

But this analysis isn't actually about $TGLO. It's about an LNG company called Delfin Midstream, Inc.

Now, I hear you saying, ""Why even bring up this dotcom relic if you're talking about a completely different company?"" Well I'll tell you why. During our last winter lull, when the markets finally took some time to cool off, a watchful eye spotted a golden opportunity.

Enter Frederick Jones.

Frederick Jones has been in the energy business for a number of years. People who speak his name dribble oil out of their mouths as a physical adherence to the testament of his legacy. He first came up big when he founded the very successful venture Glencore Inc. Today Glencore is in different hands but is still around at a towering market cap of $46bil. You can read a brief synopsis of his career here as well as find more information about what Delfin is trying to accomplish:

http://lngamericas.cwclng.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fred-Jones-and-Matthew-Weil.pdf

Earlier this year, Frederick Jones, along with a man named William Nichols bought a 70.9% stake in the shell company $TGLO. This sent the stock price soaring from .0001 to .03 and then another .27 soon after that once the news reached the ears of penny flippers who sought to slaughter the proverbial pig.

Since then, there has been wild speculation about the direction of the shell company with Delfin now at the helm. The most frequent speculative idea thrown about was that of the fabled Reverse Merger.

Now I can see some people leaving the room shaking their heads. And I know, I know. You're thinking it's too good to be true. And I thought so too but being the poor piece of dirt I am, I acquired a small manageable stake in the shell OTC $TGLO in February. Hoping to strike it rich, I decided to keep a close eye on this possible diamond in the rough.

And along the way, a few clues dropped out of the woodwork as well as some mysteries that are still unsolved thus far.

In their first report since the transaction in January, the shell released a filing that mentioned Delfin over 40+ times. Essentially, the filing was representative of Delfin as if they had already taken over the shell company with intent to use. But this was still speculation. Another factor that was noted by a team of individuals on a separate board was that in that same filing, there were clauses that mentioned NASDAQ listing requirements and compliance thereof. These were low in frequency and really amounted to not much more than an increase in speculation of what was to become of the shell.

This speculation was chaotic as one side said even if the company were to use the shell, they would only use it to raise money then drop it at an instant. Or that they would r/s the stock into oblivion and beyond with something akin to a 100:1 r/s leaving current shareholders holding the bag before the big bang.

The other side said there had to be something more to the whole thing and remained hopefully optimistic. They saw clippings of information bleeding through the pages of the filings. Coded legal speak that hinted at shares being held elsewhere out of reportable view. There were transactions between investors involved with TGLO and Delfin that seemed like equity trading hands. There are very few filings out for TGLO since the incident this past winter so I encourage you to read through and follow the development of the situation for yourself so as to contribute to the discussion.

But last week, something happened.

A form 4 was released stating that the interim CEO William Nichols of Fairwood LNG (previously the parent company of Delfin Midstream LLC) had resigned from his position and the Delfin CEO Fred Jones was to take his place.

In addition to this filing, we found out that Delfin Midstream LLC had changed its corporate status to a corporation and was now Delfin Midstream Inc.

This important detail allows Delfin to be a publicly traded company on a major exchange. Further building on the speculation that an uplisting is to occur at some point.

Finally, two new directors appeared in a form 13D that was filed last week. These two directors were men from Enbridge Energy (a Canadian energy investments company, worth looking up) and Talisman seen here:

https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/sec-filings/12848976/content/html

The rapid development leads some to believe that the RM super 8k announcement could be imminent. But again, this is purely speculative and definitely open to criticism. There is a lot more information out there about the supposed transaction between Enbridge and Michael Egan's fund (which amount to a 5% equity stake for around 22million shares at $3.75).


Now to the juicy fruit. What would happen if Delfin were to RM into the TGLO shell?

Assuming a modest to 0 ratio reverse split, we can speculate on the potential of a small investment in the OTC shares.

If we compare Delfin’s situation to its closest competitor in the industry, we can arrive at a fair valuation.

TELL set alarms off on some peoples radars a year and a half ago when they did a reverse merger of their own. They are still in the permitting process but have come up with a FID which I believe is to be financed in part by Golar LNG who will be helping to build the vessels for their LNG exports. I honestly haven’t read up too much on TELL but I do know that they have not acquired a permit for their exports and are still around 5-6 years off from making their first export voyage. TELL currently trades with a market cap of $2bil. At their peak, post RM, the market cap hit around $4.5billion.

Again, assuming we can compare the two companies based on their current situations, we can arrive at a similar valuation for Delfin.

Delfin has already acquired a permit for LNG export. Their permit is special however because Delfin is the only LNG export company that has permission from the United States DoE to export LNG to countries outside of a free-trade agreement with the US. This allows Delfin to reach a significantly larger global market than its competitors and to be honest, it’s hard to even place a value on a priceless permit such as theirs. To not be wildly over-optimistic, I won’t overinflate their valuation on this fact.

Delfin has also secured contracts with several countries already, two of the major players being China and Poland who combined provide about $10bil of future revenue to Delfin should their project be seen through as they would envision it.


Delfin is currently awaiting its FID but presuming that things go smoothly and are underway within the timeline they have set out thus far, I think it is fair to say that Delfin could reach at least the valuation of TELL. I believe they could easily double TELL’s peak valuation but even if they only reach a modest $2billion, the ROI of your shares if invested today could potentially net a 3,000% return. This is of course assuming there will be no r/s which there has been much discussion around. No one has a solid argument as to whether or not that will happen at any point but the general consensus is that if a r/s were to take place, they would need to dilute current shareholders to about 1/30th their current ownership which would nullify the return just mentioned.


I believe Delfin could reach a peak valuation initially of around $12billion. I think they have more contracts in their back pocket and since they have already secured some financing and now have Enbridge on their board of directors, I don’t see them having a problem financing the rest of the project through to completion in 2021/2022.

A $12 billion valuation would net a 18,500% return on shares owned today.




Will it happen? Probably not but if you’re looking for penny stocks it’s probably because you’re a degenerate hype suckler and this stock is looking like a story to tell one way or the other. There is plenty more information in the news and in filings about Delfin so I encourage you to read all of it before making any type of decision for yourself.

So here’s what I have to say now:

BIOAQ took a hit yesterday so it is a perfect time to buy. The company still has a long way to go and in my opinion should be valued at around .07 cents. However, while I highly suggest you buy this stock now and sell it in a few weeks, there is other news. The company is redesigning itself with the new management. If you look at this balance sheet, they have cleared lots of debt (putting some into long term debt) and been able to not only get back on their feet, but also start sprinting ahead. https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/bioaq/financials?query=balance-sheet As a day trader myself, I see a lot of potential in this stock and truly believe it has the chance of being the next Apple after the complete restructure. Just for some background, the company creates Succinic Acid for the cheapest price. Recently they were able to drastically reduce their spending putting them ahead of the competition. They have been offered buyouts and are really denting the big companies. This acid is becoming more and more popular as it is used in many skin care treatments and is still being explored for how it can be used. In fact, it has been recently been found that it can also be used in animal feed expanding the market for its use. The uses keep going up and so does the value. Hopefully this helps and if anyone has a question or needs clarification put it in the comments.",2018-07-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8xxiwp/watch_this_stock/
