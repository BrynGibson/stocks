They're also going to be functioning as a host for Chinese Crypto-mining company CanoePool to get into deregulated American crypto-mining. This is advantageous for SANP because China is threatening to kill their Crypto-market. SANP gets money from Crypto and will likely become a niche forerunner for entry-level crypto investors to get in the game. There's a lot of promise. But again, there are a lot of impatient speculators. My thinking is only invest what you're willing to lose. I put $370 in. Worst case, I lose half of my Christmas bonus. No big deal.

I look at these stocks in 2 ways.
1. Looking to turn a quick buck. If I think I can turn a 30% profit in a few days, a week, whatever I will buy, set a target price and sell at that target. If it keeps going up, oh well I made money and am happy with it. 
2. Do I think a stock has long term potential. I will buy smaller amounts and hold them long term.

Sometimes I get into a stock for short term, then after following for a while really believe that it has significant long term potential. In this case I will sell a good amount, get back my total original investment plus a little and have some left that essentially cost me nothing.  

I did this with NSPR, I bought 5000 shares, sold 4000 shares in 30 days when shares were up 25%. I made all of my original investment back + a little extra and have 1000 shares left which are now worth double the original pps.  Original investment $665, sold and got $691 after fees, 1000 shares left now worth $265. That I will sit on and see what happens.",2018-01-09
