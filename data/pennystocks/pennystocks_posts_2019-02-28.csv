So I figure since this person is ok with torching money, id just ask the pennystocks sub for some picks and go with that. Something waiting on fda approval or something weed related in particular was requested.  Oh, and I was supposed to do the dd for these picks before the end of the month which is fairly amusing as well since I dont really follow stocks at the moment, hence the request!

This stock is in the absolute shitter right now but this company update looks promising for the future. A few bullet points:

- Get the company reporting with 2 years of audit for pink current, then onto the other OTC markets.

- Expected revenue $15 million for year 2019, whereas 2018 was only ~$1 million.

- Multiple 2018 acquisitions and one supposed to be announced next week will at to revenue for 2019

The dilution issue has been addressed but unfortunately there won‚Äôt be any splits or buybacks for a couple quarters until they start building hard revenue, which is understandable.

It was called to our attention that the 8k report opposed this quote, as it shows we did indeed gain a bit more of convertible debt. So I just wanted to reach out let you know that  an opportunity arose to redeem  the last  issue of Series C Preferred before the right to convert to common stock became exercisable. The price was right and ABCO Energy, Inc. had most of it available from operations, but fell short and were able to find a convertible loan with excellent terms to fill the gap in the redemption  price. We now  have 6 months to redeem this new note so we should continue to have a respite on conversions.
