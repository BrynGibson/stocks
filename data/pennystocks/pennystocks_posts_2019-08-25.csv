3,SubPenny Stocks To Watch This Week,cveofj,jameson62,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cveofj/subpenny_stocks_to_watch_this_week/,7,1,"Noticing continuation in above-average volume. Some interesting price movement and at least a tiny bit of news/corporate filing interest for [CBBT, XREG, and CDIX](https://capitalmarket.exchange/Top3Under05). Also got the initial idea from that article.

I am really not digging XREG....CBBT that authorized increase and ""cooincidental"" promissory note expiry coming up has me a bit gunshy....CDIX news appears positive but again cannabis is getting hammered lately. Not really sure where I would put 100% of the focus.

Has anyone found any other information out there about any of these? They seem to have been relatively more popular for more than just a day, recently. It's something I look for but not necessarily married to anything at this point.
