Commercialized at 2 clinics (with 3 more expected this year) with regulatory clearance in Canada. 

FDA already acknowledged the device's use has no AE's, they merely didn't see a justification in the metrics from the trials. Which seems crazy given that patients in Canada literally asked to meet the company to thank them personally for this life-changing product.

In October 2018, we received our Canadian marketing authorization allowing us to commercialize the PoNS Treatment in Canada. 

In December 2018, we submitted an application for a CE Mark, which, if approved, would allow us to market the PoNS device in the EU. 

""On January 31, 2019, we formed another wholly owned subsidiary, Helius NeuroRehab, Inc., or HNR, a Delaware corporation, which will operate a clinical research site as well as a rehabilitation clinic that will provide the PoNS Treatment to patients with balance and gait disorder following our receipt of marketing authorization from the FDA."" 

From previous clinical trials completed:
‚ÄúWe successfully met the primary and secondary safety endpoints as measured by a decrease in falls at week two a decrease in headaches at week five, respectively, in both treatment groups. 

There were no serious device related adverse events.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe study demonstrated that the PoNS Treatment could, on average, allow patients with mmTBI who had chronic balance deficit and other injury-related functional disabilities, achieve an SOT composite score in the normal range in 14 weeks and maintain that benefit after a 12-week washout period. We believe that this data supports the durability of the response to the treatment and the potential restoration of the balance system. Furthermore, in a subset of nine participants, sequential magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans were performed that showed increased grey matter volume in the cerebellum and elsewhere, commensurate with improved balance.‚Äù

FDA denied them ""Do Novo"" status, but they're already underway commercializing the PoNS in Canada with a minimum of revenue of $1.6-$2MM this year based solely on the 2 signed clinics 


""U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declined its request for De Novo classification and clearance of its Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator device (PoNS). The agency said it did not have enough data to determine the relative contributions of the device and physical therapy in clinical studies, but said the company could generate additional data and resubmit its application.""

In 2015 the company saw a similar drop from over $10 down to $2.45 and within 3 months had recovered to $5.75 

The recent candles show every white soldier bullish candle is slightly bigger than the prior which is a well known notable bullish tech pattern that leads to increasingly larger white soldier candles everyday until a parabolic one occurs usually a 100% type day. At current levels I don't expect any such day to occur but I do anticipate the daily gains will steadily increase pushing this easily back over $5.00+ in the coming weeks.

SPRING HILL, Fla., April 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- VaporBrands International, Inc. (OTCMKTS: VAPR) one of the pioneers in the Vape movement has joined the NASCAR team of advertisers beginning with ROAR! Magazine, NASCAR's only twice-weekly digital magazine.  


The half page advertisements will be seen in upcoming issues of ROAR marking the first time a CBD Vape pen has been allowed to advertise in an officially licensed NASCAR Publication. The advertisement as it is expected to appear in the up coming editions of ROAR can be seen at [**www.vaporbrandsint.com**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=v90K7a_xvGR0x9swdTOYO0wHu7jFIwomqq3w6YT8y5_SdlipB6epwU8uAZFLZO70ryjKvPDChmwn_Lh5lSEApXm1sKJEOzRhuaqjcCrBqis=)

ROAR! NASCAR's¬†only twice-weekly magazine for the dedicated race fan is published with the mission of getting fans excited about the upcoming week's race and has 74 different editions starting in February and ending with the Champions Edition in late November. ROAR! is a photo and feature driven publication with a behind-the-scenes look at drivers from all NASCAR series. ROAR! has an extended photo section in each issue, offering readers a chance to see drivers with their families, in the garage, on the grid and in their racecars. ROAR! also has race previews, predictions, crew member features, historical content, paint scheme spreads and more.

VaporBrands first CBD product which will be seen by NASCAR fans available now is appropriately named ""Tranquility"". It contains only the highest-grade full spectrum CBD in a smooth Vape cartridge. The product does not contain any nicotine, or other addictive substances or drugs. ""Tranquility"" is intended to give the consumer an alternative to smoking while providing them with the calming effect of the specially formulated CBD blend.

Eleanor Hodge CEO Stated: ""NASCAR Racing has become one of the most popular sports in America and its popularity is increasing every year.¬†VAPR is very excited about having our new CBD Vape product ""Tranquility"" introduced to such a dedicated and enthusiastic fan base. We intend to continue to ramp up our marketing and advertising efforts making people aware of our products and Company as well and look forward to sharing our progress.""

VaporBrands is returning to the forefront of the industry launching its top end CBD Vape cartridges available now nationwide. The new product and marketing plan are due to VAPR signing a product development, branding, and marketing agreement with ReelTime Media (OTCPK: RLTR). In that agreement, RLTR provides the development of marketing and branding, production of commercials, advertisement copy, and placements of all media as the Agency of Record. ReelTime Media,¬†whose capabilities are redefining how companies are evaluating and purchasing their TV, radio, print and other new media, has had strong success recently with marketing Baristas CBD Coffee and is leveraging that success for VaporBrands CBD Vape cartridges.",2019-04-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bdxinl/vapr_vaporbrands_joins_nascar_team_of_advertisers/

SAN DIEGO, April 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire -- Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: GRYN) (‚ÄúGRYN"" or the ‚ÄúCompany""), an innovative, full-scope, science-driven, premium cannabis cultivation and branding enterprise, is pleased to announce it has entered into a Letter of Intent for the acquisition of Coastal Labs.  


Las Vegas, Nevada-based Coastal Labs was founded by Kavan Thanasith and Travis Chrisman with the intention of providing raw CBD products to CBD merchants under the Coastal Pay umbrella. Founded in 2014, Coastal Pay was recognized in 2017 by San Diego Business Journal as one of the Top 100 fastest growing private companies. Coastal Pay, a leading processor in the CBD industry with the ability to provide long desired solutions, has created and continues to create strategic partnerships and opportunities advantageous to Coastal Labs.

Coastal Labs focuses on marketing and building the book of business while leveraging other laboratories through various strategic partnerships to fulfill orders.¬† In doing so, the company‚Äôs network is one of the strongest in the industry with access to the best talent nationwide in order to create the highest quality products.

Coastal Labs has generated various revenue sources by expanding its network throughout different sectors of the industry with a focus on sales of seeds, hemp and lab equipment. The company initially began sales in CBD isolate production when there was an extreme shortage in the marketplace. From there, the company formed partnerships and relationships with the best isolate producers and extractors and has since expanded sales into THC-free distillate production.

With this acquisition of Coastal Labs, Green Hygienics will be adding one of the premier labs in North America to its Brand Portfolio.¬†The company will continue on its stated path of making strategic acquisitions that can be vertically integrated into overall operations and create extraordinary value for shareholders.",2019-04-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bdw5gk/gryn_green_hygienics_holdings_inc_announces/
