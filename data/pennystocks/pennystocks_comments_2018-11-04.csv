I've been looking around for good hemp stocks to buy into, and GHG is one I have been slowly increasing my position on as it sits comfortably around 8-9 cents USD. The abstract analysis you gave sounds good. I'm a big fan of hemp since the various parts of the plant each can be used competitive in existing markets. I'm personally most interested in how well it can work as home insulation to reduce oil consumption and make a safer home with its fire-resistant properties.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, do you have a projection for how much you expect GHG to make next quarter or at full capacity? I haven't evaluated the stock enough to project anything, and that would help me make a better decision on whether to jump in at this point. Thanks!

90,justbeaguy,e9r9rap,/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/e9r9rap/,1,"To be honest no. I have a different way of looking at stocks:

1) invest in people. I look at people with proven track records and credibility and I follow them to new companies. In this case ghg has aligned itself with a company called hempsmart in America who operates in a network marketing capability, and is owned by one of the ""founders"" of cannabis awareness in modern day.

The way I interpret this, is ghg has hedge their bet with a company that relies on independent sales people to win. It's similar to how isagenix and doTERRA operates. If it fails, those organizations are likely to fail as well, but it doesn't appear to be that way. 

2) I don't like investing in the early Rush unless it's a proven technology. As I mentioned Canada rushed out the door legalizing cannabis and recreational marijuana, and anyone with half a brain knows they did this for political reasons. Canada owes a lot of money (huge debt) and it wouldn't surprise me if they're prime minister thought cannabis could bill them all out the way it has made money for Colorado. 

The problem here is America is much better at Big business, and has more money than Canada. As soon as it starts working in Canada, America will take over. They hold all the power with a newly negotiated USMCA contract, and it wouldn't surprise me if they later add stipulations allowing American cannabis Farmers to sell in Canada. 

Since ghg is already aligned with hempsmart publicly, this puts them equity advantage should a situation like that occur. 

Well companies like Dan bilzerian's (ignite) use holding companies awaiting legalization, hemp smart is already started in a legal capacity. 

3) everyone wants to be Budweiser, but ghg appears content with providing materials for everyone competing for that spot. 

I have no interest in relying on stocks that need marketing to work. I want to invest my stocks in companies that are a necessity for those other companies to work.

4) British Columbia has been operating legalized medical cannabis for over 30 years, and these guys are set up there. 

They also have offices in Los Angeles (Democratic), Quebec (conservative/republican), Ontario (split conservative and Democrat), and I'm sure they want to expand. 

They are well aligned on both sides of the political fence and I love companies like. They are not interested in playing politics, they are only interested in working. Because of this, both sides of the political spectrum want to work with them (if not now, than later).

5) they want you to work with them as well. I remember reading on their website they like to have their investors involved with the company. I love this, because I am passionate about the industry, I will continue to spread positive information about it. If they decide to hire me one day, I will work hard to win because I'm heavily invested in it from the start. It's a win-win when you operate as a positive community. 

6) the stock is literally under $0.10 American. Even if you invest $1,000, the likelihood are they going up is great. In today's day and age with the economy booming the way it is, that can only go up. If this stock crashes to nothing, it's safe to say millions of other stocks will crash to nothing and that means everyone loses everything. 

To me that makes this the safest bet in the world, because you can only win or lose along with everyone else. 

Just some information about myself: I am self educated in the Cannabis industry. I took it upon myself to learn as much as I could in my free time. I would also say, communication is one of my strong points do to my upbringing in a very multicultural area. That makes me an ideal sales person, consultant, and brand ambassador for this company if they choose to one day hire me.

In the meantime, I continue to spread information and work for free because every time the stock goes up I will win. And I want everyone else to win with me, because it's more fun that way. 

Right now I own around $5,000 USD in the stock. That is not much on the grand scheme of things, but I work hard. I will continue to invest money in this company for the rest of my life, and I will continue to spread positive information about it to help it win.

If you would like to know anything else let me know. If you want to take a chance to make a lot of money, invest in the stock. If you want to play it safe buy some American money and let it sit in an account until the market crashes, and then go by Tesla stock and Amazon stock for discounted rates.",2018-11-04
91,tsking02,ea28q8x,/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/ea28q8x/,1,"I've been slowly putting more money into this stock as well and I like your principles for investing. I do think number crunching is half the battle but the numbers should eventually give way to good principles.

There is another similar stock called Crop Infrastructure Corp who has similar plans for growing hemp in Western usa. They have a 240 acre plot currently going into the end of the year and similar to ghg they plan to build into a 1000 acre expansion. I think they currently have a capacity to reach 1850 acres where ghg has a partnership on half of 150 expanding into 1k.

Have you heard about crop or considered this stock? Owners seem very vested and are not financing their expansions with stock equity. They have already locked in supply deals where ghg seems to still be looking for buyers for their large inventory. Wondering what your thoughts are.",2018-11-04
92,justbeaguy,ea2f679,/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/ea2f679/,1,"I don't know anything about crop but I will tell you this based on the quick analysis:

Crop is triple the price, and when it comes to a penny stock I'd rather on a million then 300,000, haha.

1) I'm not a hundred percent certain, but it would appear to me that ghg is committed to helping hempsmart, and to finding new and Innovative products. 

2) if that is the case it is very likely that for the first 3 to 10 years they are expected to try and sell off their whole cannabis crop in hopes of covering their costs, research and development, while slowly expanding. 

This would make the most sense for a company like that until they hit the jackpot. 

Overtime as stock goes up and people take notice, they will grow.

by selling off their crops they ensure their business sticks around longer in an oversaturated in competitive market.

Companies like Aurora will have to sell their own products. If something goes wrong, either with their crops or competition takes them out, they will be literally worthless. 

Ghg will sell to ensure their survival while everyone else battles themselves out.

They also hedge their bets. They make medical cannabis, and they also sell prepackaged frozen french fries and different foods. They actually taste better than McCain's, and are cheaper to buy. 

so even if they can't make money in cannabis they can subsidize it with the potatoes.",2018-11-04
94,tsking02,ea3pk0t,/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/ea3pk0t/,1,"Crop is triple the price, but only twice the market cap because they have fewer shares outstanding. Mathematically, Crop has 240 acres yielding harvest where GHG will likely have 45 acres from Scion, Oregon and 60 acres from New Brunswick. Both operations are very comparable where GHG is building a strong local network of farmers and Crop has supply deals for its product underway. 

I favor Crop only because I feel the 240 acre yield and product already sold will drive the SP up in the short-term whereas GHG had less of a yield than expected due to crop issues and drying bottleneck with no buyer determined as of yet.

While I admire your loyalty as I'm sure it means quite a lot in your personal life as well, you should consider being open to the idea of having more than one stock. The reason for this is if you are better off financially, you can be a better supporter to the companies you are backing. For example, and clearly there is no guarantee this would be anything more than a thought or idea, you could invest relatively more money in Crop in the short-term... financials come in... you make a little money on your investment and then switch some/all of it over to GHG. Now the company has more support from you going into 2019.

I agree with you about how great hemp is going to be once it's more mainstream. I know tons of businesses out there desire hemp as a product or are at least open to it, but the supply shortage and prices are what keeps it out of the market. Since hemp is such a versatile product, it only has to find a foothold in one of the many markets open to it to increase its supplies which then aids its accessibility in other sectors as well. In my eyes, it's inevitably going to become a dominant product in the world that rivals even cotton. The fact that it can yield more than cotton and is easier to grow and manage only furthers that ideology.

So if I can invest in several promising hemp-based companies, then this is my ultimate goal. I want to take my insight into the future and make some money on it, and I also want to aid in seeing hemp being used more frequently. I could go at length about how highly I think of it. Even just the idea of building cheaper homes and saving more money on heating homes. It excites me, and if I make some money, I'd love the idea of owning a business and working with it myself!",2018-11-04
95,justbeaguy,ea3sjgu,/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/ea3sjgu/,1,"Main reason I am loyal to GHG is when some things are settled in my private life, I will literally call them up for a job. 

I know I can make more money in the short-term by expanding my portfolio, but to be honest, and this sounds crazy to a lot of people, I do not care about money. 

I have enough tangible skills that making money will never be a question, as it's easy for me to get a job and I enjoy working. 

I personally much prefer to see growth, and a company succeed, then pad my bank account.

For those reasons alone, and my own personal ethics I am loyal to ghg right now.

But as I said, I am always willing to open my mind and change my views. 

I may eventually invest, but I will pull money from somewhere else to do so. right now I'm sitting tight anticipating moves that are out of my control. 

I will spend more time looking into crop, I appreciate your help!
