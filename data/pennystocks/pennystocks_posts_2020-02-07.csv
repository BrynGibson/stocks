3,Brokerage advice,f05cj9,SmilingMadScientist,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f05cj9/brokerage_advice/,1,7,"I am super green and need advice. I invested in a penny stock which just had its restrictions lifted. The stock is going really well, and I've held it for over a year, but I wanted to diversify but then found out after trying to file DWAC that Ameritrade, E-Trade, and Charles Schwab won't permit the transfer of the stock into their brokerage. That was pretty disconcerting and now I'm wondering what I got myself into. So the stocks are pink sheet stocks that I purchased through a stock transfer company after working directly with the company's owner from whom I was able to purchase of the shares. I'm feeling red flags all over, but I don't know what brokerage will accept the transfer so that I can actually sell some of these stocks. Can you guys recommend brokerages that might be able to help me? Or just offer advice? Even though these stocks are way up from when I purchased them, I'm getting worse and worse feelings about this situation.",2020-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f05cj9/brokerage_advice/

We had two stocks that weren't doing totally what we wanted but LPTH def had something I usually really like to see. If you've seen some of my past trades/videos I bet it's not hard for you guys to guess.

Basically I love the classic Gap &amp; Go small-cap stocks especially when there's big support underneath. However, the light vol on LPTH kept me at bay..  Here's the full schnitzel if you're interested to see how it all played out: [https://youtu.be/5i3ctS0TJ4w](https://youtu.be/5i3ctS0TJ4w)

Look for 5-8% gains... SELL PT .95+ SL .83
 
HOLDING:
AGRX - 3.73 - Bouncing EMA13 holding trend

SKYS - 1.72( baby bag) RS pumps hot, 1.60s seems to be the new 1.40s for long holders in the alert

ACHV - .58(May sell next move to .60s) stay tuned

AIMT - 36.4 avg I have yet to avg down but I am comfortable holding, avg down target would be around EMA200 26.77. Will hold until 40.

Also watching RWLK and SLRX these may consolidate for a bit, waiting on bottom support to form but these two could be my next AEMD and VIVE holds for the run.

Swing entry alert: $APEX
This one is gearing up again, not sure when it will pop but it can happen any moment, techs looking ready. Immediate target .95. Preferred entry. 67 - .68 if you catch a dip. But .7-.72 are safe entry This may not be too long a swing but since it is not a momentum swing.

What are your plans? What are your predictions?

OGEN and ONTX are both up around 40%-50% in 5 days!

Rumor has it, from a source I find reliable, OGEN is dropping news at the conference on Tuesday. Are you riding it out?

I'm riding OGEN into P2 results in 4-6 weeks and then re-evaluating.

I sold all of both stocks today on spikes and bought back into OGEN on a dip. *Big mistake?*

I've been waiting on a dip for ONTX but they robbed me! You ALWAYS dip ONTX!!

Still, $1,000 day is a $1,000 day!

I'm now in the $10,000 club from $4,000 in total investment. My goal is $25,000+ by EOY so I can daytrade in 2021. Hopefully, the elections don't derail this historic market run.",2020-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f0gtf5/ogen_ontx_fam_celebration_thread/
