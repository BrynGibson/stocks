I feel it will fall again but it may take a day or two, same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago where I sold in panic vs my instinct and lost $150 when I could have waited and made a profit...

4,How to play pdufa approval? AGRX,f4dwx3,morepower2me,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f4dwx3/how_to_play_pdufa_approval_agrx/,1,9,"First time trying my hand at buying stocks and day trading. After some research I came across the biotech pdufa play where you buy a month before the pdufa date and hopefully profit on the anticipation run-up. But like the strategy suggests I sold on Friday before the news. While I'm pleased with my profit, I'm wondering how people usually play pdufa approvals like AGRX just had? 

Last I checked it was at 4.30 at the end of after hours. Come Tuesday morning, I'm guessing many might sell and take their profits since there was such a large scary dump on Thursday. I'm wondering if I might be able to get a limit order in for 4.00? Or is it better to buy at whatever market price there is in the morning and wait for a price of 5 or 6 which I'm hearing it may reach.",2020-02-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f4dwx3/how_to_play_pdufa_approval_agrx/
5,Dixie Brands (DXBRF) Down but Not Out,f4dsmn,BacKnightPictures,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f4dsmn/dixie_brands_dxbrf_down_but_not_out/,1,6,"Dixie, like all pot stocks in 2019, has been beaten to a pulp but this is a legit US based cannabis company. This isnâ€™t some bogus penny junk like most penny pot stocks. Dixieâ€™s THC products have been in Colorado for years and more recently they have expanded to California, Washington, Oregon and other legal states. The company also has CBD offerings that they are regularly expanding. DXBRF current marketcap is a paltry $22mm with 122mm shares outstanding. With an estimated $20b domestic cannabis market over the next few years Iâ€™m thinking Dixie should be valued much higher. Iâ€™m in for 10,000 shares at .17 and will likely average up or down over the next few months",2020-02-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f4dsmn/dixie_brands_dxbrf_down_but_not_out/
