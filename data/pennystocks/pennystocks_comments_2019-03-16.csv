47,Ghillie__,eipxw9l,/r/pennystocks/comments/b1xtw7/lptx_monday_presentation_time/eipxw9l/,1,"So, I'm actually relatively new as well, only a month or so in, but for context, I'm using Robinhood. What the trailing stop means is that I'm maintaining a stop-loss order that's the current average value of the security minus 8%, and my wording was ambiguous, but what my actual meaning was is that that specific order will dump 75% of my position (automatically) if it were to suddenly slide 8%. Now, knowing the volatility of this particular security, this might seem stupid, but on Friday, it actually saved me from missing out on a pretty decent position expansion after hours using profits already made on that position. The other 25% of my position would be liquidated after at 11% drop. Bear in mind that these are not hard limits; they're the closest I get to arbitrary values, and basically represent precision guesswork about the maximum short-term changes likely to be induced by hour-to-hour volatility, and they need to be adjusted based on how much you've already made off of that position, the average volatility over a given period, and so on.   


There's an argument to be made, without doubt, that my strategy of simply moving my trailing stops forward rather than setting an actual target or limit order for a target opens me up to market volatility suddenly liquidating my position well below peak price, and this is a 100% valid argument, so I'd advise some serious consideration before applying any part of it yourself. One attempt I have made to fix this is setting several trailing stops at various percentages, such that general volatility *could* trip liquidation of some in a sudden but recovering dip, but is unlikely to drop the entire position unless it takes a serious turn for the worse. For me, I do it for risk insulation purposes to ensure that a gain, once above a certain threshold, **is never allowed to become a net loss**. As far as I'm concerned, only making modest gains, even sub-optimal gains, is fine so long as my risk mitigation strategy holds and keeps me from making any losses that can seriously impact my portfolio. I do this in conjunction with a policy that I never invest more than a certain percentage of my portfolio value on one position, which was initially 25%, but has since been moved to 20%. Overall, this is still relatively high, but I'm not trading with much money anyways, so setting a limit below that actually severely limits my options to purchase certain higher-cost positions; as I increase capital, this percentage continues to decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

Strategically, it's just another piece in a much larger overall puzzle that is designed to make sure that my trades are as close as possible to one-way gates. Practically speaking, there's no way to outright ensure that all trades turn out positive, but I figure I can use extensive DD and strategies like this to get as close as possible. A reality I may some day be forced to confront is the failure of this strategy, but until it does fail, or I find a plan-breaking flaw, I'm going to continue to use it.",2019-03-16
