Jacksonville, FL, Oct. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Blue Water Ventures International, Inc. (OTCPK: BWVI) and Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. (OTCPK: EXPL) announced today that several months of archaeological field work, including magnetometer surveys, has been performed on the 1840 wreck of the Steamship *North Carolina*. In late September BWVI recovery vessel, the Blue Water Rose, and dive team arrived on site to commence recovery efforts.  Gold coins, marble, dinnerware, and brass spikes, used in the ship’s construction, were among the first shipwreck items to be found.  Recovery efforts will continue as weather permits during the months of October and November.  


The Steamship *North Carolina* sank the in the early morning of July 25, 1840, after colliding with its sister ship the *Governor* *Dudley*.  All passengers and crew from the *North Carolina* were transferred to the *Governor Dudley* within minutes of the collision without loss of lives.  However, passenger baggage and ship’s cargo were lost in the sinking.   It has been estimated that the hard currency lost on the SS *North Carolina* would be worth many millions of dollars in today’s value. 

It is believed that some gold coins from the newly commissioned US Mint in Dahlonega in 1838 would have been in circulation prior to the sinking of the SS *North Carolina* in 1840, and if found, these coins would be extremely valuable in today’s collectors’ market.  [http://www.dahlonegagold.com/dghist.htm](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g839EhoBuLmVgx_vf79AbkVnSHlJF-E4QCLzmX1cX0vGTzqNglLtPqInBn8knk6YB0dDeeeCG5G1Pg67yRqKN9ZXY0rusZgjWmjILtvkxyXmeusr-oSnnj5DQprCH-9KnbWoFtXIDPvS9vygfoeYYA==)

Keith Webb, President BWVI, commented, “After working the first half of the 2019 dive season on several wreck sites, some famous, some not, with the goal of future admiralty claims, it’s great to be back in recovery mode on the SS *North Carolina*, especially when you see gold coins the very first day on site!”  

The Blue Water magnetometer survey team will now relocate to the SS Pulaski site, to remap the area.  After several trips to the Pulaski site, it has been revealed that the 2018 hurricane season shifted sand and the debris field.  In order to use resources efficiently, the BWVI team feels a thorough, updated survey of the area is required. ",2019-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dcpwp9/bwvi_blue_water_ventures_international_and/
