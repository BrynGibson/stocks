2,Bubbs77,eycs3oh,/r/pennystocks/comments/cwlfcd/invu_getting_into_crypto_but_have_not_announced/eycs3oh/,1,I’m loaded fairly heavy (for me) on this one.  I haven’t pushed it hard on others because I think there may be some time before it really starts to moving in the way I’d like to see it. Best I can tell they are a solid company with several revenue streams as well as some solid concepts that will be rolling out soon. For me at the moment it’s a buy and hold. Once I see momentum I may load more. I do have hope for this one over the next few months. If they continue showing positive revenue and if that revenue grows we should see this thing rock.,2019-08-28

If trading is simple, why don't you write a book on it instead of selling a **$300 chatroom service**? Many people messaged me questioning whether to trust someone who's under the auspices of a guru trading website; one that presents a guru who's going to teach you the tricks for **$300**. I have no opinion either way, although it's sketchy. Trading isn't simple by anyones standards.",2019-08-28

Once again - not me who mentioned the room, it's you. I'm not advertising my room on this post, or the last post. I don't even mention it when people ask me in the comments.

Yes, I told you I use the service to have a form of supplemental income. 

Yes, I've proved my trades to you. 

Yes, you continue to comment on everything I post.

My chatroom has less than 200 members and VERY few of those people directly follow my trades so market manipulation is pretty much out of the question. I give a detailed trade plan on how to execute setups and share my trades but I'm not Ross Cameron with 2,000 people following my trade.",2019-08-28

If the stock price comes back to them eventually they’ll be wanting to get out ASAP, this is considered your “supply” or resistance. 

Same idea with short sellers just flip it.",2019-08-28
