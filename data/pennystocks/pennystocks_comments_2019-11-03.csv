6,jameson62,f6f2qac,/r/pennystocks/comments/dr489c/top_10_penny_stocks_on_robinhood_for_november_2019/f6f2qac/,1,they do this top list at the start of each month. It's interesting to see which stocks are popular and which aren't. I'm not a big Robinhood fan but they are very transparent to show how many users are buying specific stocks.,2019-11-03

I'm not ""not a fan,"" it's very easy to buy and sell on that app but it's very basic in my opinion.

13,LSATtutor_,f6f5g14,/r/pennystocks/comments/dr489c/top_10_penny_stocks_on_robinhood_for_november_2019/f6f5g14/,1,I have loved it. I have made 50 dollars in profit in one week so far (12 have been from refferal). I am very cautious tho so far and only am getting safer stocks but I wanna start using a small fraction of my money for penny stocks. I am not super experienced with any other stock trading platform so I really do not have anything to compare it to,2019-11-03
14,jameson62,f6f6nkt,/r/pennystocks/comments/dr489c/top_10_penny_stocks_on_robinhood_for_november_2019/f6f6nkt/,2,"true. It is very easy to buy and sell on that and there is some basic news. Once you get into things like charting and learning that news can dramatically impact a stock within a fraction of a second, it becomes important to stay ahead of the curve as much as possible. But this isn't to say RH is bad. And depending on your strategy you may not even need access to immediate info. Congrats on the profit too!",2019-11-03
