4,OTC Penny stocks - Restrictive Legend - Rule 144 Opinion Letter - Financial Hardship Exception,8rs1r4,digitalogic8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8rs1r4/otc_penny_stocks_restrictive_legend_rule_144/,1,5,"Regarding securities obtained through a private merger that now have a Restriction Legend requiring Rule 144 Opinion Letter.     
      
- I am a non-affiliate.   
- but the company is unregistered with the SEC.   
- this I believe places me in a required 12 month rather than 6 month holding period.   
- I need a portion of those funds sooner.   
- ticker: CBWTF.   
- location: NYC.     
      
Response from my broker,     
""The key to using a 6 month holding period requires that the company be a â€™34 Exchange Act reporting company (be subject to the 34 Act and filing periodic  reports with the SEC).  It appears that the company is not a â€™34 Exchange Act company (it is not registered with the SEC) and does not file reports with the SEC although it does file reports in compliance with the OTCQB standards and in compliance with some US securities law so as to be traded in the US. I spoke with the company and asked them to clarify its position with respect to this issue. Based on what they said the company is not a 34 Act company you would be subject to a one year hold to sell under Rule 144."".    
      
**Is there any exception to the 144 security law that takes into consideration financial hardship, bills, etc?**     
      
##Summary:.     
##Looking for a Rule 144 Opinion Letter with the potential to shorten 12 month holding period based on financial hardship.      
     
Thank you!    
     
    
Additional information:    
Right now my position is 150k shares with an individual price of around $1 but it's also a Canadian company with the ticker over there being CBW although it is traded on us markets as CBWTF. The position is of decent size but given that it's an OTC penny stock they don't really want to deposit it nevermind collateral loan.     
    
I just can't shake the feeling that when I was first researching the 144 Opinion Letter I read something about hardship.    
    
Perhaps would it be easier if I tried to open a brokerage account somewhere in Canada? Since the shares are sitting at ComputerShare in Canada and I can't even transfer them out unless that Restrictive Legend is changed. So I can't even bring them into the country without the legend removal. Craziness! :)",2018-06-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8rs1r4/otc_penny_stocks_restrictive_legend_rule_144/
