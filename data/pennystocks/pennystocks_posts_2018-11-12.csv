**“12 Online Solutions” Empowers Retailers with Advanced E-commerce Tools to Help Them Effectively Battle for Relevance Against Amazon**  


Las Vegas, NV, Hong Kong &amp; Salt Lake City, UT, Nov. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, 12 ReTech Corporation (OTCQB: RETC) unveiled its revamped Lexi-Luu Dancewear e-commerce site. Shoppers and consumers can view and shop at [www.lexiluudancewear.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TWSE2puEKP0ME0cMEe-aYAUh1xwRA5fL3DtM8V0NbldmBvQqITNSCc55rOfVeY72L8u6PbPNFt283kW2yPU5pYx-k5IziuTalZWjf9H_a-c=).

The new website built upon the Shopify e-commerce platform was created because its predecessor was not able to utilize any of the components of **12 ReTech’s “12 Online Solutions**” which the Company uses to improve the performance of its own as well as client’s e-commerce properties. Built on a Shopify base, the new site features “best of category” practices that many successful online stores utilize, including rich content, fast checkout and multiple checkout solutions as well as Google analytics.

And this is just the beginning. 12 ReTech will begin to add its “12 Online Solutions” features such as “shoppable video”, gamification modules and machine learning algorithms that match content with viewer demographics. The “12 Online Solutions” also provide advanced analytics that allows our team to combine and analyze data from the myriad data sources that are used in e-commerce marketing including: its website, Facebook, Instagram, e-mail campaigns, Google, SMS, Snapchat and others. It also includes tools and techniques which are designed to attract, engage and convert shoppers into buyers.

The new Lexi-Luu online store is being transformed into a comprehensive platform that controls all aspects of business operations from manufacturing and marketing to shipping and receiving. It will directly interact with our 12Mobile APP and will even allow wholesale customers to purchase at different pricing levels than consumers.

Ashley Tomaszewski, VP of Digital Marketing at Emotion Fashion Brands commented, “when properly implemented, 12 ReTech’s “12 Online Solutions” delivers the ability to affect shopper behavior by collecting real time data and utilizing predictive analytics to deliver relevant content to each individual shopper via web and mobile channels. The purpose of these advanced tools is to get shoppers to stay longer on an e-commerce site and raise conversion levels.  


Angelo Ponzetta, Chief Executive Officer of 12 ReTech commented, “Our technology is designed to attract shoppers to our retailers and convert them into buyers. We are constantly adding new innovations to our offerings which are designed around these concepts. We understand that it’s not just about technology, it’s also about content that is innovative and engaging while fully utilizing the power of today's technology.”

Mr. Ponzetta continued, ""Look for 12 ReTech to create technology that make it easier for shoppers to purchase goods from our retailers. Amazon created ""One-Click"" to reduce online shopping cart abandonment. We will soon be discussing our own e-commerce innovations that make it easier for new shoppers to become buyers!""

Hub Blanchette, CEO of Emotion Fashion Brands said, “The 12 ReTech Team continues to be amazing to work with! They have resources that we could never have reached on our own. We have made fantastic progress in all aspects of our business in a short amount of time.”

Mr. Blanchette continued, “To celebrate the launch of our new Online Store, Lexi-Luu is offering a 38% discount site-wide to everyone for two whole days! Our wholesale customers and distributors are encouraged to contact us for special deals for them to stock up for the Holidays!”",2018-11-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9wgjy9/retc_12_retechs_lexiluu_dancewear_launches_new/

&amp;#x200B;

NEW YORK, Nov. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE – HempAmericana, Inc. (OTC: HMPQ) (“HempAmericana” or the “Company”) is excited to announce that it has begun processing 4,100 lbs of in-house Hemp Flower inventory at its primary extraction and processing facility in Augusta, Maine.  


This initial production phase will output a high-quality raw biomass to be stored in cryo-freezers installed at the facility. As previously stated in the Press Release dated October 31, 2018, two final pieces of refining equipment are scheduled to arrive later this month that, when installed and activated, will convert the stored high-quality biomass into a fully refined CBD distillate, ideal for use in manufacturing CBD products such as oil tinctures, capsules, and vapes.

CEO, Salvatore Rosillo stated, “It’s very gratifying to now have the team in place, the equipment fully up and running, and the raw flower finally being pushed through this state-of-the-art facility. I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. The scale and complexity of what we have accomplished here over the past two years cannot be overstated.”

The initial ramping-up process will be managed according to best-practice protocols. During this initial stage, the facility will be run with single-shift manpower and 33% processing capacity (relative to maximum potential capacity for the supercritical CO2 extraction machine). This will provide for a standard “working out the kinks” phase, during which the production team will become fully acquainted with all elements of operation and workflow through a series of production cycles, and management will be able to review and optimize the process.

The Company will then consult with technical experts from the machine manufacturer, who will aid in scaling up production to full capacity.",2018-11-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9whiyk/hmpq_hempamericana_commences_processing_hemp/

10,Why MC Endeavors is Important in the Fight Against the Opioid Crisis,9wh6ue,PennystocksN,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9wh6ue/why_mc_endeavors_is_important_in_the_fight/,1,0," 

DETROIT, MICHIGAN – (**PENNYSTOCKS.NEWS**) – MC Endeavors/Room 21 Media **(OTCBB: $MSMY)**. The Opioid Crisis is at an all time high in America. Last year over 72,000 people have died because of the use of opioids. That’s over 200 people each day that will die form opiod overdose. **This enormous crisis brings big costs to healthcare and loss of productivity and is estimated to be over $78B Dollar a year.** The number is very high because opioids are one of the most dangerous addictions. Even the US government was forced to create the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018. According to Stanford University research, “every American household is now acutely aware of the drug epidemic.”

With over 200 deaths a day from opiod overdose, America needs compelling information via video, social media and the internet. Professionals in the addiction treatment industry and  survivors of the opioid crisis have not had a comprehensive platform for telling their stories to others and preventing others from getting addicted to the various forms of opiates. The advance in technology and complex marketing structure makes it hard for them to have their story  and professional experience heard. Thus, their voices go unheard. But not anymore…

MC Endeavors also known as Room 21 Media is a Technology and Media company that functions as a full-service marketing agency specifically in the addiction treatment and recovery lifestyle industry. The Room 21 Media expertise in analytics, branding, social media, video production, search engine marketing and web development is being used to ensure the critical message is being heard worldwide. They provide a platform for addiction professionals to provide guidance and survivors to tell their story. The goal of Room 21 is to prevent further use of opioids in order to save people’s lives. **Room 21 Media is a major contributor to the fight against the opioid crisis...........**
