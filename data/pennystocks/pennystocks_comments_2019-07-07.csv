Not telling you what YOU should do, but I'd pick a penny, and let it ride. Follow the rumor. Personally, I'd wait for WKHS to drop about .10-.20 and drop it there. AMRH is probably a good ""value gamble"" at the moment as well. Both have the rumor and, if the rumor comes to fruition, are guaranteed to explode, even if only for a moment.

AMRH has been an easy flipper, buying at or around .31 and selling at .35.

I've flipped WKHS many times on the way up. I'm currently out of both, but am awaiting reentry. I'm only risking small percentages of my portfolio. But IF I were to go ""all in"", it would be there. They both have news in the pipeline that COULD drive them to parabolic gains.

HSGX has a reverse merger coming up that could spike it to some good gains, AMRH could run some more, I'd expect that PTN will move over time, etc, etc.

Point is, it's ALL a gamble, but you can control when and where you throw in your chips. That's all that you control.",2019-07-07

I would also like to put out there, I am not an analyst, a financial advisor or someone asking for financial support. Take a look yourself in any of those stocks I listed. Easy money if played right. Make a good entry and good exit. Ignore the BS, hop into any group and you’ll see a majority of people say hold, good news tomorrow and so on and so forth. Trust yourself, because everyone’s target is double, triple or quadruple the best probability. May find average rises of 25-45% and average declines of 20% from averages. Look to get in low, but advise getting out before anticipated daily target. So join StockTwits see what everyone is predicting, if price is at 0.15 and everyone says it’s going to hit 0.23-.25 tomorrow, I would set my sell at 0.22-.225.

Not everyone can even create a savings account, because they’re living paycheck to paycheck. Watch a stock for just a 5 day period you’ll see the bottoms and the highs. Get close to the average bottom and exit around the average high. 

Every trade I make is for 10-40%. If I don’t see consistent ups and downs in those percentages, I keep my money out.  I’ve had 43% average increase monthly year to date and there are thousands of people who do better than that every week involved in the same stocks. Then there’s been lots of people who bought peaks and then stop losses or panicked had them at a loss. Happens all the time. So again watch and follow patterns. 

Look at $SLS for example. Hype say daily we’re hitting .40-.50s, but recent lows were at .10 and and then up to .17, back down to .10 and then into the .20s now, but so many people are anticipating huge jumps, I trust the variances that constantly keep happening.  Currently the stock is at 0.23 and Friday’s range was between 0.2121-0.2588. Good entry  tomorrow would be 0.22 and 0.253 and that being 15% for that day. 

The premarket can always have a good layout of what the day could be too. Which Friday high was 0.26 and low of 0.2015. Then you have your investors who get hyped and say this is breaking 0.30 today, 0.40, 0.50 today! Then you have some saying this is going to hit 0.18 today which creates all kinds of emotions. Now you have people waiting for 0.18 and then when it hits 0.2121  they’re waiting and then all of sudden it’s between 0.23 and 0.25 for the remainder of the day, because both hopeful high and low do not hit. Between 0.23 and 0.253 you’d see a 10% gain multiple times a day. 

Every penny stock in the pennies will have loads of people telling you this is going to hit $1 once we get good news. What I’m telling you is that many people will settle for a 10% gain that day even with better possibilities. 

Another thing to watch for would be, let’s say 0.25 is the high for a few hours, it becomes a wall, because of the people who would take that gain. If it hits .26 expect a drop off back down to the low, but with everyone witnessing the 0.26 that drop to 0.2121 looks appealing considering the thousands of share purchased at 0.26, so it recovers back into the same range and then then some of the people who just experienced a 18.4% loss sell as soon as it hits .25-.26 to recoup their losses off buying off the hype. 

Same goes for most penny stocks with lots of hype surrounding them. If a stock publicly announces bankruptcy or reverse split, I don’t care how well it’s been even the day before hand, I’m not touching it. There’s risk with every purchase, but negative news can cause a penny stock to drop like stone. 


15% drop offs from the averages and 15 % increases happen often. Catch somewhere between those two and  settle for 10%-25% easily.  So if you can’t look at these stocks and see these openings and exits, then I’d recommend investing in something like AMD or APPLE with long term growth. Plenty of stocks with safer returns. 

With all stocks there’s lots of manipulation and misleading information. Be careful and keep your money as safe as possible. I’m simply saying make safe decisions. Most people buy towards the top of a rise expecting that hyped up run. I say expect a dump after after the high.  Pre market and after market can set the tempo.  Trust what you see and double check the latest news before making a buy.  Hype will say news today, everyday. Discouraging people will say, I’m going to buy once it hits its 52 week low like it’s happening.",2019-07-07

Or something to that effect...
