4,VBIV,e31ktw,randomperson0284,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e31ktw/vbiv/,1,23,"I found this last week and apparently their primary vaccine is 

""The only commercially-available trivalent vaccine containing pre-S1, pre-S2, and S antigens of Hepatitis B."" 

A hedge fund manager named joseph edelman 

""Also in Q3, Edelman and his Life Sciences Fund bought 20 million shares of VBIV, increasing their holding of the company by 78%. The fund now holds 45.9 million shares of the company, with a value of $27 million. This is a significant drop in value from the $45 million recorded at the end of last quarter.""

The stock has risen from 65 cents only a few days ago to 89. It has huge momentum and I will admit I have a personal stake in the stock, however I think it presents a huge opportunity and theres a few price targets online of 4.50 to 5 dollars which is a 450% increase.

It's a 5G company and now that US and China is rocky, I bet it will be pushed to rival foreign 5G companies.
