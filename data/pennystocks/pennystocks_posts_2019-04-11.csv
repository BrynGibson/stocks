SPRING HILL, Fla., April 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- VaporBrands International, Inc. (OTCMKTS: VAPR) one of the pioneers in the Vape movement is featured in the latest episode of LoudMouth News. Loudmouth News is the first, longest running and only syndicated terrestrial (over the air) radio program that focuses on the news relating to the marijuana industry in the USA and Canada.  


VAPR PR April 11  


VaporBrands is also featured in a 60 second audio only radio spot, and an audio/visual version of it purposed for digital dissemination that begins running next week. A special link to the full episode of LoudMouth News featuring VaporBrands return, and the advertisement, can be seen at [www.vaporbrandsint.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wHNaLXV8Mmz7rkbU3lZi9wk0usgld9YK1MCYrB9GdckU-ZsbnkSfqdQJVdGxCrwcjPkIUSJC7SmZ6GbA-FBYAWb6ZYh21AqnHyuZ_YvqC6o=)

VaporBrands first CBD product available now is appropriately named ""Tranquility"". It contains only the highest-grade full spectrum CBD in a smooth Vape cartridge. The product does not contain any nicotine, or other addictive substances or drugs. ""Tranquility"" is intended to give the consumer an alternative to smoking while providing them with the calming effect of the specially formulated CBD blend.

Eleanor Hodge CEO Stated: ""Being featured during the iconic LoudMouth News as part of our launch, and to be included in their own marketing as well, is a perfect beginning to a strong media push. We look forward to being introduced to the LoudMouth listeners as well as many other planned marketing efforts.""

VaporBrands is returning to the forefront of the industry launching its top end CBD Vape cartridges available now nationwide. The new product and marketing plan are due to VAPR signing a product development, branding, and marketing agreement with ReelTime Media (OTCPK: RLTR). In that agreement, RLTR provides the development of marketing and branding, production of commercials, advertisement copy, and placements of all media as the Agency of Record. ReelTime Media, whose capabilities are redefining how companies are evaluating and purchasing their TV, radio, print and other new media, has had strong success recently with marketing Baristas CBD Coffee and is leveraging that success for VaporBrands CBD Vape cartridges.

**About VaporBrands International, Inc.:** VaporBrands International, Inc., is a marketing and development partner for manufacturers of electronic cigarettes.

So those prices are accurate which means it’s very possible to do at the least $30 in a week or two. Sounds pumpy but I like the odds here. Float is around 3 mil or so also.
