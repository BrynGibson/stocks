Using E*TRADE very rarely do my bids or asks ever show up on the level 2‚Äôs. I have found that when I mark my trades all or nothing they never show up on the level 2. However normally if I put a regular bid up without all or nothing it tends to only put a percent of my ask on the level 2 and not the full amount. I have read many places that MM use fake bids and asks to manipulate stock price. Not sure the truth to that however. This by no means answers your question but I do understand where your coming from. ,2018-06-20

Guys, don‚Äôt worry about this spam.

iAnthus - operates in six states including the east coast and Florida. They have decent cash flow, branding, super management and have a fairly large growing capacity.

CannaRoyalty - focus on Canada and California. They have opened a great extraction facility, a distribution hub in Cali and have a wide number of brands. Most of their Cali production will be online soon and they just broke ground in BC.

TGIF - this is a Nevada based dispensary. I love their branding but I think they‚Äôre still just in the one state (maybe also Cali).

Sunniva - most of their production facilities are under construction but they will have one of the largest growing capacities once completed with one of the lowest costs per gram.

IIPR: this is a play on the real estate side of the cannabis industry. They sell greenhouses for a great return and they are the only one offering a dividend ( I think)

Other big US players that I haven‚Äôt done my research on: MPX, Medicine Men, Terratech, Liberty Health (have a great connection to Aphria), etc.",2018-06-20
42,tacopwnsyou,e1160tw,/r/pennystocks/comments/8sjuoe/level_2_volume_between_ask_and_bid/e1160tw/,1,"I think its the fact that so much (majority) of trading is performed by algo's now.  I am not an expert in the OTC/pennystock space, so this might apply mainly to Nasdaq/NYSE listed moreso, but reading books like The Quants, Flash Boys and Dark Pools was eye opening about how much of the markets' trading and liquidity is provided by high frequency operations.  And they pay for server space as close to exchanges as possible and for fiber optic hookups so they can shave trade times down to billionths of a second.  There is no competing as a retail imo on thinly traded stocks if algos are engaged.  Again, though, I can't honestly speak to how much algo's and the firms engaging them give a shit about thinly traded stocks.  I assume when money is on the line and with a plethora of programmers and millionaires worldwide, surely someone has invaded the microcap space w algo trading for profit even if it isn't Goldman Sachs.  You have a better chance on large caps of not being slaughtered because the volume is stupid money every day, but then you obviously don't get as high of volatility and the quick returns.  I think algos have almost killed day trading for the retail investor.  Not completely.",2018-06-20
