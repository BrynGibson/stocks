**ParcelPal is an on-demand delivery service that makes sending packages  easy. Our software instantly connects you with all local couriers in  your area**. 

I bought 1000 shares at todays 0.26 for $260. Closing price currently is 0.2665. I don't see this as a day trade stock but rather, i think this compny is going to expand and do great! Love the brand name. 1000 shares now has the potential to boom from 0.26 to maybe over a buck or more, very gradually over the next 2 years. 

Lots of recent news. Distrobution agreements. relatively young company, public since 2017.

But we should not forget that trading is not the occupation where by doing more you will gain more. Let's talk about what we should avoid when trading nano &amp; micro caps aka penny stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch YT video: [https://youtu.be/TrJm-POnU9k](https://youtu.be/TrJm-POnU9k)

&amp;#x200B;

TEXT for readers:

Yesterday $HUNT was halted and the company now is talking with Nasdaq why it's stock price jumped 10 fold without any news. But the whole thing already smelled bad. And I actually warned people the day before that this stock is nice to watch but be aware while you will get trapped ([https://twitter.com/microcaptraders/status/1110554414128005123](https://twitter.com/microcaptraders/status/1110554414128005123)).

&amp;#x200B;

And guess what? Next day halted.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you haven't chased this stock. But let's step back and look at what happened, why this stock is not the one you should be trading even the gains are so tempting for amateur traders to get involved?

&amp;#x200B;

So there no news and the stocks started flying. Nice gains! But the biggest warning comes from not having volume! Daily and the average volume was very weak in comparison to what you should expect from nano cap runner. Just compare $HUNT daily volume bars with this year's legend $BPTH. See the difference? Volume was there big time!

&amp;#x200B;

To rewind a bit we saw the same price action from $PHUN just three months ago. Very similar stock to avoid and do not even bother to trade.

&amp;#x200B;

So to finish here. If you want to day trade penny stocks big runners you must have volatility (big price increase) and VOLUME. Watch for these two doing magic on stock's price and you have more chances you have the winner to trade.

PR Newswire

VANCOUVER, March 28, 2019

VANCOUVER, March 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - Choom Holdings Inc. (Choom™) (CSE: CHOO; OTCQB: CHOOF) (""Choom""), an emerging adult and medical use cannabis company that has secured one of the largest national retail networks in Canada, is pleased to announce that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") with Better Choice Company, Inc. for the exclusive Canadian distribution rights to Better Choice's cannabidiol (""CBD"") Bona Vida brand of products targeted for animal health and wellness once approved for sale in Canada. The terms of the MOU are not material.

📷

According to the American Pet Products Association, U.S. pet owners are estimated to have spent over $70 billion in 2018 on pet supplies, treatments and veterinary care.  As CBD pet products become more readily available and accepted, well positioned suppliers and distributors will be able to exploit the tremendous opportunities for growth in the CBD pet sales.

**Better Choice Products**  
Under its Bona Vida brand, Better Choice offers a suite of CBD pet focused products in the form of oils and soft chews with several formulations designed to aid the state of good health and well-being in pets.  Bona Vida has formulations which specifically target animals Relaxation &amp; Heart Support, Muscle &amp; Joint, as well as, Skin &amp; Body.

""We are excited that Better Choice has chosen us as their exclusive distributor in Canada for their pet focused CBD products,"" states Chris Bogart, President and CEO of Choom. ""We recognize the importance of growing our brand portfolio and having the sole distribution rights for Better Choice products helps us achieve that in an entirely new market on the horizon in pet use products.  From what we know of in the United States, the CBD products for pet use market has proven to be a high margin business. As the normalization of cannabis-based products in Canada grows, consumers will begin to shift towards these new natural alternative treatments for their pets.""

**Say hello to Choom**TM  
Choom™ is an emerging adult use cannabis company whose mission is to establish one of the largest retail networks in Canada and the United States. The Choom brand is inspired by Hawaii's ""Choom Gang""—a group of buddies in Honolulu during the 1970's who loved to smoke weed—or as the locals called it, **""Choom""**. Evoking the spirit of the original Choom Gang, our brand caters to the Canadian adult use market with the ethos of 'cultivating good times'. Choom™ is focused on delivering an elevated customer experience through our curated retail environments, offering a diversity of brands for Canadians across a national retail network.  

**About Better Choice Company, Inc.**  
At the foundation of Better Choice is the belief that good health practices and nutrition contribute to and promote a higher quality of life. Recently, Better Choice entered into definitive agreements to acquire TruPet an online seller of pet foods, flea and tick products pet nutritional products and related pet supplies and Bona Vida, an innovative emerging CBD platform, focused on developing a portfolio of brand and product verticals within the animal and human health and wellness space. For more information, please visit and https://www.betterchoicecompany.com.
