(OTC:[WUHN](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mK9eNcgrzOhDExAJRWCUx4se8dTO0uyknNDwWMSH65z-Jmf48dyRN_-C4XP57_6vDaMOCCgu2jdiyWcC9-7nqLCVPwSirsVeNW6koFAClEhKKGy9vL5F-5P9UR7v19xIGEWE2MsJLcHTRQCOfEHqrUBJrsmc7FvCXSwgk5zhVl38uXsH7yKRNvyRm-cZvB4at_R0BdXjcCsILfBOC_KqeqZj_o64TbxuylMaoGA_J6gJo4sSBuwt97isKsXyRPVg5Qcf6z3GxCUpA4Ou2_Mk7uTs9q3M37KMkIrQFuF-1lVzKbPFjO5tn9OQm3MXL2cPBmncyaAlKBO8RYFp0Ul7Ew==)) to utilize Mobvovivo‚Äôs Augmented Reality (AR) platform in education, mobile product information, and e-commerce to support medical cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) product marketing and sales. The companies will work together to create the *Dr. Anna MD app - A Practical Guide to Cannabis.*

&amp;#x200B;

Wuhan recently announced the appointment of Dr. Anna Morera Leralta, (""Dr. Anna"") as the company's chief medical officer (CMO). Dr. Anna is a researcher, thought leader and medical practitioner in the integrative medicine and medical cannabis fields.

‚ÄúAugmented Reality will help people learn about and easily understand the medical benefits of CBD and related cannabis products directly on their mobile phones,‚Äù says Dr. Anna Morera Leralta, medical doctor, CMO of Wuhan. ‚ÄúAdvancing the community‚Äôs insight of cannabis and cannabinoids, and ultimately providing society with alternative options and best practices is badly needed.‚Äù

The *Dr. Anna MD* app will allow users to operate their iPhone and Android cameras to get further information about cannabis products while driving advertising revenue, sales, and data analytics. Information about safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids in pain, symptom management, and other conditions, will be available for products worldwide. Manufacturers and retailers will utilize *Dr. Anna MD* for training staff, marketing, and as a service offered to their retail and e-commerce customers. Customers and patients will rely on *Dr. Anna MD* to better understand the benefits, safety, and performance of an exploding number of new products.

‚ÄúUltimately, people will get to know Dr. Anna, as she appears in Augmented Reality, as a great and trusted source of information for cannabis and cannabinoids,‚Äù says Trevor Doerksen, CEO of ePlay Digital. ‚ÄúIn situations where packaging and advertising is limited, users will have access to more information from Dr. Anna by simply pointing their iPhone or Android phone at products.‚Äù

In Canada, California, and other jurisdictions, governments require utilitarian, plain Cannabis packaging and place heavy restrictions on Cannabis advertising. Dr. Anna will help cannabis consumers learn more about products and where to buy them in real time through iPhone and Android smartphones. As a trusted source in an emerging marketplace more information will appear through interactive video and AR when customers point their camera to any product label or advertising at retail or on a website.

The global legal cannabis market is expected to reach USD 146.4 billion by end of 20251. Growing adoption of cannabis in several medical applications such as cancer, mental disorders, chronic pain and others is expected to propel revenue growth. Marketing and advertising budgets will be funneled into approved approaches such as education and technologies that can deliver more information about products to consumers easily.
