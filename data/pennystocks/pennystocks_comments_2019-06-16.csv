Only issue I have is that you make it seem too difficult for people who have accounts less than $25,000. The odds are not stacked against them for only using that low amount of money.  If anything it helps them a lot more in obtaining their goal of ""lots o money"".

Hell, a 20%-30% gain a trade is all you need if you want to obtain about $10,000 in a months time. The preparation is tedious and time consuming, however after that's done then it's pretty easy from there.",2019-06-16

Options in my mind are hard as hell and I get skittish when I hold any stock for too long. Crypto is constantly moving and can be easily pumped and dumped, but you can easily ride the wave with the basics of charts. 

I had years of reading crypto charts back in the day and when I switched to stocks, I found out it was so much easier. An easy example thats recent, FTD files for bankruptcy, What's going to happen ? Stocks going to obviously drop, So you buy low... Wait for the ""protections"" to go in effect and then sell for a nice profit.

I ended up putting around $400 into FTD at .151 for 2,649 shares and then waited. Noticed the next day in PM that it was climbing so decided to sell before Court motions went into effect. Sold at .260 for about $689. Ended up putting it all into a order of .141 before the market ended(filled next day), so that's 4,886 shares. Kept an eye on it every morning when the market ""opens"" and when ""protections"" were approved, ended up selling that at .391 for $1,910

Hell, The main reason why I even said 20% - 30% is all you need to get about 10k in a months time is because I've gotten close to that many times and my buddy from the crypto scene was able to easily do that. 

So yes, trading(day trading at least) can be easy.",2019-06-16
