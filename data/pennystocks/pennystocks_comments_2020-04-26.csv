In terms of how this plays out in my head:

1) FDA approval and SEC do not find DECN guilty... then this stock could rocket

2) No FDA approval SEC find DECN guilty... buh bye money

3) FDA approval and SEC find DECN guilty (unlikely both happen)... who knows lol

4) NO FDA approval and SEC do not find DECN guilty... stock would probably tank

this is all speculation. No one knows. Bashers go with their history of being screwed by their previous investments and saying this is a scam and blah blah blah and people stuck in DECN due to the halt are trying to be as optimistic as possible. 

There is just not enough evidence at this time. Hopefully the PR tomorrow gives some sort of insight, but no one will truly know until May 8th comes around.",2020-04-26

9,AspiringPhysician7,foll3s2,/r/pennystocks/comments/g84paj/decn_test_kits/foll3s2/,2,"I am not familiar with that 2013 episode, but that is for sure a very good point! I know with prostate cancer, if the prostate specific antigen (PSA) is elevated it can be due to presence of prostate cancer or a urinary tract infection. Those are 2 VERY DIFFERENT diagnosis (as you obviously know). It is important that this test has good specificity and sensitivity. 

In terms of this test. That is a very good question. If you do look at Study #2, they are able to differentiate different types of viruses which is a VERY GOOD THING. It does NOT SPECIFICALLY mean that they can differentiate between different types of coronaviruses because that WASN'T studied. This is why I am saying more testing needs to be done. It is possible that I don't have access to South Korean studies that may have looked into this. 

To answer your questions outright, I do not know. However, I believe this is exactly what the FDA is testing. They want to make sure the specificity and sensitivity are high and accurate as compared to approved technologies. If I were to take a guess, I think it is possible that it can be done because there are differences in coronaviruses. They have different spike proteins and I'm sure that causes some change in resistance and impedance, but is it enough to differentiate from other coronaviruses? More studies need to be done to evaluate that.",2020-04-26

510k is when there is an existing approved product on the market and you prove your product is substantially equivalent to that product. This is what they keep complaining about when they talk about the FDA not understanding it‚Äôs not a serology, antibody, or molecular test. If they were submitting as a novel device FDA wouldn‚Äôt be asking about equivalence. 

The fact that they don‚Äôt seem to understand this process as a medical device company is very, very concerning. 

Additionally I will say that I am a professional regulatory affairs consultant for the medical device industry. In the last 3 weeks, my company has brought 17 manufacturers who had never made a medical device before all the way through the EUA process. 3 weeks from ‚ÄúI think we can build ventilators‚Äù to approval to sell ventilators. Even without EUA I‚Äôve seen some de novo approvals for IVDs only take a couple weeks if the validation paperwork is in order.

If they say their test is fully complete and validated, but FDA is holding them back they‚Äôre not being truthful. All these excuses about are significant red flags.",2020-04-26

138,AspiringPhysician7,fona7uu,/r/pennystocks/comments/g84paj/decn_test_kits/fona7uu/,1,"Good question. Personally, I believe the diabetes market is flooded with products. This makes it very difficult to stand out as the GO TO testing kit unless your product offers something (preferably many things) that others don't. Things to consider are how invasive is the product, results that it gives, pricing, efficacy, portability, battery life, and more. I HAVE NOT personally dealt with DECN diabetes test kit, so I'm sure other people will have a better response than me in terms of day to day use. 

With that said though, one of MY CONCERNS is that DECN is measuring glucose from the blood (finger prick). This gives a result for that moment in time, which is great and accurate. However, there are competitors out there that are able to continuously monitor glucose level (for 24 hours) via a sensor that has a very tiny needle that will measure the glucose level in the interstitial fluid. This can be more helpful to clinicians and patients in certain cases. The person that is using the DECN kit has to prick themselves multiple times a day to recheck their blood sugar (which isn't a bad thing, but there are more effective ways). Personally, I like to invest in companies that I believe have an edge over others. In the diabetes market, I am not entirely sure where I would place them.

If you are only looking at DECN from a diabetes testing aspect... It might take off in a year, but I'm honestly doubtful b/c yes they may have won some of the IP against J&amp;J, but these were filed back in 2016. 4 years of time has passed by. That's too much time to give competitors an edge to get their product to market. Also, the everchanging landscape of diabetes testing is hard to stand out in, especially when you have big players like Apple and Samsung getting involved. 

If the COVID-19 test kit DOES NOT get FDA approval, I think this stock is done. I personally wouldn't put my money on DECN if they only had the diabetes test kit. I am hopeful that the technology they are using in the diabetes test kit CAN BE used for coronavirus testing, but more testing needs to be done to prove that. The underlying concept makes sense to me, but we will see if the details line up with the concept in the coming weeks. Hopefully, the data that they are reporting to FDA shows that they actually do have some revolutionary technology that can help out A LOT of people at this time.",2020-04-26

Most people with small accounts normally wants to come to a penny stock and get rich fast. You might have a 1 in a million shot at that. Those people saying they turning 500 into 15k In 15 days did that by selling their crap to people trying to learn. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Be patient and learn.

Perhaps OP is a saleman for AYTU put out there to promote the price by siring up rumors of ""the president retweeting."" Nonsense. Promotion.

OPs post is entirely mind reading, and his ""journalism"" perspective is based on bullshit. Total nonsensical speculation, and comes off as a charlatan.

This is blatantly promotion and totally nonsensical. By even alluding to the president retweeting, or the price reaching new highs, is promotion.

I'm not going to write an entire diatribe why OPs post is nonsense and shouldn't be taken seriously.

The unnecessary politics surrounding this will make this a roller coaster ride. You mentioned all the reasons above, and it really looks petty and authoritarian for the NYT activist to try and cancel this company for trivial political bickering. Like the Streisand effect this will just generate more general interest in the company from both sides, and the political battle will spill out into the general public and MSM picking sides. You would think both sides would come together during a pandemic and look for potential solutions to these problems, but scoring political points, and holding the line is more important, especially during an election year. I deleted my old account to move away from politics and instead talk about investing. Funny to find myself here, but it's hard to escape after 20 years of deep dives into understanding both sides ideologies.

For me the main reason to get in is that stock is low, we have some real possible tests already being produced, and a proof of concept outside the box application in Healight. Why not jump to see where things go? I'm mostly invested in 401k/Roth IRA, and doing the stock trading for fun and to learn.

I can see why you, and many others frankly, would think by the time it reaches the blood, then you would be in terrible shape because it can cause stroke, kidney damage, more respiratory issues, etc... 

It is important to remember that most people who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic. With that said, as we all know, many people experience severe symptoms and require significant medical attention. 

Just because it has hit your blood does not necessarily mean you are going to be in terrible shape. When a person contracts COVID-19, the virus will infect some sort of cell (mouth, nasal, throat, bronchiole, alveoli, etc...) The virus will then produce millions of copies of itself and attempt to infect neighboring cells. Some of those virus particles, however, end up infecting red blood cells (they prefer not to because a virus can not replicate in RBC due to no machinery being in there for them to replicate with). When we are talking about hundreds of millions of cells (after several cells being infected), there is a pretty good chance that the virus will be able to be detected via blood. This is why I believe DECN is testing through this approach.",2020-04-26

The price jumped when they were relisted as DKNG, pretty much just pumped up like any other IPO for a company with hype behind it.

My forecast is that DraftKings and FanDuel will own the market with it comes to sportsbooks in America, and I believe with that they will secure a percentage of the gambling market as a whole when they can roll out their online gambling to more states as they allow it. Both DraftKings and FanDuel both already have the built up infrastructure to roll out Day #1 in any state that updates regulations. They will be the first to every new market, and as long as they dont fuck it up with your loyal customers, they will be around for years in the new online/internet space of gambling.

I‚Äôm not a professional in the field, however, i am studying to be in the field. one of the first things i heard in my classes is that the best thing for cleaning is the Sun. The sun emits UV rays, while potentially dangerous at high amounts, if it is in a controlled setting. such as a room filled with Healthcare professionals and scientists monitoring the amount of UV light being absorbed by the body, then it seems very sensible to use it as a disinfectant of the body.

 Now, one must not forget that harmful UV exposure can cause certain cancers. Thus, room for error must be a minimum. The theory of UV to cleanse the lungs is sensible. However, it does matter how the press perceives it. President trump mentioning a disinfectant caused a large damper in the credibility of a Disinfectant. But media is media.

My highschool level of understanding tells me that a virus attaches to a cell and therefore infects the cell. Once attached, it highjacks the cells DNA to force it to produce more viral particles until the cell dies and all the virus particles inside the cell burst out. So if that's the case, how would this light kill the viral particles inside the cell without also killing the cell and all the others around it? If it doesn't damage the cells would it just kill the virus outside of the cells? I'm sure that's useful, but there's still tons of viral particles inside the cells or in other parts of the body that aren't getting irradiated. If the light somehow kills all viral particles inside and outside of the cells without killing them, how do we know this doesn't make the cells more receptive to infection? Is it safe to be irradiating the lungs of already very sick intubated people? Could this treatment be carcinogenic?

The answer to these questions could eventually be answered, and this could become an effective treatment.
