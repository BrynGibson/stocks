PHOENIX, Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uptick Newswire, a leader in international micro-cap coverage and investor communication, hosted Troy Lowman, CEO of SNM Global Holdings, Inc. (OTCPink:SNMN) (“SNM” the “Company”).

SNM Global Holdings is an eclectic acquisition and development company focused on entertainment and media.  With an eye on immediate revenue creation, SNM recently acquired 50% of two Paul Mitchell schools with right of first refusal on an additional 25%.  “We have also developed a partnership with D.C. based Naughty Girls Doughnuts,” said Lowman.  “We plan to take the brand national, building on the company’s franchise capabilities.  From this, we will make a percentage of each store sold, as well as a percentage ownership in each franchise store.” 

The company’s concentration on entertainment and media will be on display throughout Super Bowl weekend, with an assortment of interviews about the company’s upcoming movie ‘Potential’ with guest star Ray Lewis.

“As a company, we are dedicated to all our projects; but realize the importance of highlighting social issues.  Therefore, we are currently working on a documentary addressing the national opioid problem, which spans all demographics,” Lowman continued.  “We are working with David Tieff and Springwood Production for the film and are in process of planning a benefit to bring awareness and raise money to combat this serious issue.”

“It is always a pleasure to host SNM Global Holdings,” said Uptick Newswire’s Everett Jolly.  “The company plans to fund all its upcoming projects in the next 60-90 days and we look forward to hearing from them again soon.”

Las Vegas, NV (FSCwire) - Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK: ADAC) announced today that they have been awarded a new defense contract to manufacture jury links, a crucial component of the landing gear for the F-15 fighter jet.  Adama Technologies Corp., through their wholly owned subsidiary Alpine Industries, will be building the jury link for both sides of the aircraft.  The contract was awarded in two parts, with the first order creating $225,000 in new revenue to the company.   The Company stated that the second portion of the order, which is expected to be approved in early March, is worth an additional $900,000 in revenue. 

“We are extremely excited to get this news and are confident this will be the first of several new contracts for the company,” stated Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies.  “Our current plan is to begin production on this initial order by mid-February.”

The Company stated that they are continuing to bid additional projects and contracts and expect to be awarded additional contracts as the current administration is allocating additional funds for military and defense upgrades.  Mr. Tanner commented, “The current business climate within this industry is looking extremely strong.  There are lots of additional manufacturing opportunities and new contracts open for bid every single day.  We are very optimistic and see a huge opportunity to increase our contracts and significantly grow our annual revenue.”
