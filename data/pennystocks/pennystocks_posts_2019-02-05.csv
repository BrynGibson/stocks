Antibe Therapeutics Announces $5 Million Bought Deal Offeringe

February 4, 2019 4:01 PM EST
Last Updated February 4, 2019 4:01 PM EST

TORONTO — Antibe Therapeutics Inc. (“Antibe” or the “Company”) (TSXV: ATE, OTCQB: ATBPF), a leader in developing safer therapeutics for pain and inflammation, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Bloom Burton Securities Inc., on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters including Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. and Dominick Capital Corporation (collectively, the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Underwriters have agreed to purchase, on a bought deal basis, 20,000,000 units of the Company (the “Units”) at a price of $0.25 per Unit (the “Offering Price”), for aggregate gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (the “Offering”). Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company (a “Common Share”) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each full warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.35 for a period 36 months.
“This strategic financing will allow us to fund additional development activities for ATB-346 that set the stage for Phase 3 development and fulfill key requirements for regulatory progression and approval,” commented Dan Legault, CEO of Antibe. “This should strengthen our position as we advance global partnering discussions later this year in an effort to fully monetize ATB-346 for shareholders.”
The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to fund research and development activities, including but not limited to, ATB-346’s clinical development, regulatory consulting fees, working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.
The Company has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment Option”), at the Underwriters’ sole discretion, to purchase up to 3,000,000 Units at the Offering Price, exercisable in whole or in part up to 30 days following closing of the Offering.
The Units will be offered by way of a short form prospectus to be filed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The Units may be sold in such other jurisdictions as the Company and the Underwriters may agree.
Closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about February 26, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.
A preliminary short form prospectus containing important information relating to the securities described in this document has not yet been filed with the securities regulatory authorities in each of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. Copies of the preliminary short form prospectus may be obtained from Bloom Burton Securities Inc., 65 Front Street East, Suite 300, Toronto, Ontario, M5E 1B5, Email: ecm@bloomburton.com. There will not be any sale or any acceptance of an offer to buy the securities until a receipt for the final short form prospectus has been issued. This news release does not provide full disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities offered. Investors should read the preliminary short form prospectus, final short form prospectus and any amendment, for disclosure of those facts, especially risk factors relating to the securities offered, before making an investment decision.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Units in any jurisdiction, nor will there be any offer or sale of the Units in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The Units have not and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or any U.S. state securities laws and, therefore, may not be offered or sold to, or for the benefit or account of, persons within the United States or “U.S. persons” (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
About ATB-346
ATB-346 is a hydrogen sulfide-releasing derivative of naproxen. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”) are the most commonly used therapy for osteoarthritis, but their use is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. NSAIDs are also widely used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and general pain reduction, with a similarly high rate of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. It is well-accepted that patients with these conditions would benefit greatly from an effective, non-addictive, GI-sparing anti-inflammatory/analgesic agent such as ATB-346.
About Antibe Therapeutics Inc.
Antibe develops safer medicines for pain and inflammation. Antibe’s technology involves linking a hydrogen sulfide-releasing molecule to an existing drug to produce a patented, improved medicine. Antibe’s lead drug ATB-346 targets the global need for a safer, non-addictive drug for chronic pain and inflammation. ATB-352, the second drug in Antibe’s pipeline, targets the urgent global need for a non-addictive analgesic for treating severe acute pain, while ATB-340 is a GI-safe derivative of aspirin. www.antibethera.com.

📷Inhaled Nitric Gas treatment for clinical use.  


The small unit fits easily into medical offices, emergency departments and nursing homes, and offers a touchscreen for ease-of-use and precision single-dose control. The clinical unit utilizes either a proprietary formula of nitric oxide generation or prefilled nitric oxide canisters.

“The clinical unit multiplies the number of markets Nu-Med Plus is able to serve with our technology,” Nu-Med Plus CEO Jeff Robins stated, “The market-leading innovation offers providers and patients new treatment options, in new convenient environments, to address health issues that significantly impact quality of life and cost billions of dollars annually to treat.”

The unit is engineered to provide treatment for multiple therapeutic needs such as high blood pressure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and other conditions benefiting from vasodilation and increased delivery of oxygen to diseased and injured tissue.

When delivered in precise doses, inhaled nitric oxide has already been proven to stabilize blood pressure, open airways, fight infections and blood clots, treat erectile dysfunction and combat signs of aging.

Nu-Med Plus is currently in the process of FDA approval for three nitric oxide delivery units including a fixed hospital unit, clinical unit, and a portable unit. Nu-Med Plus’s technology is designed to be utilized for a variety of inhaled nitric oxide treatments.
