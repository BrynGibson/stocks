Like, say you have 50 shares, either sell off all 50 and then listen to the news and buy back in and ride the wave if they announce a buy out. Or sell like 30-40 or whatever will get back your initial investment plus a nice profit and then leave the rest in to sit through the announcement. Your best bet to get all the profits you can is the first one unless news is good but you'll still make good profits in that case. The second one will lose you profits if its bad news but it won't sting that much since its extra profit and if the news is good those stocks were bought with a lower price point so its a higher profit margin and more than likely equivalent to what you'd be able to buy if the news announcement is good anyway. 

Either way *secure profits by selling well before the announcement at a good high and don't get greedy*. These things turn quick once news is bad, even if the news is bad in aftermarket. That stock will tank and you will lose all profits and more than likely a good chunk of your initial investment.",2020-05-03

*What is a block halving event?*
“As part of Bitcoin's coin issuance, miners are rewarded a certain amount of bitcoins whenever a block is produced (approximately every 10 minutes). When Bitcoin first started, 50 Bitcoins per block were given as a reward to miners. After every 210,000 blocks are mined (approximately every 4 years), the block reward halves and will keep on halving until the block reward per block becomes 0 (approximately by year 2140). As of now, the block reward is 12.5 coins per block and will decrease to 6.25 coins per block post halving.”

*Past halving price performance*
It is always a debate on what Bitcoin will do in terms of pricing for a halving event. Some people believe that the halving is already priced in by the market and thus there's no expectation for the price to do anything. Others believe that due to price equilibrium, a halving of supply should cause an increase in price if demand for Bitcoins is equal or greater than what it was before the halving event.",2020-05-03

Dollar value per share VS. Total market capitalization is the key differential in your inquiry.

Typically fund managers (think Fidelity or Prudential) are limited when buying stocks with share prices of $5 or less. This is by choice. There is no rule, other than less than $5 may mean problem.

Ford is under $5. The company is worth $20 billion. Penny stock? No. Too valuable.

There is no set rule or official cut-off to determine penny status.

Examples of Ford like small stock prices, yet large market capitalization...

To add to your comment, I like to look at a few things. Starting with the balance sheet.
1. Gearing. How large is their debt compared to their equity.
2. Working capital. (Current assets less current liabilities). In simple terms this is the capital they have to play with for the year.
3. Cash/liquidity. Very simple, what does their cash balance look like.
4. Is their any large questionable assets propping up their BS? Companies will always tend to have goodwill, however if I see a company where goodwill takes up half of their assets I get sceptical.
5. Back to the gearing, debt is important. How much debt do they have, does it look reasonable and their ability to pay it off.
6. Commitments/contingencies/litigation. Do they have any large reserves for a possible or probable liability, if so, read the footnote.

Profit and loss.
1. Key here is growth. Growth or revenue year on year and growth of EBITDA year on year. Something that is very important too is the gross profit margin. As a company grows you'd like to think that they gain economies of scale. You want to see the gross profit margin stay consistent or increase. I don't like to see cost of sales increasing at a larger rate than revenue.
2. Any strange or large items skewing the overall profit?

Of course reading through the 10k is always the second step to DD. It normally starts with reading an article or forum of someone else Impressed with a company before id take my own look. Companies with solid business plans or innovative products/services with large growth potential. Sometimes it's pure luck finding something. 

Never be afraid to invest in a loss making company, provided the loss is decreasing year on year and the growth potential looks good. Most companies start off this way. I mean look at Tesla, still haven't made a profit and stock price through the roof. People obviously believe in the company, the product and the potential.

Anyway, there's a couple of my 2 cents. I've definitely missed a few things but they're some of the important 10k items that I like to look for.",2020-05-03

If you want to set a monthly target (opposed to just buying companies you believe in without having specific targets), you need to calculate the risk aspect as well. 

Similarly, if you play the roulette, you can easily double your money, but you’ve forgotten to calculate the downside, if you think it’s a good Investment.

I'm not sure how craft beer is going to do relative to how well it did over the past decade. The 2010s were a huge boom for craft anything but it's likely that economic setbacks will hurt this industry a lot.

Most established breweries have their equipment already, which means upgrades or upscaling are now in question, as the projected growth and momentum it was meant to serve is now also in question. Keep in mind that pubs, on-site brewpubs, catered events (weddings etc), recreational events such as beer festivals, restaurants serving local brews, etc - they are *now all in question.* 

As the collateral (which is often personal) and numbers provided in the business plans of breweries is now in question, financing will be difficult for startups. They will likely cancel orders, and if they have made any upfront deposits, that will be what BBRW receives.

Not, of course I'll admit, that I know how BBRW does business. Maybe they ask for everything upfront and they'll see their money. But at a time like this, playing hardball with your clients is not exactly a good long term strategy.",2020-05-03

With the profits I will then buy more SECI that is set up for the new trial date this November 9th 2020 to decide how many Billions are owed to SECI.  Shareholders believe that if SECI wins just 1 Billion in damages that 1 share of SECI will be worth approximately $3,275 because only 306,000 shares exist due to 3 reverse stock splits.  SECI created Patented Disruptor Technology that was intended to provide all First Responders including Fire Departments with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications. The technology was strategically stolen by Dutro Engineering and delivered initially to about 8 other companies.  Now the CEO Pericles DeAvilla believes up 200 companies are illegally using Sector 10’s technology illegally.  Ironically there have been clues dropped that Microsoft might possibly be one of them since they purchased a Large Scale Data Analytics Tool from RedRover in 2008. RedRover is one of the companies Sector 10 is suing. All of the Due Diligence information can be found at InvestorsHub.com at the SECI message board.  Shares of SECI can be bought easily through TDAmeritrade or any other large broker.  Robinhood will not work for it.

I'm hoping to buy in as close to $0.50 as possible around 0700 tomorrow with TDA, and plan to set up a trailing stop to submit once the shares hit $1.00 with a stop of $-0.25/0.50 (still debating), with a condition to cancel if the mark happens to fall below my purchase price, in which case I'll just hold until I can at least break even in the future.

I'm looking at a relatively small amount of shares, so I'm not going to worry with selling in phases to cover profit and then let the rest ride on this one, though I do want to look into that as I gain experience and funds.
