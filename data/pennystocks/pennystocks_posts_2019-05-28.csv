14,Bitcoin Equity Research News: Ludlow Research Upgrades Integrated Ventures (OTCQB: $INTV) As Bitcoin Approaches $9000,bu3gwq,louied91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bu3gwq/bitcoin_equity_research_news_ludlow_research/,1,0,"[https://www.investorideas.com/news/2019/cryptocurrency/05281OTCQBINTV.asp](https://www.investorideas.com/news/2019/cryptocurrency/05281OTCQBINTV.asp)

NEW YORK - May 28, 2019 (Investorideas.com Newswire) LudlowResearch.com reports : Integrated Ventures Inc ([OTCQB: INTV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTV?p=INTV&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) was issued an upgrade on its crypto mining operations by Ludlow Research as Bitcoin makes surge towards $9000 over holiday weekend.

**Lower Mining Costs for INTV**

The number one issue when it comes to crypto mining is energy costs. This is a key issue that can make one miner profitable at $7000, while others need $9000 to turn profit based on the overall operational energy costs.

On May 7, 2019, INTV signed a 3 year agreement with PetaWatt Properties, LLC to lower its power costs by over 50%, thus greatly enhancing mining profitability and long-term viability. This alone makes INTV a key player to watch in the small cap crypto mining sector.

In addition, Integrated Ventures intends to market PWâ€™s services to diversify its business by offering hosting and pool services via a la carte packages to third-party miners and market participants.

**Research Upgrade**

On average, $8400 on BTC was a key trigger where most miners begin making profit from mining operations. BTC had found resistance trying to break above that price from its recent run up, but the surge of BTC to near $9000 may start lighting up the crypto sector, and especially the miner.

For that reason, Ludlow Research has issued an upgrade to INTV as near-term play within the Bitcoin crypto sector. Based on BTC performance going into Tuesdayâ€™s open INTV may be expected to open strongly as traders take on new positions.

Ludlow will be releasing a more detailed research opinion on INTV, and investors can request this upcoming report by registering at [https://ludlowresearch.com/investors](https://ludlowresearch.com/investors)
