In penny’s, take your gains where you can. Do not hold shit thinking it will pay off in a year or two.

What is encouraging now, is that the study has been completed in its entirety and now we simply wait for findings.  That alone means that no side effects were adverse enough to bring the study to an immediate stop.  The main question now is if the drug can produce the desired effect of pain reduction and reduced inflammation more effectively/safely than Naproxen, with reduced GI damage + without affecting blood pressure, which are central issues with NSAIDs. I believe in the science and promising previous findings which lead to this trial. (Ranging from one dose of Naproxen causing the same level of gastric damage in rats as a 90 times larger dose of ATB346 ... Right up to previous studies being terminated only because of people lying about pre-existing medical conditions, NOT due to adverse side effects of the drug itself.) I believe in Dr. John Wallce, a shockingly accomplished world-leading researcher/biomedical scientist. One look at his resume will tell the story.  I'd encourage you to look at their website and read their investor presentation, and I'd also encourage you to search through u/PerfectRectangle 's comment history.  He works in the medical space, is intimately involved in the industry and has accumulated hundreds of thousands of shares. In his comments you'll find solid intel, bias-free trails of independent information to begin exploring, including links to videos of Dr Wallace presenting at a scientific conference - which was what helped sell me on Antibe, I bought shortly after.  I haven't even scratched the surface.  Hopefully PerfectRectangle can add key gems that I have surely omitted.  There are many.  Research will convince you this has huge potential.

&gt; And since you asked, here’s a list of tickers that moved up one day and either kept going the next or consolidated.

That's *exactly* what I wasn't asking for. I'm sorry that you're having trouble understanding my quite simple point. Finding a list of data points that confirms a hypothesis without looking for data points that disconfirm said hypothesis is awful methodology.

To break it down even more simply so that there's a chance you might understand, why don't you try and assemble a list of tickers that moved up and then *weren't* able to sustain the move. Until you try to do that,  your list of data points has no meaning whatsoever.

Why aren't you also listing the ones that, after a major spike, don't do up further, and so that you wouldn't make money on, or that you would even lose money on? Do you really think that such stocks don't exist? Do you think you have the ability ahead of time to know the difference?  (Hint: you don't.) If so, how?

This is one to load and wait on news. We’ve seen some good consolidation between 18-21 the last few days so a new base is forming in this range. 

Small history of the stock - it ran to .27 then ASCM ran it down as it does most stocks. All the way to .10 giving us all another load up opportunity all the way up to .23 recently where we’ve seen a little pull back and now building a big base in the 18-21 range. We had LOT of volume in the 22s also so I’m sure they are waiting for more news to load more also. 

Share structure is fantastic 

They purchased a positive revenue streaming business in January 2018 so it won’t show up on their 10k to close out 2017

So this was a company making small moves here and there before 2018 (they changed CEOs late last year or early last year?) Purchases a positive revenue streaming company (Fleaux Services) and THEN Within 2-3 weeks from that announcement - they release a 8K announcing that they extinguished ALL convertible debt! So they are firing on all cylinders. Current play is just simply waiting for 1 of 2 things:
1) news of another acquisition which would send this parabolic
2) 10Q highlighting a profitable 1st quarter from their new asset Fleaux 

*About their Purchase of Fleaux*
Purchased for 1$ and then MILLIONS of shares of GLFH. So essentially —&gt; Fleaux and GLFH’s fate are tied together. Talk about motivation for Fleaux to make this deal worth it by turning profits. Fleaux posted a presentation about the company and within it posts WIP spreadsheets showing upwards of 6+ Mil in contracts lined up for 2018!!!!! 

Jame Ketner, CEO of GLFH, Posted on a 8k in February that they are expecting a 0.04 EPS and 8 mil in revenue at the end of the year. Put simply that this values the company of upwards of 0.80 by the end of the year assuming they hit their projected mark. 

James Ketner and BOD of Fleaux own millions of shares of GLFH but they are not common stock (not all of them at least). Majority are Series A and Series B stock

Series A I believe is locked up until PPS of GLFH hits 0.45

Series B I believe is locked up u til PPS of GLFH hits 3.50 

Maybe have A and B backwards? But they need to avg those prices for 30 days before they can even sell them! So these guys have a lot of faith in the company. 

Sorry this is a DD bomb but I’m just laying 90% of it out here. Please do your own DD! Read their 10k and 8Ks from the last 4 months!!!! You’ll like what you see I bet. It’s not your average stinky pinky. It’s something I’ve used as a vehicle to ride instead of the the big board stocks since it’s actually making significant gains. Chart speaks for itself. There’s been 1 instance of over exuberance (resulting in ASCM walk down) but other than that it’s been a lot of bulls riding long. Not a lot of eyes on the stock yet. Pretty much has gained attention organically and not pumped. But yeah read up on your own and get in if you feel it bud! It’s at least a 4-5 bagger by year’s end as a stable hold if they hit their marks. Nothing close to a pump and dump repeat. Check the charts bud and GL! 

10Q has to come out by May 15th. That’s when the reallllll rise up will continue again big time IMO
