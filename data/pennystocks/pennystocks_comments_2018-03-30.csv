17,FanielDanara,dwik0d6,/r/pennystocks/comments/8875zb/thoughts_on_admp/dwik0d6/,1,"It seems like they are working hard to get new products approved by the FDA this year. I found [an article](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/15/1438438/0/en/Adamis-Pharmaceuticals-Discusses-2017-Highlights-and-Business-Update.html) outlining their 2017 highlights, and their 2018 goals. 

Looking at their charts, I found that they submitted a product to the FDA in January, and its approval in February caused a $2.00 (85.5%) increase over the course of about two weeks. 

Given their drive to keep pushing new products to the FDA, it seems like it would be a solid buy. That being said, I'm not sure that it would be fit for a long term hold, but swing trading would seem alright. Since it peaked in the third week of February, it has since dropped about $0.86 (19.7%). The stock has also been in a slow decline since about November of 2017, which also leads me to believe that it is probably better suited for a swing trading portfolio than a long term gain portfolio. Selling after an FDA approval, and purchasing after things have settled down seems like it would be a solid move.

But, I paid ~$300 for his How To Make Millions course and watched it 3 times. First time was a watch through to get a feeling for what it is I'm learning, 2nd time with notes, 3rd time after a few months to take more notes and compare to what I had learned in the market.

Second thing I did was download thinkorswim and started getting up every morning to do my pre-market scans. This was simply a habit I wanted to build because almost everything that was popping on the after/pre scans were basically over with by time I got to it (i.e. pharma co announces some trial succeeded, there was about an hour or two pop to pump the price, but then volume was dead and then it would take a shit at bell). The important thing for me was to recognize the catalyst-&gt;volume-&gt;pattern and see that there *is* an exploitable method to this all. I can honestly say I started my account with $500 and I closed my account(s) (I opened another) at $3500 in 4 months. Not a bad profit, took some and bought some stuff for the apartment, dumped the rest in crypto for the long hold. The stress got to me, even though I was winning.

So, be careful about gurus. You can learn from them, but don't treat them as gospel and certainly don't call them fucking ""master"" or some shit. Jesus christ that shit is scary (I was in Tim's chatroom for a short time.. holy moley talk about a cult. And bots.) . DYOR, realize it's not going to happen overnight, you're going to make mistakes, don't spend the rent FOMOing some dumb penny stock. Cut your losses quickly. If you're not having fun, do something else. Good luck.
