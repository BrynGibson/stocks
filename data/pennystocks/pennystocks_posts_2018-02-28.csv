14,Antibe Therapeutics,80wu5y,Madmanmadox02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/80wu5y/antibe_therapeutics/,2,3,"How to value:
If we make the assumption that this passes 2b ... what is the value ballpark range would a Big Pharma in just the USA region would go for? 

Their slide deck has 1.5B USA sales annually for Celebrex which is likely its closest benchmark  (My understanding is sales went higher after, reuters had a source with 3B+ worldwide in 2014, and down to 750M after the patent).
The investor deck does say Global IP protection till ~2030.

If N=10 (assume only 10 years to work with patent), r= 18% (standard for bio). Lets be conservative at annual sales 1B (same as Celebrex did first year) and no growth... then lets assume 50% margin (Super conservative)

US Partner Perspective:
NPV = 2.247B; Assume the big pharma partner splits the NPV 85/15 (15% for ATE) to leave both partners with positive NPV.
_________________________________________________________________
ATE's value of deal = Upfront 337M + NPV of Royalties (assume at 5% of sales which is incorporated in the US partners margin of 50%; low for industry when drug under patent). 
ATE'S total value of deal for US Market = 337M +225M  =562M and ATE'S US partner still walks away with  1.91B and any TV after patent ends and sales begin to decline.

Given market value is below 50M it seems this company has a lot of room to run and this doesn't even consider the Western Europe market...

I‚Äôm fairly new to letting myself dabble in pennystocks. If I had sold today at .31 I‚Äôd have had 100% return in under a week. 

Being pretty new I‚Äôm really just trying to analyze how these positions fluctuate. The gambler in me is screaming to try my hand in more of these though. A couple questions for you vets:

1) Is BPMX an anomaly in typical penny stock behavior? If not, how frequently do stocks with aggressive gains like BPMX appear? 

2) How do you guys conduct your DD? Are there specific sites that are better than others at info &amp; predictions? 

3) Have you ever been screwed by not being able to sell due to volume? If so, how best do you recommend avoiding a repeat of that situation?

4) How often does holding long-term work out for penny stock investors? It seems like a lot of people are just playing the gains and losses.
