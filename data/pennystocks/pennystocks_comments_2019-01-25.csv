Understanding Charts: [https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart\_school:chart\_analysis](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis)

Penny stock are about liquidity. The higher the dollar volume the easier it is to get in and out when you want. Low volume stocks will bleed your account dry over time. 

Build a strategy including risk management before jumping in. Don't think you're going to buy 1 stock and get rich overnight. It takes time to learn this stuff. 99.9% of these companies are not buy and hold. Trade the price action and move on.
