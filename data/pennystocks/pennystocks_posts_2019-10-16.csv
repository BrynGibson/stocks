1,Happy Hump Day,diszsg,BlazinKal,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/diszsg/happy_hump_day/,5,3,"Happy Wednesday everyone! This has hands down been the best week of trading in over 6 months. Every day this week we have seen a supernova and multiple spikes! Friendly reminder to do as much dd as possible and put in the work! If you have not traded yet, make tomorrow your day. Nearly anything that is a low float with volume is spiking hard.

I personally banked on $DTSS, $BIMI, $SES, and $BNGO this week.

Some stocks to keep an eye out for aside from the ones mentioned above:

**$VIVE -** This stock gappped up $8 this morning in Pre Market when it was at its highs. This stock does not have any news, but it is a low float play (1 million) and in this market a low float is all you need it seems at this time. This is the 4th supernova in the past 4 days and the trend of low float madness is continuing. If you are going to play this stock have a game plan. Look to get in near support and run with the momentum. Scale out as the stock climbs so you are consistently locking in gains. 

And of course, always remember to not get greedy and take your gains! Green is green!",2019-10-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/diszsg/happy_hump_day/

5,Quebec government in discussion with Tesla for battery project - Graphite company - NMGRF,dirqec,ProfessionalCatWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dirqec/quebec_government_in_discussion_with_tesla_for/,9,7," #NMGRF

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/duplicates/dijzoj/quebec_government_in_discussion_with_tesla_for/

This thread ^ discusses the article (written in French) about Quebec government in talks with Tesla about opening a battery factory. Quebec is wanting to invest a billion dollars into helping to make this happen.

A reddit commented that the article also mentions a mining company he is invested in which mines for graphite which goes into the anode of the batteries that would be made.

The company is trading around 16 cents. 

I'm not really a pennystock investor in general but I figured this would be an interesting one to watch if/as this story unfolds more. What do you guys think?",2019-10-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dirqec/quebec_government_in_discussion_with_tesla_for/
6,Do some DD on PMCB,dirq7y,ricky_bobby86,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dirq7y/do_some_dd_on_pmcb/,1,2,"These guys have been breaking my heart for awhile but brought in some fresh faces. Since then PR has been steadily released to keep updated. 

Sept 20 CC was held and a plan was outlined. To have 2 manufactured runs completed before filing the IND with the FDA. As well as submitting the encapsulation technology to a lab(s) for testing. 

2 days ago PR was released that said first manufacture run was successful. 

Today’s PR was released and said the first manufacture run was on its way to the lab(a) for clinical testing so that way data could be obtained for IND submission. 

They have failed before but what makes this time different is they are worried about having a second manufactured run to show the FDA, which does not require multiple runs, the process is acceptable. 

They are being more diligent about keeping SH informed. 

I work in the medical field and have taken care of many sick patients with cancer, including pancreatic cancer, and it’s painful and there’s no cure. If this is FDA approved it will be a game changer obviously. 

However, even if it’s not successful at curing the cancer, and the encapsulation technology proves applicable it’s still a game changer. 

Our bodies natural defense system kills off any foreign bodies. So cancer and disease processes mutate normal cells and the body believes they are “healthy” cells, so they aren’t attacked. When we deliver medications to fight the cancer or diseases they rarely ever make it. That’s why we use chemo, to flat out just destroy the cells before they replicate and spread. Encapsulation tricks the body by allowing a medication to be delivered like a Trojan horse but on a cellular level.
