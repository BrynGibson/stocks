0,The best pattern for day trading.,a11eky,evil326,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a11eky/the_best_pattern_for_day_trading/,1,9,"Hey guys, low caps seem to not have as much runners lately this year and a TON of fake outs. I know some of my friends use to love gap and go and pre-market high breaks as a signal on the long side but that doesn't seem to be working as well anymore. I went over my tradervue stats and saw this is the most consistent pattern I've been trading. Simple yet effective 73% on my past 126 trades if criteria is correct.

COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE – Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in technology, manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, announces it has won the approval of Binny’s Beverage Depot for the placement of Major Hemp H-IPA in all 40 store locations.   


Founded by Harold Binstein in 1948, Binny’s Beverage Depot is the largest independently owned liquor store in Illinois, attaining over $300 million in annual sales across 40 locations.  Binny’s Beverage Depot continues to open new stores throughout Illinois and has plans for broader expansion throughout the Midwest.

Sipp Industries and distributor Wein-Bauer met earlier this month to discuss expansion plans for Major Hemp H-IPA.  Binny’s Beverage Depot was an early target for retail distribution due to its stellar reputation and widespread exposure to the Chicago metropolitan area.  Following a rigorous process to obtain approval, Major Hemp H-IPA was selected.

Over the past few weeks, the Company has been conducting onsite visits and samplings at Binny’s Beverage Depot.  The feedback on the taste of Major Hemp H-IPA has been overwhelmingly positive and the Company is continuing its efforts to saturate all 40 Binny’s Beverage Depot locations throughout the state of Illinois.  Major Hemp H-IPA is currently being sold at their Downers Grove, Elmwood Park, River Grove, Oak Brook, Orland Park, and Glen Ellyn locations, as well as two locations in Chicago.  With full approval from Binny’s Beverage Depot’s corporate beer buying team, the Company expects to steadily increase the number of locations carrying Major Hemp H-IPA.

President Ted Jorgensen of Sipp Industries’ wholly-owned subsidiary, Major Hemp, commented, “We are thrilled to win the approval of Binny’s Beverage Depot.  Once we learned about the possibility of working with Binny’s and became acquainted with the vast potential of this relationship, we immediately set our sights on capitalizing on this enormous opportunity to showcase Major Hemp H-IPA to beer enthusiasts throughout Chicagoland.  This is a major step in our strategic grow plans.  In addition, the local beer buyers we have been speaking with have indicated Major Hemp H-IPA is the best tasting hemp beer on the market today, which we are ecstatic about hearing.”

The Company also reports that in addition to Binny’s Beverage Depot, its distributor Wein-Bauer has added multiple new accounts consisting of liquor stores, restaurants, and pubs, and is currently in discussions with a major convenience store chain and well-known upscale grocery store to carry Major Hemp H-IPA. 

Chief Executive Officer of Sipp Industries, Syman Vong, concluded, “Achieving the approval of a well-renowned and selective liquor and beer chain like Binny’s Beverage Depot really validates our product.  This accomplishment has now set the stage for further expansion with additional major retail and grocery chains in the greater Chicago market.”",2018-11-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a18mbb/sipc_sipp_industries_announces_illinois_largest/
