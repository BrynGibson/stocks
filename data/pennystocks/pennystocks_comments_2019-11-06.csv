these are gold ETFs that are highly affected by hurricanes, move with oil ETFs and do the exact opposite of the US dollar. because of this, it is easy to see how it will react to certain real-world events that you can watch out for. Ex: hurricanes and oil usage during the winter

my favorite plays are when jnug goes from $30 to $90 during hurricane season pretty consistently. il take my winnings at the top then put them in the reverse ETF on the way back down. basically creating a compounding win every summer. then again during colder winters, the same thing happens on a smaller scale.",2019-11-06

32,RamzFanz,f6snddq,/r/pennystocks/comments/dsjp2h/ogen_granted_eu_patent/f6snddq/,1,"Turns out it's an upgraded patent. The same upgrade is awaiting approval in the US.

There are several catalysts coming up for this stock. US patent upgrade, Phase 2 trial filling up (they're at 180+ of 200ish), Phase 2 results (late this year/early next).

This is a longer play or a wait and see. If you don't get in here, keep it on your radar. Their new drug is a first of its kind, very important to cancer patients that suffer terribly with mouth sores during chemo, and fast-tracked by the FDA. They might be approved without a phase 3 which will absolutely rocket this stock, IMHO.

The risks are that this is their first drug, they will have to RS next spring (or extend), and, by late 2020 or earlier, they will need more money to market the drug.
