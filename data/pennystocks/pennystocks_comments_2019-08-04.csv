Only took a few minutes to figure out why it dropped.

S-1 was filed back in May of 2018 - Price slowly went down.

S-1/A was changed and made it even worse back in June 2018 - Price went down much further.

S-1 Finally went into effect on July 11, 2018, Hard drop in price.

What brought it under $1 was the dreaded 10-K it had with not so good results.

I would add a footnote to your original post notating you‚Äôve not done your DD as you stated in @thatguyfromdeadpool subthread. 

You would have better odds and pay out playing roulette. Hopes and prayers won‚Äôt make a stock go, even if they‚Äôre doing something as noble as curing cancer. Doesn‚Äôt matter to the banks when their loans come due and they don‚Äôt have cash. 

Or they do another offering after pumping the stock and the price surges, which is likely to be followed by an offering and reverse-split to meet listing standards for $1.00 share price minimum since they‚Äôre subject to being delisted from NASDAQ.

Or worse even yet, they don‚Äôt do that and get delisted which will make the share price tank. Then figure in that brokerages like RobinHood and WeBull won‚Äôt allow you to trade OTC penny stocks, so those holding onto them in such brokerages would be unable to exit their positions and likely don‚Äôt have the cash to transfer them to a brokerage which allows OTC since they usually require a $2,000 account minimum deposit to open. Basically rendering such people‚Äôs investment worthless and becoming a digital paper weight.

Every stock has stocks that came before it and there is rarely anything new that changes things. Those are rare as rare. This company is in the cure business. They need capital to sustain the trials. They have done a bad job at delivering on the promised value and as the guy above just mentioned the way out of a delisting death spiral is a reverse split.

A deadweight loss, also known as excess burden or allocative inefficiency, is a loss of economic efficiency that can occur when the free market equilibrium for a good or a service is not achieved. That can be caused by monopoly pricing in the case of artificial scarcity, an externality, a tax or subsidy, or a binding price ceiling or price floor such as a minimum wage.

The share price goes up when that happens, and in this case, essentially took fifty shares to give you one which opened the price 50x higher than what it was the day before.

So, day prior the R/S the price was 14¬¢. Now multiply that by 50.

(14¬¢ x 50 = $7)

The current price is now $6.18. The price was 22¬¢ just two days before the R/S which occurred at 14¬¢, or to lament on percent,  literally down 33% over the recent high it had just two days prior to r/s.

Meanwhile, intrinsic value of money that people had prior to the R/S is substantially lower due to this, which means they would have lost money had they followed your advice.

But glad you came back again to make your point (that you didn‚Äôt do you due diligence, then or now.)",2019-08-04
