6,LRDR up 2000% since I bought at 001. Reinstatement and merger still pending.,8aaxy9,sensicle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8aaxy9/lrdr_up_2000_since_i_bought_at_001_reinstatement/,18,30,"Hey everyone,

I know I've said it before but I'll say it again, LRDR is an awesome play. No dilution, running purely on anticipated catalysts (reinstatement, reverse merger, ticker change possible). When Joseph Arcaro acquired the company a couple weeks ago, the judge that signed off on it stated his plan was a ""very real and attractive package"". 

I'm not sure where it will go, but my bet would be a lot higher from current levels. His other play, WSML, just hit 50 cents today. Best part? It has a similar float. LRDR float is 100M.

I'm just surprised it hasn't been brought up at all around here.

Good luck!",2018-04-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8aaxy9/lrdr_up_2000_since_i_bought_at_001_reinstatement/

I am fairly new to stock market and i want to invest my few hundred dollars at this moment to get good money after a couple of decades.i found Robinhood app bit that seemed to be allowing only few stocks to buy.
