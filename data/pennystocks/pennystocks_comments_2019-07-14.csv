I also created a custom parameter in my stock scanner for ‚Äúmark %,‚Äù change, so I can see the gap up and down relative to the stocks closing prices percent, since the change % doesn‚Äôt update pre-market/after hours.

This video breaks down a similar method using thinkorswims custom scripting language so you can build an even more refined version of the scanner I mentioned;  https://youtu.be/2evGsdOjGuM

Their myopia product is more speculative but has potential to be absolutely massive in China if they can effectively market it there (and assuming it passes Phase 3 here).

I think part of the reason it has done poorly the last few months is because of changes to their first product, the eye moisturizer.  In their Q3 earnings call they discussed selling it OTC to consumers in the first half of 2019, but then in the Q4/Q1 earnings they pivoted to selling to doctor offices and pushed out the date to start selling to early 2020.  So basically they subtely delayed all revenue potential by one year.  They're also going to need cash for a manufacturing ramp at some point so I suspect they'll do another offering in 2020 for that.

The stock is reasonably priced here compared to future potential cash flows if they're successful, but it's going to require patience.  It might be 2021 before this really starts to pay off.",2019-07-14
