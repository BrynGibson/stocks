Trust me on this. FANG will go up way more than penny stocks would. 

Just use leverage on FANG if you think that the returns aren‚Äôt enough. (If you‚Äôre in the US then buy calls). 

Never let yourself get margin called. Make sure your broker knows that you don‚Äôt want a margin account. 


You need a job besides day trading. If you don‚Äôt want to work at MCdonalds then do a paper route, mow lawns or sell lemonade. Idk, just do what you can to get other sources of income.

First thing you want to know is that everyone acts in their own interest. Webinars and all that other jazz are only going to help those running them. My advice is to educate yourself by other means. Look at open source education via MIT (specifically Financial Theory I and II) it will give you unbiased info and actually educate you rather than tell you what to do with YOUR money.,2018-08-05
