1,Mh55262,ea7r2co,/r/pennystocks/comments/9zazup/rgse_opinions/ea7r2co/,1,"I’m heavily in RSGE. Everything I’ve seen so far seems to be on the up and up. Really positive sentiment around the stock overall. Basically seem to be in the right place at the right time with not much competition at thier price range in the solar shingle market with only other real player being Tesla.Thier products are scheduled to come to market soon and thier ceo expects them to be profitable starting early next year. They just passed a key certification and are pretty much cleared for coming to market with thier products. 
     I expect RSGE to slowly trend upward over the next few months with big jumps when product starts shipping, then once again when thier first profits are reported. It’s market cap is small (30ish million) so even capturing a fraction of the market should produce huge gains. It’s risky, production problems or something of the sorts could set them back. Although they don’t have huge debt and seem fairly healthy so no immediate threat if minor problems occur. Just my opinion but 1 by end of year and 3 to 4 (300 million cap) If first profits show up in first quarter but I’m basing that on absolutely nothing but my gut. In the end , it’s a huge gamble but if everything pans out, I can’t see the leading company in solar shingles not being a billion dollar company. That comes down to management and how aggressive they are though.",2018-11-22
2,Karmais_a_bitch,ea7rzal,/r/pennystocks/comments/9zazup/rgse_opinions/ea7rzal/,1,"Yes, as long as the company doesn’t drop the ball here, this is a winner. Assuming that they were really on the up and up about 38 builders reserving 190 million worth of future product for 2019. They have set the expectation for their very next earnings report to be making a profit. As long as they have some of these purchases on the books, then with every earnings release this puppy should pump good. I have been watching and waiting for this run to take off for about 6 months. The market just did the math based on the reservations and we are currently on our ride up. Hold on tight. Between this and $NLST, it’s gonna be a fun December! Oh and $MAXR is another for a good quick run up this month. Usually, It’s always a good sign when lots of employees are buying the company shares. Thank me later. ",2018-11-22

I like the increase in employee ownership but even after the rise the company is only 0.71% institutionally owned. 

I don't get the hype train for this stock. They've consistently operated at a loss since 2015. Their CEO is a hype man. Their new product is a reboot of something Dow stopped producing in 2016.
