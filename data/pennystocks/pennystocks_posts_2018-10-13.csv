0,Is there a website where it shows an archive of people 'calling it'?,9nphfr,suveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nphfr/is_there_a_website_where_it_shows_an_archive_of/,1,23,"I am so interested in when people take a gamble and actually make a lot of profit in a stock. I am wondering if there is a some sort of DB that shows examples of people 'calling it'. I have heard of other websites that show what big investors are currently investing in, such as ceo.com, but is there one that shows where people made really good investments? Perhaps (and preferably) a reddit archive? I know its a silly request, but I am just so god damn curious to see how the winners thought at the time of investment.

3,Don’t invest into stocks listed on the OTC Markets,9nwp56,TheBornSnake,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nwp56/dont_invest_into_stocks_listed_on_the_otc_markets/,1,26,"As every investor knows, there are multiple different markets in where thousands of stocks are traded each day. The problem is a lot of investors end up going for penny stocks on the OTC Markets, which is a huge mistake. For the most part, most OTC stocks are less than a dollar. Now, there are some good OTC stocks and there are some OTC stocks that should be traded above a dollar. Rarely this is the case for stocks less than a dollar on the OTC Markets. First off, let’s discuss why companies even trade on the OTC Markets. From what I have read and heard, companies on the OTC Markets don’t meet the required regulations that the bigger markets like NASDAQ, AMEX, and NYSE require. Most of the companies are less of quality and don’t regularly report with the SEC as the regulations on the OTC Markets are lax. For this, Pink Sheets and Gray Sheets shouldn’t even be touched or looked at in the first place. Pink Sheets are horrible as most companies just report the good news and never do quarterly earnings while the Gray market is bad since those companies can’t even make the Pink Market. Trust me, buying and selling stocks on these two markets are literally gambling. Now, we move onto the OTCQB and OTCQX exchanges which are higher up but still don’t have strict regulations/requirements like other exchanges including Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX have. I forgot to mention some companies on the OTCQB and OTCQX are also listed on a foreign exchange, like FSDDF for example. If you’re looking for good penny stocks to buy, NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, and the OTC-BB (Owned by NASDAQ) all have much stricter regulations and requirements for all their stocks. You can also find 100’s of penny stocks on these exchanges which are really good. So, in conclusion, never trade on dark or defunct markets. All OTC Market stocks should all be avoided even including the “good” ones. If you’re new, I recommend start by paper trading.

7,$NHPI - an undervalued gem?,9nvsm4,opashire987,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nvsm4/nhpi_an_undervalued_gem/,1,0,"NHPI has recently ran from .0001 to a new 52 week high of .0018 friday. Accumulation has been very heavy the last couple of weeks. I personally loaded nhpi at .0013 friday as I am expecting a much bigger run this fall. Here is my thoughts on why I think this could run to much higher levels.

&amp;#x200B;

NHPI has a current float of only 880 million. This is not high for an OTC stock. For comparison, there are stocks that have run to multi pennies with over 1.5billion shares in the float.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some DD that makes this ticker especially interesting - [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=144075097](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=144075097)

&amp;#x200B;

FDA speculation. No dilution or debt. Small float. About to go current.

&amp;#x200B;

Every year, there are several OTC stocks that run from .0001 to multi pennies. $ANDI $LDSR are a couple recent ones that went on huge runs and gave massive gains. I believe $NHPI is the next to make a massive run, and I bet big on it. Lots of great OTC traders in on this play, check the cashtag on twitter for reference. This float is getting locked up at this levels. .01 is a realistic target, especially if this goes current.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not investment advice, and you should do your own research as always. This is currently a speculative play, but thats how all the big runners have started. The chart is telling a story, this came out of the trips and is holding these levels. Very rare, and when this happens, there is usually much more upside.

8,The .000 Penny stock of the week on OTC Markets!,9nvbp0,TheBornSnake,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nvbp0/the_000_penny_stock_of_the_week_on_otc_markets/,1,7,"Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals Incorporation (NOUV)  is my .000 penny stock pick of the week. Before I begin, Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals isn’t a good company. In fact, I don’t think that Nouveau even functions anymore as a company. You may now ask, what makes this stock the pick of the week then? My answer to you is Puration (PURA) and their relation with Nouveau. Now, Puration is a company that produces drinks and has been getting a lot of interest recently since they produce cannabis related drinks. How does Puration have to do with Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals? Well, basically, for every 5 Puration shares that you may buy, you will receive 1 Nouveau share. I believe they call this a spinoff. Anyways, what this has created is a lot of volume surrounding Nouveau in the last month ever since Puration announced their deal with Nouveau. This has caused Nouveau to have consistent volume throughout the day and a lot of volume for that fact. On Friday, October 12th, Nouveau traded 553.40M shares compared to their average of 88.96M shares in the last three months. Nouveau has also shot up 400% in the last month and up to 700% at times this week because of this. The volume indicates it has the capability to go up I believe. Like myself, I have been looking for a .000 penny stock that has A. Consistent Volume and B. A lot of volume and some news behind it recently. Nouveau fits these standards. I think it has the possibility to go up to the 0.00’s soon. You may also think it’s almost nearly impossible for that to happen. Well, in fact, I observed Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. (SWET) go from $0.0003 to $0.0031 in the span of two months. Ever since then, I have been trying to find the next 0.000 penny stock that has the potential to do so (I’ve looked a lot and most companies barely trade through the day and have no news surrounding them or hype, like $AZFL) and Nouveau is possibly the next one. Just think, if you put in $100 into SWET when it was $0.0003 and sold at $0.0031, you made 3000%+ gains! So, to conclude, there is no such thing as a good 0.000 penny stock but there is a such thing as a penny stock worth 0.000 that can go up. Nouveau isn’t a good company but certainly has the potential to go up big. Be on the look out for the next week. Until then, I will keep you all updated on it! 
Note: I own no shares in Nouveau and certainly recommend that only those who know they can lose their money invest in Nouveau. Any 0.000 OTC market stock is a gamble. ",2018-10-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nvbp0/the_000_penny_stock_of_the_week_on_otc_markets/
