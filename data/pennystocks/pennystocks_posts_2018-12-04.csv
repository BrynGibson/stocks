PHOENIX, Dec. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- [Alpine 4 Technologies Ltd](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X6oeq5o4O9o9IfQnvsQM17vZi7oWUTiCogH4JTzmr_lovntrkC0sVR_s5tz6iAW9vaS0yzIO8nfNWNtaUhjMeb5yA9wyZ36GXvWWr_HWYao=).

The company posted quarterly revenue of $4.79 million, which is growth of 115% over Q3 2017's revenue of $2.22 million.  


Kent B. Wilson, CEO of Alpine 4, had this to say: ""The growth for 2018 has been remarkable. Capitalizing on that growth in Q2 and Q4 2018, Alpine 4 began a set of initiatives to enhance our infrastructure both at the corporate level and at our subsidiary level. While these initiatives have a causal effect on our profit and loss statement, they will also allow Alpine 4 to more than double in size over the next 12 months and release what we call Kinetic Profit at each of our subsidiaries. Many of you have heard about our acquisition model of DSF (Driver Stabilizer and Facilitator), but we also employ what we call Optimization vs. Asset Producing as a means to define where a subsidiary is at in its life-cycle with Alpine 4. When a new subsidiary is acquired, it goes through a period of Optimization where we as a company define the ""What Is"", ""What Should Be"" and ""What Will Be"". This process is designed to deliver two main things. First, gained efficiency through enhanced management training and second, to release a company's potential profit or what we call Kinetic Profit. In 2018, we have made great strides towards moving all of our subsidiaries into what we call Asset Producing.

Earnings by Subsidiary Breakdown:

Quality Circuit Assembly (QCA): QCA's electronics contract manufacturing sales accounted for 61% of Alpine 4's quarterly revenue with $2.91 million in sales. QCA posted an EBITDA profit of $582k and a net profit of $337k for Q3 2018.

American Precision Fabricators (APF): APF's precision sheet metal manufacturing sales accounted for 25% of Alpine 4's quarterly revenue with $1.2 million in sales.

Venture West Energy Services (VWES): VWES had 10% of revenue or $452k thousand.

ALTIA: ALTIA rounded the remaining revenue at $231,212 or 4%.

Alpine 4 is providing the following revenue guidance for its Q4 2018:

ROSEVILLE, Calif., Dec. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. ([OTCQB](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4K9hhGggRRqv94X24UhGlYXQUcn7SbSWA8Wt2Vnq3VC2c4xTeK5Un_hleRNJEuIJXgbv-wdMx-c23mZuNHAwAIlE7PsjiaCN94ZKEGhY-QbbVYx8OYt2QEyzabhO6zznlsjofXtUP1yN2vzFLhb6y7he2RJQrCPgIdV3ME8NWu8=)[:](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8UAJgPbL6GdQBSGuduDLanb_RLGYrbJ-794CDKXXl9ZjyKpRiL8PzhgVaYEpeTYQGfmONW3RClIizp2BHQYwxZRsojMVycXRf8sSIy6dg9O2WOSNLkeOBPejzzK2hhylX5mNR-IPp0JCsf4RI8fkcg==)[INND](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_P6Sl4kqEyK5xP4fOdlB09o9xHS7yrsPK-wOtUjJ-NpDh3Bmb0Sxix9Atd-sdJkua9_bgGyoO-3idwFdnGXijGnnpJ0IJzFluglWndoIU8_YygghpCJ-BcxnnNBtBagHrkbNAoMSijR8HpHHJpou67nLlhv7Ds52qc-2_NJVTOc=)), a manufacturer and direct-to-consumer distributor of hearing aids and related hearing products, announces it has signed a lease for a new corporate owned audiological hearing aid retail clinic located in Sacramento, California (the ""Sac Clinic""). The opening of the Sac Clinic, dba [Value Audiology &amp; Hearing Aid Center](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7DTkLCFzfQ9qqaF56PeAQrJeD6FBt6QBKfHCSZZpveBuX7Xf7tYZrpFgkNQaiT4NFGGCree7eEFqMbII5OcagH2AIANewkNFYnQOfrhxtMqgSkU5rRwJLJB8bu1zAl09) is part of InnerScope's 6 to 12 month Northern California Audiological Clinic Expansion Plan, (the ""Rollout Plan"") as previously announced. The Sac Clinic will give InnerScope a total of 5 corporate owned audiological hearing aid retail clinics in Northern California (""Retail Clinics"") (includes Value Hearing Aid Center's two location pending acquisition) out of the 22 Retail Clinics in the Rollout Plan with expected total gross revenue from the 5 locations in hearing aid sales to exceed $3.2 million in annual revenue with a 20% to 30% EBITA.

&amp;#x200B;

InnerScope anticipates the Sac Clinic will be opened and fully operational by the end of December 2018. InnerScope is confident the Sac Clinic is going to be one of the highest producing revenue locations of the Retail Clinics. The Sac Clinic is located in one of the areas that have the highest density of senior population in the Sacramento region. Given that the founders of InnerScope have 30+ years owning and operating Retail Clinics in the Sacramento region and with one of their previous locations being in that exact area as the Sac Clinic location, InnerScope expects the Sac Clinic to produce annual revenues exceeding $1.2m in gross sales with approximately $200 to $300k in net profit. InnerScope has already trained and hired the experienced and licensed hearing healthcare professional for the Sac Clinic.

With InnerScope successfully delivering on its Rollout Plan combined with its Retail Clinic acquisitions and its eCommerce DTC online stores, (including [Walmart.com for InnerScope's hearing aids](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wAKLU5s4_O-ASjPuFETwlXw7UJtmtaXvKzQ3FaO_z1p7noTtORS0nSowYjiBIdD4ZtszWP3bS79s6K5afsFUiwDJz0Q6KY7SOrIY2Sjv2FGX_BSJclQ2TpG0jnQgr4AOAyWgJZtJffGFL_4RSjc7XeSZKC12zh1qBpTTuHbEzzmxn1QpWxWG0A6y85XTVWgA)) InnerScope is planning to be able to meet the listing requirements for up listing to the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. InnerScope anticipates reporting healthy profits in the coming quarters, which will help InnerScope to meet all of the requirements including the $5 million in Stockholders Equity, the number of Shareholders, and the Market Value of Publicly Held Shares.

""InnerScope is continuing to push the traditional hearing aid distribution boundaries in the U.S. by providing consumers several options to purchase hearing aids at factory direct prices,"" said Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies. ""InnerScope is successfully building two separate Direct-to-Consumer (""DTC"") hearing aid distribution channels, an eCommerce DTC online hearing aid stores and DTC Retail Clinics. Despite, both of the channels are DTC distribution channels, which offer the same factory direct prices; the sales and delivery process are very different. InnerScope's DTC eCommerce online hearing aid stores (includes [Walmart.com for InnerScope's hearing aids](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wAKLU5s4_O-ASjPuFETwlXw7UJtmtaXvKzQ3FaO_z1p7noTtORS0nSowYjiBIdD4A87aZwfZ6V_pXeYrg1h2btdXbhenccSPD3OO8fQJGzZ7fUlNfV9yHLJPv13NxwU_cdYOpY96zO9J6EANHEKh6wuD10w6gTmfdjOMdB4RV4i-cnzRuhPBq3D5jynu6hzE)) provides a modern day innovative approach for consumers to access and purchase high quality hearing aids online shipped directly to their home without seeking a hearing care professional. However, InnerScope's DTC Retail Clinics provides the more traditional brick and mortar hearing aid sales and delivery model, which the senior population still tends to gravitate towards since there has been no other options,"" continued Mr. Moore.

""We believe InnerScope, with its two DTC distribution channels, is on the forefront of creating a paradigm shift within the industry, not only how hearing aids are sold and delivered to the consumer, but also how hearing health issues will be delivered in the future. Although, currently most of the $4 to $5 billion in annual U.S. hearing aid sales (approximately only 2 million people purchasing every year of the potential 48 million that may benefit using hearing aids) comes from the 15,000+ brick and mortar hearing aid clinics. Which is the reason we are confident in knowing InnerScope's Retail Clinics will generate immediate revenue and market share. With every Retail Clinic we open in any market with the manufacturing agreement that we have with Zounds Hearing Inc., will give us a big competitive edge over every other hearing aid retailer in the market. The competitors just can't compete with the retail price points and margins we have on our hearing aid products nor with the numerous media marketing agreements and hearing aid sales experience that InnerScope possesses. This will allow InnerScope to continue to grow market share with every new or acquired Retail Clinic,"" Mr. Moore concluded.",2018-12-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a32x9x/innd_innerscope_hearing_technologies_inc/
