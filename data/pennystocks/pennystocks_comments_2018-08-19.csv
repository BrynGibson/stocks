37,TraderNorm,e4hlpt2,/r/pennystocks/comments/98htre/finding_legit_pennystocks/e4hlpt2/,1," **How can you find legit penny stocks that will turn into huge companies?** 

There's no easy answer to this. It takes a lot of practice and due diligence to learn the things to spot. Doing homework on the company any which way you can and learning to decipher the truth from the hype and lies. Basically expect to put in years of learning on the job to develop an eye for good penny plays, but everyone will have a different approach.

 **What websites do you guys use to research and find out about Penny Stocks?** 

I am mainly a chart trader so I use scanning software (EquityFeed is my software of choice for the past 10+ years) to look through hundreds of charts every day. When I find something that catches my eye I dig deeper into the company and if I like what I see I may watch it closely on a watchlist. I also have a small group of traders and we share trade ideas and due diligence with one another, that helps a lot.

 **Who are the most credible authorities that cover everything Penny Stocks?** 

I assume no one is trustworthy until they prove otherwise, and even if someone means well there's a good chance they're wrong or handing out bad advice. My rule of thumb is if someone is telling you what to play and how to play it, they're dishing out something I don't want. The only acceptable advice that I want to hear to prove someone is credible in the penny world is 'trust no one and learn things for yourself'. If you find someone telling you that, they're right on. 

 **Are Penny Stocks only pump and dump schemes?** 

Not all of them, but even the legit companies are subject to all sorts of volatility and spikes/collapses. I tend to assume the worst in most cases.

 **What applications and services do you use to find, buy, and sell Penny Stocks?** 

I've been using EquityFeed since 2006. It's not cheap ($100 - $200 per month depending on the options) but if you are going to trade for a living it's a tool you need. Whether you use this program or something else, you need software that will help you effortlessly scan through many charts in a short period of time. There are cheaper options than EF but it's my favorite tool. I also take advantage of having a small group of traders I trade with ([ChartDiligence.com](https://ChartDiligence.com)) - we all share our trade ideas and charts we like and that helps because numerous pairs of eyes scanning the market are better than one pair.

My parting advice is to embrace using charts first and foremost. At first you'll have no clue what the hell you're doing but in time reading a chart will be like learning a foreign language. Stock promoters, pumpers, and random message board posters lie and BS but a chart will show you the reality of what the price action is saying. At first you will have no idea what a chart is saying but the longer you study them and watch them in action, the more they will speak to you. After years of practice you will begin to speak charteese fluently and you will be able to make your trading/investing decisions with more confidence than when you were following random internet posters.",2018-08-19
