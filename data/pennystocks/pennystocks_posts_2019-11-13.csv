SCOTTSDALE, AZ ‚Äì November 13, 2019 ‚Äì IZON Network, Inc. (OTC: IZNN), also known as IZON Digital Media Network (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), is pleased to announce the release of its newest technology offering: IZON VRE (Virtual Real Estate). Now in addition to reaching golfers on IZON‚Äôs in-cart screen solution, advertisers will now be able to also hyper-target golfers through their personal mobile device while they are on the golf course. IZON has built a virtual fence around each golf course in the United States in order to know when each mobile phone device ID is on the property specifically during a round of golf. This will allow for the delivery, in real time, for an Advertisers targeted message to be directed to the golfers Smartphone.

‚ÄúWith our core focus of delivering a Premium audience to all of our Advertisers, IZON VRE was the logical next product on our development roadmap to roll out to answer the demand from the Digital Out of Home Ad agencies.‚Äù said Tim Ummel, CEO of IZON. ‚ÄúMultiple companies offer basic geo targeting and consumer retargeting, but almost all have no vertical expertise. IZON‚Äôs Team knows the golf vertical better than any other digital media company and has the ability to discern between courses not only geographically, but down to specific course types, exact time &amp; length of play, seasonality and provides Advertisers a very robust backend proprietary analytics dashboard to see real-time reporting of all Ad placements. IZON has literally mapped and geo-fenced all 15,000 plus golf courses in the United States, which are now available to all of our Advertising clients via our IZON REACH platform.‚Äù

IZON Digital Media Network is a proprietary media &amp; entertainment platform for premium &amp; niche marketplaces which targets premium captive digital out-of-home audiences. There is significant demand for access to high end consumers by National brands &amp; Advertisers. IZON focuses its efforts within the Digital Out-of-Home vertical where an expanding premium user base already exists for the longest dwell times and can be engaged utilizing its digital media network including golf and premium transportation. Due to IZON‚Äôs offering this drives the greatest amount of margin and topline revenue from National Brands &amp; Advertisers.

Tim Ummel continued, ‚ÄúWith this technology, IZON can now provide advertisers a direct targeted premium audience of the estimated 26 million golfers in the United States while they are at the golf course. This hyper-targeting should allow IZON to obtain significantly higher CPM rates as Advertisers and their agencies begin to use the platform‚Äù
