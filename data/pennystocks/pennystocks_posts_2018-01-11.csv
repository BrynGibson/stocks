6,The perfect bet for 10x-100x gains or 50% losses on this small biotech play with a billion dollar drug in stage 2 clinical trials,7pl6di,TRichard5555,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7pl6di/the_perfect_bet_for_10x100x_gains_or_50_losses_on/,13,19,"Antibe Therepeutics is a Canadian biotech company with a market cap around 30 milllion dollars. They have a few drugs in the pipeline utilizing a hydrogen sulfide molecule drug release technology. 

The first and most important drug is a replacement for regular naproxen the most common anti-inflammatory drug used to help in osteoarthritis and other diseases. The market for this drug is around 1-5 billion dollars and it could potentially dominate it if it works effectively as it is 2 times as effective as naproxen and causes no gastrointestinal damage or high blood pressure (like other drugs in the industry).

The drug is in phase 2b clinical trials on humans with health Canada (hard to get to) and the results are expected to come out within the next few months. If these results are positive expect a dollar share price and if stage 3 clinical trials are solid it will go mass market and you may see gains beyond your wildest dreams.

8,Reasons to invest in HMNY,7pminc,levishazam,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7pminc/reasons_to_invest_in_hmny/,18,19,"Just to disclose, I have a large position in HMNY and have been invested since $2.30 price point. 

These are the reasons I think HMNY could quadruple in the new few months. 

1. Owns 70% of moviepass(Incase you didn’t know).

2. New app coming out soon and new website already released.

3. CEO started Netflix and Redbox, destroyed the dvd rental industry.

4. Moviepass has struck a deal with a movie studio doing direct advertising, essentially motivating 1.5 million to see a specific film. I believe this will evolve into larger studios, imagine if universal had access to promote a film directly to millions of people. 
http://www.slashfilm.com/moviepass-i-tonya/

5. Movie theaters have started advertising moviepass at their doors to boost business.

6. Over 500k subscribers added this month, mostly due to word of mouth. This could explode into swallowing up a majority of the movie industry, I imagine we’ll be in the ballpark of 10 millions by end of year.

7.  New tax legislation could allow moviepass to write off losses as “gifts” .

8. Mitch lowe stated that movie pass will have a positive cash flow in the next 60 days. 

9. Deal with Costco.

10. Mention of possible ICO in the future.

There is so much growth ahead of this company and I believe it Is severely undervalued. I think we will see 40$ in the new few months. 


I know this isn’t technically a penny stock anymore, but I found this company on this board, so I thought I’d return to spread some information. 


Good luck!

My 2 cents:  
Atypical for this sub in that it is slightly lower risk than some of the other stocks listed here (although it's still volatile) and is not meant to be a ""pump and dump"", but rather a bet on an industry that could see some growth. I'm looking to double my money with it as opposed to making a stratospheric gain. I'm putting a few hundred into it as an acorn in my modest portfolio. Don't be stupid and go all in on this or any of the stocks listed on this sub.

The clinical trial, which outlines the treatment of up to 30 patients undergoing various types of liver resection, will take place at two major liver surgery centers in The Netherlands. Subject to the MREC approvals, the Company anticipates that patients will be treated with the Xcede Patch in the Netherlands in early 2018. Xcede has contracted with their manufacturer Cook Biotech Inc. (CBI), to execute the study and make the appropriate regulatory and ethical committee submission on behalf of Xcede Technologies.

Today's news followed shortly after Xcede's announcement of completing their required ISO 10993-1 Testing Program. ""We are very excited to announce this clinical trial submission and significant milestone in the development of the Xcede Patch,"" said Linda Zuckerman, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xcede Technologies., Inc. ""We continue to execute on our development plan for the Patch.""

""An extensive amount of testing and data analysis was necessary to support this dossier, all of which was supervised by the CBI and Xcede teams. While lengthy, this process was thorough and very professionally done,"" said Peter Sulick, Dynasil's Chairman and CEO. ""We are encouraged by this step and look forward to the successful completion of the trials and eventual launch of the product, initially in Europe.""

Xcede is committed to the development and manufacturing of innovative hemostatic and sealant products for surgical application including severe, traumatic bleeding.
