11,The problem with new traders and penny Bio Stocks. Just some advice from an experienced trader. $AKER $JAGX $BPMX.. Ect...,836qd9,IGOSODAMNHAM,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/836qd9/the_problem_with_new_traders_and_penny_bio_stocks/,49,38,"I have seen this for a long time, and new traders always gravitate towards Bio stocks, but not the legit ones, the shitty Bioturds. They see these tiny stocks get some type of news and have crazy gains so they are in search of the next one. They think they are way smarter than they are, they fall for all the hype and won't listen to anyone and have this pipe dream of their stock doing well. There is a reason these Bio stocks are this low. They have no cash, their product has flaws or competition, their share structure is disgusting, their board are incompetent at running a company ect...

Lets start with $JAGX. The reason this one moved up so much is as simple as looking at the chart. This thing has been on a down trend for 3 years. It was over $7 in 2015 and went down to .11 (it looks like it touched .01 but I am not sure if that was a darkpool print or a read sell off day so I will ignore that). Off course on some RANDOM NOT PRICED IN news you see a pop, and it only went up to .34ish from .14.

https://imgur.com/OepGTrL

$AKER was a play on the chart. No one gives a shit about this FDA approval. If they get approved you might see small pop, but it will sell off after that. As I posted yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/82y073/aker_a_break_under_60_and_this_falls_to_at_least/)
if this fell below .60 you would see at least .55. It hit .55 on the dot. I expect more sell offs to come still.

https://imgur.com/aoO7QgT

Yesterday was the first time this stock closed under the 13EMA since this run up has started. Bearish. If somehow this can get a bunch of buyers to bump this back up and rebreak out of the wedge... that is Bulls only hope. Another pipe dream.



$BPMX - This was at .01 then above .35. I would never buy this unless it can rebreak .35 with strength. This has run way too far and has so much priced in it's not even funny.


*********************
No one should be playing bio tech stocks unless they are playing off the charts for fast swings/flips.
If you are holding these for FDA approval, sorry, but you are ignorant.
The only reason you should be holding these drugs for approval is if you have a background in Bio and know how to read all the studies/Abstracts and know the ins and outs of the drug world. You should also be able to read all the financials and know the experience of board members.

No, these people who just started trading did not find a Bio gem at pennies that is going to dollars. No, it's not happening.

Here’s some other DD I’ve done, a lot to read but well worth it:


https://www.data443.com


1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.” 

About Cybersecurity Insiders 
The Cybersecurity Excellence Awards are organized and managed by the team at Cybersecurity Insiders – the same group that manages the 400,000+ member information security technology professional LinkedIn group. The organization also produces numerous webinars and deep industry research for all facets of information security. It is headquartered in Maryland, US. 

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html






4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

So basically, N8 Identity inc chooses the best of the best solutions, and the best of the best companies go to them for their solutions, and here is proof that the CEO of N8 identity supports Jason and ClassiDocs. I am not by any means saying Metlife, Allstate and TD Ameritrade will be ClassiDocs customers, however I am saying that when they look for GDPR, they will go to N8 Identity for help. ClassiDocs may not get chosen but it will have potential access to thousands of businesses. 

and last of all, here is a link to an invite FROM JAY ODONNEL AND JASON REMILLARD TOGETHER inviting people to demo ClassiDocs.. Further proof of a good relationship and support for ClassiDocs from one of the world's largest solution providers with the a very large list of clients.

16,Why I played penny stocks,832blj,zachdaddy84,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/832blj/why_i_played_penny_stocks/,74,21,"I guess I've seen the question over and over.

And it sounds like we don't know what we're doing. And, at least in my case, I really didn't know. But it was what I could afford at the time.

I didn't make much at the time. I had a job that paid not much over minimum wage. But I worked smart. I saved smart. Started saving money little by little.

I never made much money on penny stocks. I think my highest net income from penny stocks was around $500 from an initial investment of $90.

But. Oh and its a big but. I learned so very much from researching stocks that I carry that knowledge into today. I have a very decent paying job that allows me to actually purchase non-sub $1 stocks after careful research that I learned from penny stock world.

I hope that people don't just 100% invest from this sub solely based on something someone posted to get a little boost, but because they did their education dive. Because they did their research and understood what was in store for the company they invested in.

For those who are posting because you did your due diligence, cheers to you. For those who are successful because of folks who allowed you the info to research, cheers to you.

Life is about learning. That will never stop. Never hesitate to ask questions. It's a privilege that we can do that to better ourselves",2018-03-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/832blj/why_i_played_penny_stocks/

The President/CFO retired/cancelled his 1.6 billion shares to lower the O/S, and they have also identified fraudulent trading activities according to their press release from today.
