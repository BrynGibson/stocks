The equipment is currently operational and has begun its first run of pods manufactured entirely In-House.

Baristas new in-house manufacturing capabilities will also aid in and accelerate the development of its new products and allow Baristas to partner with others who wish to bring their products to the single-serve beverage market. 

Baristas will now be able to market its products with confidence that it will be able to keep up with demand and fulfill orders and a new marketing push is being implemented along with the new manufacturing capabilities.

LAUDERDALE, Fla., Sept. 11, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardiff Lexington (OTC: CDIX)  Cardiff Lexington, a public holding company, today announced that the Company has received $410,000.00 in new funding from the Private Equity Group, Leonite Capital, LLC. The parties entered into a 12-month conventional note. This capital infusion was arranged  by the registered Broker Dealer Craft Capital, LLC to stop the current convertible note dilution of Cardiff Lexington common stock and in an attempt to stabilize the share price of the Company.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Cardiff has paid-off three significant convertible notes totaling $379,902 and plans to retire all commercial notes by year end 2019 in concert with acquisition related equity funding. This move consolidates Company debt with essentially two friendly lenders Leonite Capital LLC and Greentree Financial, LLC both of whom have invested prior, are committed to future equity participations,  and are aligned and committed to Cardiff Lexington’s future goals and objectives.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alex Cunningham, CEO/President of Cardiff Lexington, stated: “The elimination of troubling debt conversions from our balance sheet and move to an equity blend of financing should have a positive effect to help strengthen the value of our company and our common share market price. Paying off this currently converting convertible debt, will dramatically ease troubling dilution which has consistently put extreme pressure on our common stock price.  Our goal is to continue to reward our shareholders and new investors of Cardiff Lexington by organic growth through an increasing common stock price and expanding our revenue streams through new acquisitions including real estate and companies vertically and horizontally aligned with the CBD Oil Medical Hemp business. ”  “These moves combined with our  pending potential Acela BioMedical acquisition  in my opinion will immediately validate our higher standing within the small cap market segment as we continue to gain national attention of our business strategy as one of the more stable innovative fully reporting Companies in our industry,” further stated Cunningham.  
&gt;  
&gt;About Cardiff Lexington Corporation: Cardiff Lexington is a public holding company, much like a cooperative, leveraging proven management in private companies that   become subsidiaries. Our focus is not industry or geographic-specific, but rather proven management, market, and margin. Cardiff Lexington targets acquisitions of mature, high growth, niche companies.

**Mobeen Javed, CEO of BONUM HEALTH commented, ""BONUM HEALTH is dedicated to provide patients with effective and affordable healthcare services, including hearing healthcare products and services. We are excited to include InnerScope's Hearing Kiosks and its many affordable Hearing Products as part of our many healthcare services we offer.  InnerScope's Hearing Kiosks will be one of many key healthcare service components of BONUM HEALTH's new ""Bonum Health Hubs"" that will help revolutionize the 23,000+ independent pharmacies in the U.S. by offering a ""one stop shop"" for the majority of healthcare services. BONUM HEALTH HUB's located inside local pharmacies, will offer services to include, Hearing, Men/Women Health, Dental, Wellness, Education, Tele-Health and Testing Services. Currently, we are deploying BONUM HEALTH HUBs in Benzer Pharmacies in several states and we will be adding many more independent pharmacies over the next months.""**

InnerScope's Hearing Kiosks are ultimately part of BONUM HEALTH's overall plan to offer hearing healthcare services within its newly developed Bonum Health Hubs to be located inside thousands of independent pharmacies across the country.  The Bonum Health Hub is a stand-alone healthcare model that gives the public one place to conveniently receive a variety of health related services. In addition, Bonum Health Hubs will offer access to healthcare that some consumers may not have. 

***""We are excited and thrilled about the Agreements with BONUM HEALTH and InnerScope being a key component of the Bonum Health Hubs,"" said Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies. ""We know how important it is for the public to have easy and affordable access to proper healthcare services. We also believe Hearing Healthcare should be an essential part of any healthcare services offered.  That's why, we are so passionate about our Hearing Kiosks, it's the gateway to providing easy and affordable access to better hearing healthcare products and services in this country.""***

**""With the Hearing Kiosks driving the message of the potential multiple health and cognitive risks of untreated hearing loss coupled with the of ""Point of Sale"" function driving the sales, and given that 3 out of 5 people over 60 years of age has some hearing issues, we anticipate selling thousands of dollars of InnerScope's affordable Hearing Product Portfolio at each pharmacy location per month.  Once the first 120 out of the 200 Hearing Kiosks are deployed, we believe this not only gives InnerScope a competitive advantage over all other DTC hearing aid retailers, but also gives InnerScope a brand recognition of manufacturing and distribution of high quality affordable Hearing Products,"" concluded Mr. Moore.**
