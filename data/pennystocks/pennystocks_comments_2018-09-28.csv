Using a chart effectively is like learning a new language and I've been trading for 13 years now and what I look for is based on 13 years of experience and all sorts of subtle and not so subtle nuances. It would literally take me days of lecturing you to try to share what I look for specifically, but to summarize the basics I am looking for a strong chart that isn't too strong. That is to say that I see strength and the bulls are building significant momentum (which I plan to ride) but the stock also isn't up too much which adversely affects the risk to reward. 

&amp;#x200B;

CRMD has been knocking on a ceiling marking the 52 week high point and to my eyes looked right on the verge of busting through it, and when a key area of resistance is broken it's very common to see momentum and follow through, like today. Strong but not too strong is the key. Moving up to a key level of resistance (strong) but then consolidating first is a great event to learn to spot. The consolidation makes the stock not overbought and due for a pullback, but the simple fact that it's consolidating above it's prior trading ranges and just under resistance is a sign of strength. Subtle but strong is what I'm looking for.",2018-09-28
106,NormanMitis,e6tpgce,/r/pennystocks/comments/9jo9sm/wtf_hiph/e6tpgce/,1,"Welcome to the stock market where things don't operate how you think they should. If it were that straight forward and easy then everyone would do it and be rich. It doesn't work like that. Forget the news, HIPH just had a huge run and what you now calling tanking is so just a healthy pullback and consolidation of that move. Textbook, typical and standard. If it keeps going down and it loses all it's gains, then you can call it tanking. If you bought near the highs then you're getting a valuable lesson in not chasing a runner. If something has already ran hard without out, buying into that strength late in the game is a great way to lose money almost every time unless you get lucky. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trading is a damn hard thing to do and there's a steep learning curve. Most people jump in thinking they're geniuses, get their asses handed to them, then give up before they can ever learn from their mistakes. It's one of the toughest things I've ever done and the only reason I'm able to do it for a living is because I've made every mistake in the book 50 million times and luckily survived them to apply their lessons. So like I said in the first sentence, welcome to the stock market, where things don't operate how you think they should.",2018-09-28

After going through all of that you need to look at charts, look at them some more, and then even more. Practice. Pick charts that have a lot of volatility and try to find out why the upwards/downwards movements occurred. Just remember that catalyst trumps technical analysis every time: clinical drug trial failure/success, quarterly earnings reports etc. So drastic movements on the chart may be due to positive/negative catalysts.",2018-09-28
