Im salty as fuck as well JUST LIKE ALL OF YOU.

 But there are many stocks out there and this is the last one i would recommend but this is one of the only penny stocks i fuck with. i moved on to the options market.

But the infornation they are giving is really matching up with the presentation stated with MNGA -&gt; TRNX release. They have been using the profits towards expansion. And they setup ALOT of contracts.

 I dont know if anybody here welds or anything but me personally i have never seen metal be cut so clean and fast. Thats my reasoning for saying ""hey long hold this"" because its apparently 20% cheaper and a renewable source, and can potentially compete with propane, on top of a bunch of patents they own that deals with their gas and water filtration.

What im saying is instead of wasting your money on all these shit OTC stocks hoping that someone else would take on fake DD. Look at the facts and analyze this company as of july last year.

Im not asking you to buy 100k shares let alone 1 share. Yall can do as you please. I would rather have you guys buy AMD calls or something.. But i Recommend buying and holding like a real investment stock, not just to hope for a quick flip but literally let that shit sit.",2019-07-10

You ""borrow"" the card, but devious as you are, you sell it for the 100 right away. Tomorrow, if the card is worth 50, you can buy a new one for your friend and have 50 left over, thus profiting 50. 

However, you've made an agreement to give your friend back his card regardless of the price on a certain date. A fire burns down the warehouse that had most of the rest of the inventory of that card, and it triples in value. You're on the hook for the card, regardless, and so would have to spend 300 to give your friend his card back. 

If you had bought the card directly, you would own it, and the maximum damage you could incur is whatever you spent on the card. When you buy a put (or a call, which is the inverse - betting a stock will go up), you're putting unlimited money on the line.

Currently is .205 which i stated 2 days ago as prediction when stock was .26 but was .21 end of day last week, and then now the high .39 was cut into equation for the week, the following week should be about .2271/.24 as low support level due to high level bagholders from this week.

You should look up extrinsic value and intrinsic value, read about the Greeks. Important ones are theta and Delta, and Vega, along with the Implied volatility, and also you should look up the break even price. 

The further a strike price is from it's expiration date, the more extrinsic value it has, intrinsic value is based on the relationship of the strike to the stock price, extrinsic value is the additional value it has based on time and volatility. 

Look at SPY $300 call expiring Friday. It closed the day with a bid of .35, $35 for one call. The theta says .18, so if nothing else changes by 9:30 am tomorrow morning, it will be worth .17, $17 dollars, .35-.18 is .17.

Pump and dumps dont help the stock. 
They also took out a few loans/grants to benefit the company, for expansion and to level out the the profits lossed from payouts 

Now stock price, i can only say there are alot of people that bash the company, lots of people make fake twitter accounts and demoralize the stock saying its not safer than acetylene but realistically any pressurised gas container can explode, and any gas is dangerous to work with.

 So realistically other companies will look for cheaper more effecient fuel then acetylene which would be propane as #1 as of now, but Magnegas is 20%cheaper than propane and faster and more efficient(as they claim, but the video you can really see the difference when they cut the beam, it runs right through it)

Theyve been struggling up until last year to increase the stock. The recent drop(3 months ago) was due to TRNX thinking they closed an acquisition of a san diego contract location but they didnt officially seal the deal before announcing it which is very important because san diego is like Californias NYC.

3 splits once a year from 2017 2018 and february this year(announced in december 2018)

This is a really bad exampleim about to give but no different than Tesla. Because tesla had a faulty model 3 at the start, multiple caught fire and they went from 380 to 170 within 6 months, but the difference is that teslas stock wouldnt need an r/s because theyre already supplied with money

If this were to happen to NIO the way it happend to tesla im sure NIO would be a penny stock and R/s.

What i mean is that this is new technology in our era and its still trial and error, but based on the revenue numbers and the amount of years worked, it will be definitely ready by 2021 but i was thinking to make others aware.. This isnt meant to pump but its opportunity. 

If they were to do another R/s it would be a 1-25 guess. Because 2017 was 1-10, 2018 was 1-15, and recently was 1-20, but its really really unlikely. This is a Long hold commitment.
Look at these numbers.

A couple of weeks ago they [announced](https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/tango-announces-postponement-of-special-meeting-of) that they would postpone to an unspecified date their EGM, which, as you know, was to receive shareholder approval for their Kwena related-party divestment.

Seeing as how you've held the name for a bit, I was wondering if you knew what was up? Maybe resistance against the sale?  I mean, the 17% shareholder who proposed to buy the assets via share cancellation was valuing his stake at 5x the market price at the time.  If you value the shares at C$0.01 and couple the associated liability assumption, they were going to sell the assets for C$1.1 mil; the same PR mentioned an appraisal of C$2.3 mil as of a couple of years back.

btw, TAO.CN -- TAG Oil -- was an absolutely terrific find!  Just wanted to say thanks and congrats.  After the US$30.5m close of their New Zealand assets, the company is trading sub cash (including the C$7.2m already on their book), implying that you get a (1) potentially valuable 2.5% royalty on those assets at a negative cost (or free, depending on how you want to appraise/discount that book cash, above), and (2) a freeroll on a further US$4.5m in milestone payments.

The main risk is obviously mgmt doing something moronic with the new cash.  A longer run risk -- which might be discounted back by the market -- is a dilutive stock option plan (all currently OTM but they only last year issued a lot of C$0.5 options and have a pretty dilutive 10% of common outstanding plan in force).

I know diversification is all the rage but your TAG play merits even more possible consideration than Tango, esp at these prices and this setup.
