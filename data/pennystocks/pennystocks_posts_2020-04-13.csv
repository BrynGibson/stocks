0,What are your guys thoughts on Real Estate Investment Trust?,g09gfi,Milking-Camels,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g09gfi/what_are_your_guys_thoughts_on_real_estate/,1,2,"Here are my thoughts after doing some DD.

Earnings reports for these companies are coming out soon within 10-30 days for some of these companies like ORC, XAN, TWO, NYMT, and MFA. I feel like the situation with corona is only going to get worse and if more people get laid off then more people can't pay mortgage which can affect these companies that own real estate in apartment buildings, housing, malls, shopping centers, and hotels, etc...

I feel like people will ride these earnings report and get in because of FOMO which can make the price rise but if unemployment is increasing and people cant pay mortgage than who is going to be paying these companies? IMO I feel like these earnings reports are not going to meet expectations and make the stock drop.

Just my two cents but I want to hear others opinions on it.",2020-04-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g09gfi/what_are_your_guys_thoughts_on_real_estate/

This partnership will allow Americase to exclusively utilize KULR’s passive propagation resistant (PPR) technology and source the core materials from KULR to produce its patent pending Battery Bag to prevent lithium-ion battery thermal runaway propagation during storage and transportation.  


“Together, KULR and Americase are bringing the latest battery safety technology used by NASA on the International Space Station to mass commercial markets,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR. “We are very excited to partner with the industry leader, Americase, to achieve another milestone in bringing our space-proven technology to broad commercial battery markets.”

Proprietary Flame Proof Recovery Packaging developed and produced by Americase has been utilized for approximately 70% of DDR (Damaged, Defective, or Recalled) battery shipments in the industry, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall in 2016, as well as recalls for virtually every manufacturer of consumer electronics. In addition to creating the world’s most widely used return packaging for damaged or defective lithium batteries, Americase is one of the leaders in providing lithium battery transportation and storage solutions for large format batteries to some of the world’s largest automotive companies.

In 2019 NASA used KULR’s PPR solution to [**protect laptop computers**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M0EUcn3jnFjabIF6pfaP46vXredpgw1TnNG1X3FecmkJc4t44YkFTWoodYTTWmhDmB2u2Io7FbrJ8l1AxxFvUOHb_5YVdO4jjO9-AgaBfGOHHRTrD7uXKFGGHqbB9ogc7WuWEdWEnpYe0uJYtvFfqL1P9nX0OBYU4jOKnuEE9X9LFl6p4-8dPJHDiDgz6g7hvmuQvnm4RAEmlV4zHrw-aA==) onboard the International Space Station. KULR has collaborated with and is developing PPR solutions for a variety of government, military, research, and consumer applications.

“I believe KULR is one of the most advanced innovators of PPR technology, improving safety during shipment and storage of lithium-ion batteries -- especially for those with higher safety concerns created by manufacturing defects, physical damage, or exposure to specific elements such as heat or moisture,” said Robby Kinsala, CEO of Americase.

I was heavily invested in LRSV. Their company had an actual product, they communicated well. 

I originally bought and sold day trading in the .10 -15 range, and finally when it started falling I went all in with almost 115,000 shares at .05. 

Then in September the company went silent. Share price started dropping, but I held... through .04s, 03s.... You get the idea. 

The price today is .0025 

At this point, I'm not even worried about selling. I figure it'll eventually get bought by another company and hopefully make a little run and I'll be able to recoup some. 

I even bragged on the stock here a little. I feel bad for buying into the hype. 

Don't do what I did friends! Here's proof of my stupidity.
