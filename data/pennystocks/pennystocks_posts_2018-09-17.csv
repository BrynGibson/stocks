I am a novice trader trying to learn and grow as a trader and I'm trying to do research and kind of not getting the answers that I am looking for. I wanted to know how you create a watch list? Do you subscribe to a website that gives it to you? Do you look on a website and what website do you use? What strategies/plan do you use? And If you have an idea of a great course to help me learn and grow as a trader what course would it be? Or should I learn the ropes my self? Thank you so much for your time any help would be great!
