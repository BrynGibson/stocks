1,How To Detect A Fraud,dhk6q0,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dhk6q0/how_to_detect_a_fraud/,18,17,"With the growing number of pumps / scams posted on our subreddit, lets discuss how to detect a fraud, and what to look out for. First, let's start with what's not a fraud. 

* The Dummy Trader:

This guy shows himself as having little to no knowledge in the market. He likely admits it, and presents his arguments for his stock pick. This isn't fraud by any stretch, but the longevity of this trader is likely minimal at best.

* Questions about a stock

No promoter asks questions, they tell. They will tell you all you need to know why their pick is the greatest. Questions are a good sign of honesty. For example: if someone posts ""Is xyz a good stock pick?"" chances are they're non-frauds.


Here's an example of a fraud:
-

* The promoter:

We will call this guy ""Captain Pee."" Mr.Pee will tell you about his stock picks, how great they are, how the trolls are wrong, how he makes excellent picks for YOU. It's all for you! What could be wrong with that!? They tell you their cheap pennystock picks. Shamelessly telling you why their picks are better, and how you need to present picks in order to compete. Mr.Pee is a fraud. He's trying to drive interest, no matter how small, to sell his shares into. 

* The Hidden Chatroom Scammer

We will call him Michael Ball. Michael ball and his brand new service ""market notifying"" will give you valuable information! He's going to give you everything for free! Free chatroom, free information, free starter kit; all fantastic right? He will show you his P/L to prove he's legit, and deserves the customer(s) he's gotten in his chatroom. What he doesn't tell you is his P/L is fabricated using websites that aren't affiliated with the broker. These chatrooms likely operate in one of two factions: They are meant to give you minimal information, while telling you they're providing content you deserve! You do deserve it, because if you're a sucker, you deserve to lose. The second way they operate is a more fictitious one, they simply take your money. There stock picks don't matter because they wont be traded regardless. The proof is fabricated / flat-out faked. They simply make money from selling the service using the disclaimer of ""entertainment purposes.""",2019-10-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dhk6q0/how_to_detect_a_fraud/

I have done some research and have been unable to find out exactly what the ""expert market "" is.
