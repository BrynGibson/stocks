2,WRR.V and Junior Mining,ekyn5b,Julmat1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ekyn5b/wrrv_and_junior_mining/,1,0,"Is anybody looking into junior gold mining companies? With gold prices at all time highs and pushing upwards, usually money starts to move in gold mining junior companies. I wanna take advantage of this trend. 

I like WRR.V, a gold exploration play located in Nevada, but the stock is on the canadian exchange. Last year around this time they released drilling results and stock went up 350%. Since then it hasnt done much but more drilling results are expected to come in soon so I bought in. 

Is anybody playing gold mining juniors? Any stock recommendations? I feel like theres money to be made there with current market and geopolitical conditions but not many people are talking about it.

It has been flat for [the last 20 months](https://i.imgur.com/PVZ7e51.png). Its a high risk play as this company is jumping into Libya. The project is to provide a Prepaid closed-loop card solution  to a regional Libyan bank to serve around 20,000 clients at almost 100 POS locations. [News Release here](https://ceo.ca/@nasdaq/fintech-select-provides-corporate-update-f9f91).  This company is horrible with investor communication and leaves you hanging for months at a time. With that I still think I can catch it pop in the near future if the project is successful.
