0,Pump and dumps: A comparison between stocks and cryptocurrencies - BlockHaven,945mwf,Ovitius,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/945mwf/pump_and_dumps_a_comparison_between_stocks_and/,20,7,"We   recently published an article about how pump and dumps function with stocks and with cryptocurrencies. The goal of this article is to help both stock and cryptocurrency investors better understand what they are up against in this emerging and unpredictable market. We outlined the process behind a stock pump and dump, and the many ways a pump and dump can occur with cryptocurrencies. We also took the time to explain why criminals, stock promoters and other hostile actors are now favoring cryptocurrencies  for  price manipulation schemes.

Feel free to discuss and give us your feedback ! Cheers.
