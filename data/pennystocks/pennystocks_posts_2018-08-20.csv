6,Watchlist,98tm4g,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/98tm4g/watchlist/,11,0,"This month has been horrible in terms of finding volatile penny stocks. I've made 3 total trades the entire month! Nothing looks appealing. Remember my short position in AMPE? I said the stock wasn't going anywhere but I knew it was going to but I decided to close my position in case the volatility when higher. Well shortly after I closed my short position the stock dropped over 60%! I would have made thousands and thousands if I had held my position a little while longer. Instead I get a 1 1/2% gain.  


Some volatile stocks that will experience momentum:

ZOES - Ignore this gain, most likely an M&amp;A transaction. Stock isn't going anywhere.

  
IZEA - A good short under $1.50. I missed this one, but expect it to go down further.  


YRD - On a daily chart you can see consolidation as MMs accumulate shares and the stock rises following the consolidation stage. Not sure this will continue to persist.  


CNET - This stock is approaching a previous high, but I don't expect it to surpass the previous level of resistance, so I would see this falling further in the near future.

JACKSONVILLE, FL, Aug. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mCig, Inc. (OTCQB: MCIG), a diversified company servicing the legal cannabis markets, announced today that it will begin harvesting its first crop of organic hemp from NYAcres in two to three weeks time.

To oversee the harvest and curing process, MCIG brought on Chadd McKeen , co-author of *Idiots Guide: Growing Marijuana* and founding partner at Canna Mana Trading Company. With over 12 years of experience in cannabis cultivation, Mr. McKeen will be onsite to jump-start the post-grow process, from the actual mechanics of the harvest to extraction and buyer relationships.

The NYAcres project began in June 2018 as a joint project with FarmOn!Foundation. The 55,000 pound yield of hemp bio-mass will be a huge growth generator for MCIG, its recently launched [CBD Market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EhX-bbFbtt79TOFatIcApP07Tg-N0z9lLkJCwMZT9Anoup7hfNWJRG7YrsCuYLKl6a9Y7un9puo8qUwSuQa6VQ==) ([www.cbd.biz](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Xmd1qUxlI24fhs3FDhuBjQXUjlvFCaMXm-xanASZ6c4GUd-q6sSIn0acNnZ2LfzDWR5KaiRE0Na6NiIuYbCzhw==)), and new CBD pet line, [Artax](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vFhg7J_aHojAJk1pp7c3qAd66crcj0KO7xZFdpgdjyCd2MLzRm3siUe2Wj_P_RGa3i9AuQE8Unqqr8okn7FWgg==) ([**www.cbd.biz/portfolio/artax**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Xmd1qUxlI24fhs3FDhuBja8u95NSnWf-_BqGOdmabyMsWFuc3yugpjo4L-mZbsNP6ZzWg9eKn9qRyCIio893ed4rk2lJc-wmo8sHSypEGTvSsowi5kyApAnDyKoJvDVBnFWH5gFjRfMHjpW3zsMKf4ljcAmyHBx9abHrKKbqL3BR4zAIjKZrBnkhnVZmPHPUpbHy3VL3aFtHZ5hiyt30EjndqyXEJEIV_4iG0D-xxQaF-ZyU6KNywDMgkrsKddPkFKDvXCKqeW7RedHLFugI6WKMBSEKxMNWFTBCgN7Q-NI=)/). 

After harvested and dried, cannabidiol (CBD) will be extracted from the plant source material. The particular strains of hemp grown at NYAcres, Cherry Wine and Berry Blue sourced from the Colorado Hemp Project are known for their high concentrations of CBD. Once extracted, CBD distillate can be used as a component for a diverse range of end user products, from CBD capsules to CBD vape. Initial projections from our Advisory team and based upon their collective years of farm production and development; we expect revenues greater than $10 million annually from the 40-acre yield. With 212 total acres available, the NYAcres Project could potentially yield up to $50 million per year in high demand CBD retail products with this unique approach.

“MCIG will continue to seek strategic partnerships in hemp agriculture,” says Paul Rosenberg, MCIG CEO. “The success of this venture with NYAcres is just the beginning. As the public demand for CBD and other hemp products grows, so does the need for a consistent hemp supply. With true hemp legalization on the horizon in the US, MCIG is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of this soon-to-be billion dollar industry.”
