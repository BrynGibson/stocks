Also, saying that it is on news stations is misleading. All I have seen on the websites is the same PR article that Andi/Utopya released. There is little to no original content being published by news organizations. This was also largely orchestrated by the twitter followers who personally emailed many of the local stations.

After pumping the stock, fraudsters make huge profits by selling their cheap stock into the market.
Pump and dump schemes often occur on the Internet where it is common to see messages posted that urge readers to buy a stock quickly or to sell before the price goes down, or a telemarketer will call using the same sort of pitch. Often the promoters will claim to have ""inside"" information about an impending development or to use an ""infallible"" combination of economic and stock market data to pick stocks. In reality, they may be company insiders or paid promoters who stand to gain by selling their shares after the stock price is ""pumped"" up by the buying frenzy they create. Once these fraudsters ""dump"" their shares and stop hyping the stock, the price typically falls, and investors lose their money.

... are not investments - 99% of them will lose value over the long run and never accomplish most of their forward looking pumping statements they put in press releases or on their websites. Never believe the hype - always be skeptical of everything you hear.
The people mostly making money are promoters, front loading pumpers with big followings they can dump on, crooks, some of the flippers, and sometimes the very lucky.
Pumpers only tell you to buy stocks that they already own. Pumpers only tell you to hold stocks because they want to make sure you hold longer than them.
Very little respect or morals exist in stinky pinky land.

The Consequences of an SEC Suspension:
As of September 21, 2012 :
 From January 2010 until today there have been a total of 1116 SEC Suspensions where ALL 1116 stocks were reinstated on the Grey Sheets after the ten day SEC Suspension 

ended.
 Of the 1116 SEC Suspended stocks since January 2010 645 Registrations have been revoked.
 The remaining 471 stocks are on the Grey Sheets (or still in the ten day SEC Suspension within the last ten days) and not one has made it off the Grey Sheets back to quotation by any Market Maker.
 In case anyone asks what the chances are for their holy grail stock to get off the Grey Sheets.
 All 1116 Suspensions and 645 revocations are listed with direct links to the SEC actions:
