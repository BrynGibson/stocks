KULR’s proprietary carbon fiber thermal management solutions were developed in coordination with NASA and are lighter, more flexible, safer and more effective than other commercially available thermal products. KULR’s Thermal Runaway Shield ([TRS](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kulrtechnology.com%2Flithium-ion-battery-protection&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TRS&amp;index=4&amp;md5=a5baa2a1d00241c4d2f9759dcaafd7e5)) has been shown in NASA testing to stop thermal runaway propagation which can cause fires and explosions in lithium-ion battery packs. In addition to its battery applications, KULR’s products and designs have broad and diverse applications in a range of growing industries, including electric vehicles.

BYD is among the largest rechargeable battery makers in the world and the largest in China. Its largest equity holder is Berkshire Hathaway. A BYD subsidiary, BYD Auto, makes automobiles, buses, forklifts and trucks and, in 2016, was the world's top selling plug-in electric car manufacturer with more than 100,000 units delivered. BYD Auto has a joint venture with Daimler AG to build electric cars and recently [announced plans](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-06-27%2Fbyd-builds-massive-car-battery-plant-to-boost-capacity-fourfold&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced+plans&amp;index=5&amp;md5=5c954b360ac48768ceb71810b1d9cf48) to build the largest battery production facility in the world.

“Mr. Xia had been an early investor of KULR,” said KULR co-founder and CEO, Michael Mo. “Our company and technology will greatly benefit by his wealth of knowledge, experience, and relationships in the electronics and battery industry in China, as he becomes more actively involved with us.”

In addition to his leadership position with BYD, Xia founded Zhengxuan Capital in 2004, an investment firm with over 10 billion RMD ($1.5 billion USD) in assets under management. He was named to the 2018 Forbes China Rich List, with an estimated net worth $1.1 billion USD. Among more than 30 investments under Zhengxuan Capital, Xia is a Director and early investor in robotics company [UBTech](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fubtrobot.com&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=UBTech&amp;index=6&amp;md5=74c8ddb10102c96c70bb1a88cd9238bb), which is the world’s most valuable consumer robotics company at $5 billion valuation.

“I have always believed in KULR’s technology to solve challenging thermal problems,” said Xia. “What KULR is doing with batteries, vehicles, and other markets is really important and I look forward to contributing to their growth.”

KULR recently executed an [exclusive agreement](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20180326005764%2Fen%2FKULR-Technology-Exclusively-Commercialize-Lithium-Ion-Battery-Safety&amp;esheet=51835174&amp;newsitemid=20180711005613&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=exclusive+agreement&amp;index=7&amp;md5=55812ad34a7d8dd66319ecd3e611e277) with NASA and the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to commercialize the internal short circuit device (ISC). The ISC, creates predictable lithium-ion cell failures in lab conditions where those failures can be studied and safety technology can be developed and tested. ISC failure testing is the NASA standard for battery safety for crewed space flight.

(GTBP) Announces Agreement with a Major Pharmaceutical Company to Study its Drug Candidate OXS-1550 in Combination With a Multi-Billion Dollar Oncology Drug,905pra,jameson62,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/905pra/gt_biopharma_inc_gtbp_announces_agreement_with_a/,1,5,"Following this company for awhile now. I'm VERY curious to see which company they're going to be doing this with...""Major Pharmaceutical Company""

GT Biopharma Inc. (GTBP) and (Euronext Paris: GTBP.PA) announced today a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) between a Major Pharmaceutical Company and Dr. Daniel Vallera, Director, Section of Molecular Cancer Therapeutics at the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota.

Under the terms of the agreement, this Major Pharmaceutical Company will supply a formulation of their multibillion dollar, widely prescribed oncology drug, which has been approved for use in several hematologic malignancies to Dr. Vallera to be used in this study.

Dr. Vallera is the lead researcher for GT Biopharma’s bispecific antibody drug conjugate (ADC) program, and the innovator of oncology drug candidate DT2219, also known as OXS-1550. OXS-1550 targets two antigens on cancer cells and contains a cytotoxic payload thereby increasing the probability it will kill the cancer cells. OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor and/or CD22 receptors which includes B-cell leukemias and lymphomas and has a modified form of diphtheria toxin (DT390) as its cytotoxic drug payload. After OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, it is taken in by the cancer cells and subsequently deploy its cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload which inhibits protein synthesis and kills the cancer cells.

Initial pre-clinical work performed by Dr. Vallera suggests a much greater effect when OXS-1550 is given in combination with this established oncology drug. Dr. Vallera said: “I am looking forward to conducting these experiments. Early work suggests that these two agents would be a great combination in the treatment of certain cancers. This initial work will assist us in deciding what tumors to target and the doses to employ.”

GT Biopharma’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Raymond Urbanski said: “This is a tremendous step forward for the OXS-1550 program. Pre-clinical data suggests that the combination of OXS-1550 and this agent is highly potent against certain tumor cell lines. This MTA will allow further studies in animal models to both confirm the effects as well as ascertain which tumor types are the most susceptible to this potent combination.”
