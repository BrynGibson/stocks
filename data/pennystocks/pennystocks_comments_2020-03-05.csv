Everyone here taking the ibio pump hype seriously is hilarious to me. These bio stocks have been going up because of the CV panic and people are making guesses as to which one will be the next one to get pumped. If you haven't already invested at this point you are taking a major gamble trying to get on the ride now. That doesn't mean you can't make  money. But it does mean the chance of you holding the bag once these CV stocks crash down again is quite high. Only gamble money you are okay losing.",2020-03-05

Only explanation I have for today's decline is that there are other companies working on test kit developments and for whatever reason - likely crooked fiscal crap- CODX is having trouble getting emergency approval by FDA to distribute.  Even though they are testing in other countries successfully. 

The CDC decided to develop a diagnostic test when there was already a working test kit developed by the WHO,  Ours was botched.  Now there is a major shortage and now for whatever reason ($$) we are waiting for some ""commercial"" companies to distribute the tests.  

I'm still holding- however there are now many other players on the field.  Quest, LabCorp, Opko,
