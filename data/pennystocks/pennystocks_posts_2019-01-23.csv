The dealership generated revenue of $35 million in 2018, with profits that are within range for healthy auto dealers of that size. Its ownership owns multiple stores, all of which are in discussion for possible acquisition.  


Innovest first announced it was exploring the retail auto industry on October 2, 2017, with the news that it was pursuing a group of five Midwest franchise stores generating $150 million in annual sales, and that a commitment letter had been obtained for funding such an acquisition ([**click her for that news**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aYjZrgykihVzboYKhQN7dhzyDMCrN_OkKDbo0V72D75G8U7Y9iTxiB2a7OlHiLxX6u1aQB8fwfX5UDKckL1I-bJIlhzaTuQum79tzllUyGOu98uo1JMQ0JB0oE7N7cimXZglJZi_CVx-gjctRX5SSfJ2G23HHRJauuu9LZEvTJ4=)).
