KULR Technology Group Announces Third Quarter 2018 Earnings (announcement made after market close on 11/13/18)

CAMPBELL, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 13, 2018--KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG), (the “Company” or “KULR”), today issued its third quarter 2018 financial statements which are included in its Form 10-Q and its Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mo, provided the following statement:

To our shareholders:

KULR Technology passed a few milestones in the third quarter of 2018:

Financial Milestones:

For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, KULR generated $482,798 and $15,106 of revenues, an increase of $467,692. Our revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2018 consisted of sales of our component product, our Carbon Fiber Velvet (“CFV”) thermal management solution.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we generated $881,929 and $26,006 of revenues, an increase of $855,923. Our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 consisted of sales of our component product, our CFV thermal management solution, sales of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) product as well as certain research and development contract services.

Generally, we earn greater margins on revenue from products compared to revenue from services, so product mix plays an important part in our reported average margins for any period. Also, we are introducing new products at an early stage in our development cycle and the margins earned can vary significantly between period, customers and products due to the learning process, customer negotiating strengths, and product mix.

Customer Progress:

Continued focus on defense and aerospace sectors led to 182% increase in revenue in the 3 rd quarter of 2018 as compared to the 2 nd quarter of 2018; Deepened relationships with world-class OEM developmental partners in the EV and scooter markets; Secured design wins working with world class research laboratories such as Air Force Research Lab, the Naval Research Lab, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; and Continued customer engagement with a US government agency.

Fourth Quarter 2018

Since becoming a publicly traded company in July of this year, we’ve been keenly focused on developing and commercializing our disruptive carbon-fiber based high-performance thermal management technologies across a wide array of electronics applications. Our revenue for the third quarter of 2018 increased 182% as compared to the 2 nd quarter of 2018, showing early signs of the momentum in our business and our growth potential. In the quarters ahead, we plan to forge additional global OEM ventures as well as deepen our partnerships within the aerospace and defense sectors. We anticipate our top line growth continuing for the next several quarters as our diversified product lines gain further adoption in primarily the aerospace, defense, and electric vehicle markets.

KULR’s core vision is commercializing its space qualified technology for the E-mobility revolution. E-mobility is one of the biggest market opportunities in the technology industry. It’s a grand convergence of electric vehicle technology, autonomous driving, AI/Cloud computing, and 5G communication and battery safety combined to fundamentally change the way we will live and work. Safety and energy efficiency are fundamentally important building blocks to the future of E-mobility. KULR will continue to develop new technologies, partner with the likes of NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and integrate with other innovators to be one of the leaders in this marketplace. KULR’s mission is to be a world leader in the E-mobility charging infrastructure network.

The foregoing information and summary of results of operation does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2018, which was filed on November 13, 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

**InnerScope's ""Grand Opening"" of its Roseville, California audiological hearing aid retail clinic is the first of 22 new audiological hearing aid retail clinics planned within Northern California in the next 6 to 12 months as part of InnerScope's aggressive new retail location expansion plan.**  


ROSEVILLE, Calif., Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc.

The opening of the brand-new retail clinic is part of InnerScope's overall aggressive expansion rollout plan of opening 22 new retail clinics within Northern California over the next 6 to 12 months (""Rollout Plan""). The Rollout Plan consists of finding the right location and staffing with experienced and licensed Hearing Healthcare Professionals (""HCPs"") to operate each of the 22 retail clinic locations. InnerScope's Rollout Plan takes advantage of its founders' extensive thirty plus years of in-depth knowledge and experience in the Northern California hearing aid market. The founders of InnerScope generated over $16 million in annual hearing aid sales from the 20 retail clinics they opened and sold in 2016. Additionally, InnerScope has plans to quickly staff retail clinics by tapping into the pool of experienced HCPs looking for a reputable hearing aid company with vast industry experience.

Based on the founders' previous owned retail clinics in the Northern California market, each new retail clinic is expected to generate an average of $500,000 to $1 million in its first year annual hearing aid sales revenue in with a growth factor of at least 5% every year after. However, some retail clinics are expected to generate $1.5 to $2 million in annual hearing aid sales revenue in its first year based on its location, senior demographics and the reported number of hearing aid sales currently generated from the competition in the market area.

InnerScope's cost for opening a single retail clinic is a total of $75,000 all in, including all hard and soft costs. InnerScope believes it can cash flow each location within six weeks and they can recoup the $75,000 opening investment within 6 months from the ""Grand Opening"" date. The Rollout Plan is based on opening two or more new Retail Clinics every month starting in November 2018. The Roseville, California location was the first new retail clinic opened under the Rollout Plan which took 19 days from signing the lease for the location until its ""Grand Opening"". So far, approximately $70,000 in gross revenue has been generated from only 5 days of Grand Openings from InnerScope's Roseville and Walnut Creek Retail Clinics. Plans for four more ""Grand Openings"" of new locations are expected by year end of 2018. Two new locations openings will be in the Sacramento Area and two new locations will be in East San Francisco Bay Area (""East Bay"") for a total of eight retail clinic locations (including acquisitions) by end of 2018.

Considering the Founders' in-depth knowledge and past experiences in successfully opening new retail clinics and the ability to cash flow each retail clinic within six weeks, InnerScope expects to have a total of 25 retail clinics including its Rollout Plan and retail clinic acquisitions by the end of 2019. These 25 retail clinics are expected to generate more than $12.5 million (based on $500,000 per location) in annualized gross revenue by year end of 2019 with a 20% to 30% EBITA.

**Business Update**

***""InnerScope, and its team of very skilled professionals, are extremely proud of what's been accomplished to date and look to continue to deliver on its mission, whereby increasing shareholder value for the more than 1400 shareholders and stakeholders,""*** *stated Matthew Moore, CEO InnerScope Hearing Technologies.* 

**InnerScope's Retail Clinic Acquisitions**

InnerScope announced earlier an LOI to acquire 100% of Value Hearing LLC and its two Northern California hearing aid retail locations. To complete this acquisition, Value Hearing LLC is in the process of a required audit of its financial records before InnerScope can complete the acquisition. InnerScope believes the acquisition should be completed in December 2018.

InnerScope previously announced in September 2018 that it has successfully acquired Kathy L. Amos audiology practice in Walnut Creek, California and has changed its dba to [Value Audiology &amp; Hearing Aid Center](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hTqc-y6Kpjsm8IWDaLmnI0w7UIA5MynetIe7ZmZwFssG5w7IvSJkqZBfR46r9eiX52MkXu5_e1DCDAITylITf88YH4x2yiiYIBzHLN68zvaNRNXevDVBzh55UYdu6UHw) (""VAHAC""). This acquisition, with the Rollout Plan, gives InnerScope not only the ability to create a market presence in the East San Francisco Bay Area, but also gives InnerScope the ability to increase its market share within the East Bay by opening more retail clinics. In addition, Dr. Kathy L. Amos, Doctor of Audiology and InnerScope's Director of Audiology, has been certified by and partnered with [TriWest Healthcare Alliance](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0FOkEJBB6ZL-rROmUNSHholXwhA4YYRJNzjVM-hOBNMXN4VT56vk96iWEmQYaJEdIuhFvmK8WcSRN3RtN53bC6V2wUuhTlzW9y9CpjUIzDwn8PdAKv60__0zA62bO0GykSIPmdNVFvzuhUxoxFrUEnMgpfCJVnT-2dgXoaGTuLI=) as a provider to treat and proudly care for Veterans at VAHAC under the Department of Veterans Affairs (""VA"") the Patient-Centered Community Care (""PC3"") and Veterans Choice Programs (""VCP""). The PC3 and VCP allow Veterans to receive high quality care, closer to home or on a more timely basis from local private sector doctors. Dr. Amos as a PC3 and VCP provider will be able to process VA billing claims for treating and fitting Veterans with hearing aids.

**InnerScope and** [Zounds Hearing Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RGBuesAidYjJlXihkQ168ZKlfEb58XsRmrq-qeTpOyMEWVQU30Rq7WzWNFsZhVrvuAeLaoU5YqeV0Sdr9OG6dOSH15UxrFwQYaCmjuG9hOM=)**. Agreement**

As previously announced on October 3, 2018, InnerScope entered into a Manufacturing Design and Marketing Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with [Zounds Hearing Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RGBuesAidYjJlXihkQ168UzI-ThHa_vxwGHQ-Ev-KO6Q8pa4M7UpWVEJldsw5oUtqm-AXFkxwA3vUvgQL8gQ0w9Bvd9Gr7oPHQgrFaeoM5k=). (""Zounds"") whereby Zounds was to provide design and technology services to InnerScope to enable the manufacture of hearing aids sold under the InnerScope's brand names, the terms of which was also previously disclosed. Effective as of November 2, 2018, the InnerScope and Zounds entered into a First Amendment to the Zounds Agreement calling for a payment of $1,000,000 to Zounds for the Technology Access Fee, which fee is to be paid in eight (8) installments of $75,000 each, in four-week intervals until $600,000 is paid, and $400,000 to be paid as Product Surcharges based on $200 per unit manufactured for up to the first 2,000 units. Once $400,000 of Product Surcharges are paid, said per unit surcharge will be discontinued.

The Agreement also gives InnerScope the ability to market and sell the complete Zounds branded hearing aid product portfolio. This will allow InnerScope to immediately leverage Zounds current hearing aid inventory for InnerScope's immediate inventory stock and ramp-up needs to facilitate the current orders and the Rollout Plan of retail clinics and other distribution channels.

""InnerScope has worked diligently to secure contracts and build a solid scalable business model and infrastructure,"" said Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies. ""InnerScope has grown and accomplished so much in just a very short time. We have hired key personnel to fill vital roles within the Company to ensure efficient execution of all contracts and agreements. InnerScope has grown to become much more than just a marketer and distributor of hearing aids. With the Zounds Hearing Inc. manufacturing agreement, InnerScope is able to manufacture its own high-quality hearing aids. As a manufacturer, it can directly compete with all of the six major global hearing aid manufactures (the ""Big Six"") in this $4 to $5 billion U.S. hearing aid market. InnerScope, as a manufacturer, also plans to distribute hearing aids to the B2B audiological practices as well as become an industry consolidator by vertically integrating with its corporate owned hearing aid retail stores. Combined with the InnerScope's vendor agreement with Walmart.com, and other potential vendor agreements with major big box retailers and major pharmacies chains, InnerScope is positioned to dominate the entire Direct-to-Consumer (""DTC"") hearing aid market space,"" Mr. Moore continued.

""Currently, approximately 95% of all hearing aids bought each year (approximately 2 million people) are sold and fit by HCPs at retail clinics. We believe the 48 million people in the U.S. that has reported to have hearing loss and may benefit using hearing aids, but choose not to buy because of high cost and inconvenience of going to a retail clinic, will now start buy hearing aids online as a less expensive option. InnerScope is changing the way hearing aids are bought, sold and dispensed beginning with its agreement with Walmart.com and plans to work with other major online retailers. InnerScope anticipates that online hearing aid revenue in the next five years will exceed the $4 to $5 billion revenue currently generated by the retail clinics. We also believe that once people start realizing they have the option to save money by having easy and convenient access to purchasing aids online without sacrificing any of their hearing quality experience and/or hearing services needed, the online hearing aids sales will continue to grow year after year. We expect as the total hearing aid market increases so will the number of HCPs and the number of retail clinics in the U.S. InnerScope, with its Rollout Plan, is primed to capture both online and the retail clinic distribution channels as the hearing aid market continues to grow,"" Mr. Moore concluded.",2018-11-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9x2cel/innd_innerscope_hearing_technologies_inc_opens/

SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Nu-Med Plus, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hB1DprUY5kfAlIYG35CrTfxYegLXiEM8FyJyf2h8qCI03am1_GwsbvSVPqoqIQartKZjIoX0O2sqOZBQ0YbqQw==). (OTCQB: NUMD), a medical device leader developing new nitric oxide delivery technology, announces a patent application on the new device which is designed to pretreat stored blood products with nitric oxide prior to patient transfusions.

Nitric oxide is naturally occurring in blood and acts as a vasodilator by expanding and dilating blood vessels. According to recent studies1, the longer blood is stored, the more nitric oxide is depleted, increasing potential risks to patients such as hypoxia, infection, and heart failure. The same studies2 suggest pretreating stored blood products with nitric oxide prior to a transfusion increases the ability of donor blood to carry and transfer oxygen when transfused into a patient.

Nu-Med Plus’ patent describes the new technology as a simple nitric oxide infusion device that can be used during or post blood collection. More than four million Americans receive blood transfusions every year; of those, more than 300,000 patients in the United States receive one or more blood units that have been stored for more than 30 days. The Federal Drug Administration current does not allow blood stored for more than 42 days to be used in transfusions.

“A blood transfusion is one of the most common medical procedures in the world and we believe this new Nu-Med Plus nitric oxide delivery technology will decrease the risks and increase the life-saving potential of blood transfusions,” said Jeff Robins, CEO of Nu-Med Plus. “This new application of the Nu-Med Plus’ technology also offers the potential to extend storage of blood beyond its current time limits.”

With this new device, Nu-Med Plus will now seek enrollment in further studies to investigate its efficacy. Nu-Med Plus is currently in the process of FDA approval for three additional nitric oxide delivery units including a fixed hospital unit, clinical unit, and a portable unit. Nu-Med Plus’ technology is designed to be utilized for a variety of inhaled nitric oxide treatments. Inhaled nitric oxide has already been proven to stabilize blood pressure, open airways, fight infections and blood clots, combat aging and treat erectile dysfunction.
