I am sure every trader/investor from their own mistakes and will uniquely develop their own way of trading. Nevertheless, I would love to learn from you. 

1. Where do you find penny stocks and how do you pick them for your portfolio?
2. What technical indicators do you look for, if any?
3. By the time I learn about a penny stock that has any interest, the pricing has already gone far too up to make it worth the risk. Is timing important? If yes, what is your strategy?
4. How do you discipline your trading and control your emotions?
