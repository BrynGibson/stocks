Also earlier this year it hit highs of 20-30 cents so I can wait for that kind of profit... in at .025 but concerned if it drops below .02 other day seemed to be MM punching folks out with stop losses. If they get snobar into social events it'll get the ball much larger then that exposure may propel it forward aswell (JUST MY OPINION ) glad I got some responses take care folks and stay green peeps!

I have been looking at penny stocks fir a while and while i do understand the whole risk behind them i just dont understand how pump and dumps work.
So the theory is rather simple right. You buy a cheap stock. And you buy alot of it and once other people bought it and the price went up you sell for a profit. Now lets say I have my new little tech company called X. X has 10000 shares at 0.00001 cent. Investment Banker A comes in and buys 8000 shares at the for mentioned price. The other 2000shares are sold to random privat ppl. So A has now pumped up the price to 1$ (wont be so much but easier to grasp for now). If he does try to dump it would he not need to find a buyer? Willing to take all 8000 shares at the same time? He wants to dump is stock all at once... How do they manage? 

Anybody able to clear the dump part for me?

Thanks in advance for your answers :)",2018-07-06
