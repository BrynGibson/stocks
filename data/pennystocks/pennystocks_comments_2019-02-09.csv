Meanwhile, I came across Ricky Guitierrez and Madazzfootballer (check spelling) on YouTube. I joined Ricky’s group with live vids everyday for like $200. Madazz has his own now. Most of this wasn’t for penny stocks but just how to find stocks and translated that to pennies. I used to do my own morning search from what I learned on YouTube vids and then I’d follow along the live vids or twitters to see if I found the same gappers that they did. I would never see what they were watching first, because I wanted to make sure that I could do it on my own. If they posted a ticker that I didn’t have on mine.

“Unfortunately, the company is not where it needs to be financially in order to proceed with further studies, ramp up new vet clinics, and eventually proceed to human trials. As many shareholders know, our financial troubles were due to the legacy toxic debt created before Dr. Korenko became CEO. Since last autumn, we worked tirelessly to negotiate our way out of this debt and obtain enough equity financing to get out from under the mercy of the debt holders. That we were able to accomplish this goal is a tribute to the skill and hard work of our officers, especially our CEO, Dr. Mike Korenko and our Corporate Advisor, George Sharp.

Unfortunately, the conversion of our debt to equity has made our current share structure untenable. Currently there are funders looking to help raise the $5 million required for our continued progress through equity financing. However, these funders are concerned about the current share structure. There is still much stock for sale from our converted toxic debt, even though the rate of selling is controlled by agreement. Vivos has always resisted executing a reverse split, as it has no desire to dilute or wipe out the retail shareholders or recent equity financiers. “

89,suprchgnt,eiw906n,/r/pennystocks/comments/aov0xn/honest_review_of_a_boiler_room_trading_course/eiw906n/,1," I went thru the courses offered by BRT some months back. Its not the best I've seen, nor is it the worst. The content is fairly well organized, but I remember thinking it seemed ""thrown together"" as if to cash in on the success of a couple of the more well known youtubers (Cameron, Sykes) that also offer courses. The plus is that its cheap and includes free access to the chat room. My only real complaint is that Connor sometimes didn't bother to show up to the chat room and the pre-market watch-list more often than not was never sent out.  I'm not trying to toss the guy under the bus, he's a great trader, but I don't think he's all that into creating a real education experience.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I actually started my journey with Warrior Trading early summer 2018 and enjoyed the content and classes. The structure of the course is similar to the formal higher edu courses I've taken over the years. They offer weekly breakout sessions to help new traders with question and cover different topic's in depth. A pretty nice trading sim-  riddled with bugs when I was an active member. Its crazy expensive but,it's clear the money spent is going into providing a better learning experience for students.  Would I pay for it again? If scalp trading  penny stocks were my thing than I'd say yes. No doubt Ross's strategy works when applied correctly.  If not, I 'd use the 4k to pay the market for my education and a therapist to help me learn how to cope with losses, fear, greed etc. Because its how you  control your emotions that separate the folks that go on tilt within 30 days  and those who are consistently profitable over the long run. Trading is 95% head space and 5% technical knowledge.

My advise would be to check out the free content on youtube first.  Rayner Teo has a ton of free and well presented content as do thechartguys, BRT and Warrior. Options Alpha offers their entire course for free. 

TradingView.com offers a solid charting platform for free (market delay) so you can practice charting for free. Real time requires a subscription. 

 ""Trading In The Zone"" is a horribly dry read, but its 100% worth the effort.  **I wish I would of started here.**

Don't hop from strategy to strategy. Learn a single strategy and master it. 

Save up or set aside money that you can lose to the market- your education.

Hope his helps- cheers
