Impossible to know, and by the time you know, it's overbought. If they become a mining operation, it'll be a good long-term hold, but right now it just looks/seems trade able.

16.98&amp;#37; up right now, may be as high as it goes, who knows? Do you know what happened in August last year that got them to $0.60? May be worth checking the SEDAR on the company. These guys often disclose when they're doing promos (they have to) so if you can correlate a promo to that previous PND-looking jump in value, then I'd either a) tread carefully on the basis it's going to pop or b) try your best to time it properly based on the august pop to ride it up &amp; get out before it goes back down. 

Get on the phone, call the company, ask them wtfs going on. They're happy to take those calls.",2018-07-05

That may just mean that this time of year is promo time for them based on 2-years of history of big rallies in July-August. I'll look into their SEDAR a bit more and see if it identifies as a promo. If so, I'd say get in ASAP and get out once you're up another 10-20&amp;#37; ",2018-07-05
