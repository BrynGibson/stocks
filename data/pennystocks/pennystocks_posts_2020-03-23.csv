I had to go back and look, but I have been a member of OTCM since 2018. The majority of the questions were about if I thought it was worth it and what you get. The simple answer to it is that it is 100% worth it. 

I will put it this way. On my trade with $ABMC alone, my profits would cover 128 more months of otcmethod. That doesn't mean you are making that on every trade, but I know for myself I have easily covered the monthly fee and more and that is not including the knowledge and everything else you gain from the mentorship.

I feel like the website doesn't really do it justice as to how much work is actually put into this mentorship program. 

What you get:

* The essential videos to get you started 
* A video every weeknight recapping all the trades of the day and making watchlists
* A private discord for all members
   * Recap channel that alerts potential trades or if a stock is a bag
   * The owner/mentor, Pat, is always available for questions and to help
* The videos also have an audio-only version so you can listen to it from anywhere
* Some Teaching Articles Written periodically
* Modified KST for trading on 5 min / 30 min charts

There is plenty I am probably missing. But for anyone that is asking and was interested, there it is. I don't know if it will be for you, but I know for myself I couldn't have asked for a better program and the community is really the best.

35,The pretty penny of XSPA,fnsm38,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fnsm38/the_pretty_penny_of_xspa/,1,60,"Hey, there gang. How's everyone? I hope everyone is crushing it and seeing the pattern for the supply/demand of pharm/bio stocks. We all know the deal here. There is a distinction between hype, profitable news, legitimate press release, earnings report, and procedure moving forward. I also want to include despite the differences between the good &amp; bad, anything can happen. Do charts still play a role? Absolutely. Can they still go in a bad direction? Of course. It all depends on what company ticker is a source and a necessity that could contribute to fighting against the Chinese Virus. 

Bellow, I introduce you to a potential diamond in the rough candidate: 

XSPA. 

Yes, I know what you're thinking. One, it's dirt cheap, two, it has a terrible recent EPS. While despite it has an awful EPS report, it still has other things we can appreciate great potential equivalent to the infamous BIOC that exploded recently (which in my BIOC is still a good candidate for all this bio/pharm demand).

&amp;#x200B;

Charting wise: It's a downtrend... however. 0.05 touch intrigued me, in a good way. You know me by now, I am fascinated by outside bar candles. Not only that, but it's also the lowest dip and maintained a well established HODL above the 0.10. For it to run into a bullish run or supernova intraday runner, it needs to break 0.18 &amp; higher, and further confirmation at 0.22. 

[XSPA chart](https://ibb.co/zVP9tgc)

Alrighty, the pros and cons.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

Marked as a buy/hold from various analysts.

Potential gap target: 0.80+

Support line: 0.10

PE: -0.02 (not bad)

PB: 1.00

Reasonable asset.

Theory wise, if they can manage to be a reasonable need or asset towards the company based on their recent announcement of using their airports as a testing center instead, this could turn around the company and potentially receive a debt waiver.

Price target reasonably at 1.24

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

Awful debt issue though not completely terrible. (ranked 24/39)

Recent public offering (though at least now that's out of the way, they could grow now that all the shorts squeezed out, moving forward).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall opinion, I'd say load when it dips at its peak since I see some high ticket bid orders at 0.10-0.11. XpresSpa seeks to support COVID-19 testing in 46 locations across 23 US Airports.

I am a final year student at Loughborough University ([www.lboro.ac.uk](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/)) doing an undergraduate dissertation on the subject of **Investor Psychology.**

I have spent the last week online trying to market my survey to investors across various online communities including Reddit and LinkedIn. Unfortunately, I seem to be having a really low *response rate*, as of the approximately 90 people who have clicked on my survey, only 3 have completed it :(

I have edited the survey to be as lean as possible, and take the least amount of time to complete as I could make it. It really is only 10 minutes.

If you have prior experience in finance &amp; investment, an educated interest, or so much as hold some shares in a company and have some time to spare, I would really appreciate if you could complete a brief survey consisting of two short questionnaires revolving around *situation-based investment decisions, Agree-vs-Disagree questions,* and an *investor profile* for reporting prior experience and knowledge across several investment categories. Perhaps you may find it interesting or learn something new!

IMPORTANT: All important information is detailed in Page 1 of the survey.

The survey is available at the following link: [**https://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/investor-psychology-and-financial-risk-tolerance**](https://lboro.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/investor-psychology-and-financial-risk-tolerance)

Company expects distribution would materially impact sales

**KINDERHOOK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2020 /** American Bio Medica Corporation (OTC PINK:ABMC), a manufacturer of accurate, cost-effective immunoassay test kits, announced today that it began offering on March 17, 2020, via a distribution partnership, a Rapid Test to detect Covid-19 in whole blood, serum or plasma. The assay offers qualitative and differential detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) and provides results in as few as 2 minutes and generally not more than 15 minutes. The test has not yet been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but is being offered under the March 16, 2020 guidance set forth by the FDA.

The test can be used for rapid screening of carriers of the virus that are symptomatic or asymptomatic and can be used across many markets including hospitals, clinics, and by employers and correctional institutions. The test is not available for consumer use and will be marketed in full compliance with the FDA guidance, including the required labeling indicating that antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude a Covid-19 infection.

To place an order, customers can call (800) 227-2343, or (518) 758-8158 outside the United States or, contact the company via email at [COVID19@abmc.com](mailto:COVID19@abmc.com).

I bought 1,450 opko stocks at 2.16 per share. Over the past 2 weeks this stock had a big increase and immediate drop back to 1.40. My plan was to sell at 3 and day trade through webull. Anything over 2.1 I am selling due to the high amount of short sellers, volatility, and bad CEO reputation. 

Even if I sell and it goes to 4 I consider that a win because with this stock it could easily bounce right back down. I'll be watching the market tmrw morning to get out and start day trading. Ill be watching the stock and if I see it break past 4 I can still earn a profit without holding the bag. I didn't come to gamble, I came to learn the penny stocks market. There were stocks that jumped and I knew I couldn't invest but didn't have the funds while in Opk.

Just now shot up to 60 out of the blue and is back down to 30-35 rang. I don‚Äôt know much about this company but WOW what a crazy day. definitely keep your eye on this for the coming days. I could see possibly huge profits if you can  play into the rapid fluctuations.,2020-03-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fnq7du/ebkdy/
