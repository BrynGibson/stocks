Water can be alkaline due to minerals in the earth which are naturally alkaline and at a high enough concentration may have positive health benefits.

I've seen the great importance of¬†natural herbs and the wonderful work they have done in people's lives.¬†I wonder why people still spend their money on surgery, injections and¬†drugs each time they are sick. Natural herbs can cure all kinds of¬†illness including herpes, diabetes, asthma, HIV, hepatitis, etc. I've¬†seen it with my own eyes. I was cured of hepatitis and my aunt and her¬†husband were cured of herpes by Dr. Iguma who uses natural herbs to¬†cure different kind of illness. Even Dr. Sebi prove to the whole world¬†that natural herbs can cure all diseases and he cured countless of¬†people using natural herbs. I know is hard to believe but am a living¬†testimony. There is no harm in trying herbs. He is also a spell¬†caster, he can cast a spell to restore your marriage back to normal, a¬†good luck spell to prosper in life and excel in whatever you do in¬†life.
