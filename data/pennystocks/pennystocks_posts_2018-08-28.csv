**Emotion Fashion Brands, Inc. lands a 4-year contract worth over $14 million dollars.**

Carson City, NV &amp; Hong Kong, Aug. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 12 ReTech Corporation (OTCQB: RETC) announced today that its Emotion Fashion Brands, Inc’s Lexi-Luu Dancewear is to be sold in Asia. A distribution contract was recently signed between Emotion Fashion Brands, Inc. and Global Outlets Group, Inc., a USA based distributor who successfully brings American manufactured products and brands to countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, China and Vietnam.

This contract will allow Global Outlets to sell Lexi-Luu branded merchandise in its distribution territories for four years. Global Outlets Group plans to sell $1 million of Lexi Luu Dancewear in the first year, the minimum annual merchandise purchase guaranteed is $500,000, with any unpurchased amount between $500,000 and $1 million being added to the second year’s minimum guarantee. The Contract specifies a higher minimum purchase guarantee each year with the fourth year’s minimum purchase guarantee set at $10,000,000.  

Lexi-Luu Dancewear is one of the micro brands that 12 ReTech acquired on May 1, 2018 as part of its Emotion Fashion Brands acquisition. Emotion Fashion now operates in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is ramping up its manufacturing operations to be able to meet domestic and international demand. Recently, Utah was ranked third by CNBC in their ‘America’s Top States for Business 2018’ scorecard which is part of the reason for the move from California.

Hub Blanchett, Emotion Apparel’s CEO commented, “I am very pleased that Lexi-Luu Dancewear will be available to parents in a larger part of the world. We have brightened the smiles of children in the USA for many years, and now the time to bring our dancewear to the rest of the world has arrived.”

Angelo Ponzetta, 12 ReTech’s CEO previously stated, “Lexi-Luu is a timeless brand of kid’s dancewear that is well recognized in the “dance world”. That our products are ‘Made in the USA’ has been well received by families with young children in our primary geographic market. Hub’s team has worked closely with us and because of that, we are now ready, ahead of schedule, to grow our sales and extend our brand awareness into worldwide consumer markets.”

Hub concluded, “Many demographics on foreign lands want to experience the American lifestyle. In the 70’s, for example, famous apparel brands such as Levi’s, Lee and Wrangler were sought out in the rest of the world and became iconic symbols of American culture. We think that American culture is resurging again and Emotion Fashions is ready to meet that need in the worldwide markets. The new contract was brought to us by the 12 ReTech team who operates internationally. Their reach is one of many reasons why we joined up with them. We never would have seen this opportunity without 12ReTech.”

Mr. Ponzetta concluded,” We are working hard on our 12 Technology Suite and expect to be able to announce additional strategic partnership(s) in the near future to bring value to our prospective retailers.

TULSA, OK, Aug. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- AppSwarm, Inc. (OTC PINK: SWRM), a technology company specializing in the accelerated development and publishing of mobile apps, announces the launch of its new scholastic crowdfunding platform called Booster Funder just in time for the ‘Back to School’ season.   


Increasingly teachers, school librarians, coaches and other educators who work directly with students have been turning to crowdfunding to raise money for supplies, special projects, and other items for their students. Booster Funder is focused on providing a platform specifically for the rapidly growing area of scholastic fundraising for school projects.   


Booster Funder can be used to raise funding for projects such as  


\- School Supplies  
\- Arts and Craft Events  
\- School Clubs  
\- Sports Team Uniforms and Equipment  
\- Dance and Performance Arts  
\- New Computers for Classroom  


In addition to these projects, Booster Funder could also be used to raise funds for student causes such as tuition and scholarship assistance for promising students looking to achieve their dreams.  


**Raise Funding Within Your Community**  


Crowdfunding takes away some of the inequities that exist when schools in more affluent areas are able to raise funds from parent organizations or community members to supplement the classroom, cover extracurricular activities, or provide additional enrichment.  


Fundraising campaigns can offer benefits for different level contributions, such as hats, t-shirts, or school banners based on the level of donations received to help build branding and community spirit around their campaign to their donors.  


Campaigns can also provide detailed info on their projects, along with photos and videos to assist them in raising the funds they seek for the project.   


**Future Enhancements**  


AppSwarm will work through rest of the school year to enhance features on the platform, build a sales and customer support team behind the project, and launch a companion mobile app that will assist users in promoting their funding campaigns to friends and family on both their phone, and social media messengers such as Facebook and Instagram.
