Eventually I decided to log in from my PC and saw that the sell had executed at a price of $1.96. I'm so confused.

Would you say that following the news release, whether through paid sites or news release section on OTCmarket would be a pretty good way to know about releases quickly?

This tells me even if I had bought a few hours after release (in the afternoon) I would still have gained 100+%, which is amazing given I‚Äôve lost tens of thousands chasing highs instead of getting up to date information quickly. 

I do think it‚Äôs slightly annoying how ABMC news was not in the news release section and only in the individual profile. I guess the news release section is not comprehensive, but I did see a few others that jumped significantly today in the news release section.

I think it has room to grow but it has crazy swings. Even with the news that they were FDA approved today, it didn't shoot past highs from close to a year ago when the world wasn't dealing with the worst medical crisis it's had in over a century.  

It most likely will grow but I think calls for it to skyrocket to $12+ are unjustified minus people acting like cheerleaders because they are vested themselves.  What this stock has taught me it to play swings.  

If it drops low enough (for me, that's currently someone in the 1.7-1.8 range), I'll personally buy more and then sell again on the next upswing.  I could be very wrong but my opinion is as good as the next person's on a random online message board.",2020-03-23

The Q4 2019 I would look into why it dropped, could be virus related due to lack of inventory or whatever. It's a double bottom, which is why I like it. Not so much an 'outside bar per sean' but I've seen double bottom touch before and they explode. Looking at the past, it hasn't touched 1.20 like that since 2019, so this is possibly a sign for a potential run opportunity. It has solid support where started and I don't personally see it dipping unless otherwise if it's affected by via news. opportunity. It appears someone has failed a few times dropping big orders, but the smart bidder noticed a HODL line and made the appropriate bid at 8:30am. Maybe he/she was testing to see if it would run, but there's a conflicting resistance at 1.35, though a very soft wall, maybe because there's low activity/volume.

I would positively say overall, it has plenty of room for potential since its slow, HODL, and afloat which is good.",2020-03-23

659,psychicnewton,flcg7nv,/r/pennystocks/comments/fnuial/is_it_to_late_to_jump_on_aytu/flcg7nv/,1,"I personally think AYTU has a lot of room to grow, especially when you look at the breaking of the $2 mark in after hours after being suppressed all day and the recent explosion of CODX. While 100k testing kits is great and all, I think the real value lies in the fact that the test only takes 2-10 minutes to result. I work in Emergency healthcare and the two biggest issues right now are lack of tests and the time it takes to receive results.  The lack of tests means that not everybody exhibiting symptoms get tested. Instead they have to qualify through algorithms (i.e. known exposure/recent travels/etc.) which means not enough people are being tested, especially in southern states. In regards to timing, patients go 5-7 days without knowing if they have Covid-19, which makes them a non-Covid case for nearly a week. For states that haven't implemented stricter quarantine measures this is a big issue (and we know  a ton of people simply aren't adhering to social distancing). I think in light of Trump's comments today about wanting to get businesses back to normal as quickly as possible, knowing which people actually have the virus in a 2-10 minutes span will be vital to ensure that we are quarantining the right population, rather than everybody. All this being said, I have not been trading stock for long and cannot speak to the business/trends/projections so please do your own research and come to your conclusions... but I know that an AYTU test would be a huge upgrade to the current situation for many healthcare systems and the fact that they can produce so many tests is a good sign.",2020-03-23

I know you think your the smartest guy here, yet your answer just shows how fucking dumb you really are. First of all, read my last sentence again. Since you probably have trouble actual reading, it says, ‚ÄúI just read about these guys tonight‚Äù so the only fanboy here is you sitting on your knees in front of me right now. I don‚Äôt give a shot about this company, I was adding to the intilrctisl conversation because that‚Äôs the purpose of these subs, not showing off how big a child you are. Because I respect my money enough, I buy blue chip stocks, not penny lottos. 

Just so you don‚Äôt go around spouting all this dumb shit you wrote again, let me learn you something little boy. This company actually sells a ‚Äúserological test‚Äù, much different than every other companies test you think your so smart about and listed as having the same kind of test. It‚Äôs a test that doesn‚Äôt need a lab and days wait to find out. The test doesn‚Äôt need refrigeration, gene splicing, special tools to determine results and much much more equipment and time for a simple fucking yes or no whether you have the zombie virus or not. It finds the antibodies in your blood sometimes in under 10 minutes for a blood swab. Imagine being a doc on the front lines dealing with hundreds of patients a day, yet can‚Äôt find out if each had the virus until 4 days later. Yea, that‚Äôs your other shit lab test companies, not this one, not even close to being the same. So these guys locked up N America, 3 huge countries with a test that produces an answer in under 10 min. IT WILL SAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS LIFES. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important, not because one or the other gets you your bitch boy tendies. Get a fucking clue, if you come at a man, at least know what the fuck your talking about so you don‚Äôt look like the shmuck you do , right now at this very moment.
