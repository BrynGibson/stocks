I was up 16k on ALPP recently and was greedy. In a matter of minutes after being up for a day or two it dropped fast ie. The dump. I managed to still pull a small profit but it looked like it was reversing so fearing I would miss another HUGE run I got back in only to be down a little. Funny thing is as I was reading I was like damn checking the boxes.,2020-01-23
