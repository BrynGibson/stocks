You. Are. Not. Better. Than. The. Market. 

Everyone thinks they are “pretty smart so they can do it”

Regardless of if you’re actually smart general intelligence will not make up for experience and emotional control you need to be successful at this.

I was naive too, I’m not judging you- I literally said the same words you just said and I lost 10 grand, all of my savings. Do I regret it, no. I regret not hammering into my head before I started that I need to know what I’m doing before I start. 

If you can trade with a realistic amount of fake money(start with 1000, because that’s more realistic to what you would start with real money with- not 100grand)successfully for 2 weeks without basing it on getting lucky, then you put real money in because at that point you’ve proven on some level you know a little bit about trading.

Let me tell you not to worry about missing out because I know you’re goin to say “I don’t want to miss out on the trades with real money for 2 weeks”.

Listen- there will ALWAYS be trades. You’re goal is to learn how to be at the right stock at the right time and to get in, and get out. Take the 40$ profit because I KNOW you wanna hold it until it reaches $100- “just a minute longer then I’m out” and that’s how you lose your money. It’s a marathon- take the small wins over hoping for big ones. Control yourself and you I’ll do fine- wish I knew these things when I started.

Also fuck trying to avoid Pattern Day Trader rule. If you can’t have the patience and control to put all your effor into 3 high quality trades per week, you won’t make it. If I had stuck to 3 trades per week, I would still have that money. Good luck and I will gladly do my best to answer your questions.",2018-04-14

35,Thieflord2,dxffznl,/r/pennystocks/comments/8c717o/how_am_i_supposed_to_make_money/dxffznl/,1,"Yeah I highly recommend starting with trading on paper and learning about the risks and what not.  So if you trade in an Individual Investment account, you must pay taxes in one of two ways on your GAINS.  


1)  Capital gains.   You hold a position for longer than a year, and then you sell for a profit.  This is taxed as CAPITAL GAINS TAX.


2)  Regular income.  You make a profit on a trade in a time period less than one year of holding.  This is taxed just like any other jobs income, and falls into your corresponding tax bracket.  I can help you learn more about that if you want to talk further on what that means, as for many individuals there are tax advantaged options that might benefit you.


I won't pretend I have been a trader all my life but my father has been a very successful trader for much of his life, and the wisest advice he ever gave me about investing and trading is this;   ""Never be in a position where you are NEED to make money on your investments or trades.  Trades just seem to do better when you don't need the money to survive.  They do even better when you don't need the money at all.""  Its all about the psychology of trading just as much as the mathematics and logic behind it.


Good luck and stay financially safe buddy.
