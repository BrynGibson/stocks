4,Esports Entertainment Group (GMBL:OTCQB),9bw2st,vinabate,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9bw2st/esports_entertainment_group_gmblotcqb/,12,16,"[GMBL Investor Deck](https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/RedChip/gmbl-investor-deck)

I am surprised that this company is not spoken of more regularly on this thread. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before esports explodes, likely to even be featured as a future Olympic medal. 

This industry is growing at an unprecedented rate, yet many investors have put them on the back burner. 

Recent news shows that GMBL have partnered with numerous investment bankers, namely Joseph Gunnar &amp; Co. which is most likely going to assist in up listing GMBL to the Nasdaq. 

After all, our goal on this thread is to beat the analysts on major news networks covering these small cap companies, no?

Their betting platform, vie.gg is unheard of in the esports community where players are able to bet against each other instead of the house (taking a small commission of 5-10%).

Has anyone heard news of this company or would like to share their thoughts/ideas on them and the sector as a whole?
