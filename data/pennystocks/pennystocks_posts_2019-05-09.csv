## Hy-Vee adds to growing list of retail customers throughout the Midwest

COSTA MESA, Calif., May 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, and the first publicly traded company in America whose primary focus is the production and sales of hemp-infused beer, announces Hy-Vee Supermarkets (‚ÄúHy-Vee‚Äù) are now carrying Major Hemp HIPA in select locations in Iowa, with plans to quickly expand to additional stores over the coming weeks.¬† ¬†  


Hy-Vee was founded in 1930 as a single general supply store during the Great Depression.¬† Despite its inauspicious beginnings, it has grown tremendously into a thriving supermarket chain encompassing 245 supermarkets throughout the states of Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin.¬†¬†¬† Hy-Vee currently has 85,000 employees and generates more than $10 billion in annual sales.¬† The largest Hy-Vee stores include full-service bakeries, delicatessens, pharmacies, dine-in food service, liquor and beer.¬† Many other stores maintain fuel states with convenience stores carrying beverages.¬†

Launched in November 2018, Major Hemp HIPA‚Äôs formulation includes hemp seed powder, which is essentially free of both THC and CBD.¬† In December 2018, immediately following the passage of the Agriculture Act of 2018, known commonly as the 2018 Farm Bill, which federally legalized hemp and hemp-derived CBD, the FDA certified hemp seed powder as Generally Regarded As Safe (‚ÄúGRAS‚Äù), formally legalizing its use in the food supply.¬† The FDA is currently evaluating the permission of hemp-derived CBD into food and beverages.¬†

President Ted Jorgensen of wholly-owned subsidiary, Major Hemp, stated, ‚ÄúI am extremely proud of our beer being placed at Hy-Vee.¬† There is a tremendous opportunity for Major Hemp HIPA to be placed at each of their 245 store locations.¬† Mahaska has been doing a fantastic job with distribution and official entry into Hy-Vee will only open more opportunities throughout the Midwest with larger retail customers.‚Äù

The Company also reports that Major Hemp HIPA has nearly sold out of inventory with the first placements of Major Hemp HIPA at Tony‚Äôs Finer Foods (‚ÄúTony‚Äôs‚Äù). In tandem with distributor B&amp;D Syndicate, the Company is working on replenishing supply to the 15 Tony‚Äôs stores in the greater Chicago market heading into the busy Summer beer drinking season.¬† In addition, Major Hemp HIPA has been reordered after initial test store placements including Mariano‚Äôs and 7-Eleven.¬†

Chief Executive Officer, Syman Vong commented, ‚ÄúMajor Hemp HIPA has sold extremely well in pubs, restaurants and liquor chains such as Binny‚Äôs Beverage Depot.¬† The addition of larger supermarket chains such as Hy-Vee and Tony‚Äôs are a central part of our growth plans and we‚Äôre thrilled to be making such rapid progress with these notable customers.‚Äù

Sipp Industries also announces an important update to shareholders on the progress of its submitted CBD-infused beer recipe.¬† This past week, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax &amp; Trade Bureau (‚ÄúTTB‚Äù) provided additional instructions for submission of regulatory documents to the Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù).¬† The Company is actively working with the FDA to provide all necessary information to gain official recipe approval.¬†",2019-05-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bmlmj4/sipc_sipp_industries_announces_major_hemp_hipa/

**SACRAMENTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2019 /** Falcon Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: FLCN), a company focused on the marketing, sale, and distribution of CBD products and products derived from industrial hemp announced today that in addition to plans to launch other dermal-delivered CBD products, the company will launch the ""CBD Transdermal Sports Patch XR"".

Over the past few months, Falcon has filed two provisional patents and is also advancing the planned product line for acne, psoriasis and rosacea. These skin conditions represent a very large affected population within the United States.

Central to Falcon's business plan is to develop CBD products that deliver therapeutic amounts of CBD with additional product formulation benefits to the customer. Falcon plans on releasing 2 extended release products. One will be a CBD transdermal sports patch. With the ""CBD Transdermal Sports Patch XR"", CBD is released steadily and consistently over a 24-48 hour period. The other product is an oral extended release product which will release the complete CBD dose steadily over a 12-hour period. Falcon is currently engaged in discussions with 2 other publicly-traded companies regarding the oral product.

Universally known as CBD, Cannabidiol (the scientific name for CBD) is one of at least 80 active cannabinoids identified in both cannabis and industrial hemp. It is a major constituent of both plants, although the percentages of total composition can vary greatly from strain to strain. Unlike THC (the other prevalent cannabinoid), CBD is non-psychoactive while having the potential to possess a variety of therapeutic properties.

The 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp, removing this plant rich in CBD and nutritional supplements from the Controlled Substance Act and categorizing it as an agricultural commodity. This bill will allow states to regulate hemp farming while moving the industrialization of the hemp plant forward. As industrial hemp once again becomes one of America's most popular agricultural crops, the amount of CBD processed from the plant will grow exponentially. The hemp-CBD market is projected to grow from $600 million in 2018 to $22 billion by 2022.

Over the past 2 months, CVS, one of North America's largest drug store chains began selling topical CBD products.

William Delgado, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Technologies commented, ""We are excited about this new product. It will have significant applications and patient use well beyond sports activities. Before we launch the product, we will review a lab analysis to make certain that the CBD dose is released steadily and consistently over the life of the patch. Products like this are potential CBD game changers.""

William Delgado concluded his comments by saying, ""Falcon is currently engaged in discussions with 2 other publicly-traded companies regarding a planned extended release oral CBD. We expect to be able to provide an update within a few days.""",2019-05-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bmmjt1/flcn_falcon_technologies_adds_cbd_transdermal/
