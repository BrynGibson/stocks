7,Opinions please: This looks interesting ILA - ilookabout (ILA.V and ILATF),dfozyw,Clineran1066,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dfozyw/opinions_please_this_looks_interesting_ila/,6,2,"I've lurked on reddit for a long time - first time post. Please be kind.

A broker I know in Toronto went to a tech conference last week and he has been raving about a real estate tech company (he uses the term proptech) that presented.

The name of the company is ilookabout.  The tickers are: ILA on the TSX Venture exchange and ILATF on the US OTCQB

Here's the website:

 [http://www.ilookabout.com/](http://www.ilookabout.com/)

Here is their investor deck:

 [http://www.ilookabout.com/investor-relations/presentations/](http://www.ilookabout.com/investor-relations/presentations/) 

&amp;#x200B;

His key points were this:

1. Really good Management:
   1. Gary Yeoman founded Altus Group Limited (AIF on Toronto Stock Exchange). He also was the founding investor in Real Matters (REAL).
   2. Jordan Ross joined from Altus
2. New Board Member from BMO (Bank of Montreal)
3. Tightly held stock structure. Insiders, Management, Institutions hold around 70% of the stock.
4. Super cheap price
   1.  he said if you use $30M revenue which is about 20% over the last 12 months revenues of the two companies combined that you would have Enterprise Value/Revenue of about .70 while comparables are at 4.5. Simple math says that 2X EV/REV would be around 60 cents and that 4.5 X EV/REV would be $1.50

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at their presentation it looks like a serious company with serious clients. Management looks amazing.

Am I missing something? Volume looks to be up a lot since the conference that was last Thursday.

Would like other's peoples opinion. I've bought a bit and will buy some more but I want to see if I am missing anything.
