I use parcelpal as the most obvious example here:

They have an Uber-like  workforce and they started working with Amazon.

Canada Post had a labor disruption. USPS is never happy. FedEx had a bad year. How did UPS do? 

That's just a start of the technology disruption, and it has a trickle down effect. 

The truth is cities easily adapt, because the workforce will still be needed. 

What people won't be able to adapt to so easily, is the lack of job security or pension security. But that is irrelevant really. 

It's going to change sooner than people realize. ",2019-01-21

25,KShim79,eeppt13,/r/pennystocks/comments/aibl81/finding_stocks_with_higher_volume_and_percentage/eeppt13/,1,"Tong, I followed Tim when I first started out.

My thoughts on him is he is legit and has made his money from trading pennystocks.

There are some thing he teaches well and some things he does not. I'd say Tim is good for beginners for a few months, but honestly after that you should actually switch to another guy on Profitly.

Check these out:

[https://profit.ly/store/info/306?aff=11737](https://profit.ly/store/info/306?aff=11737)

[https://profit.ly/store/info/298?aff=11737](https://profit.ly/store/info/298?aff=11737)

Mathew Owens is a much better teacher than Tim if you ask me. I've incorporated a lot of the stuff from the two links about in my trading strategy. ***Trading around Equilibrium*** is my favorite product on Profitly- its also one of the cheapest. I would also recommend just subscribing to Mathew's chat room too. Just do it for a month to see what its like. Its MUCH more quiet and mature than the pennystock room on Profitly. Most of the guys in that room trade futures and options though so if you want to trade pennystocks it might not be for you. 

If you're after free material, UK Spreadbetting on youtube is legit from what I can tell. They have a lot of good advice, but they arn't going to give you stuff deep in detail all the time.

Happy to answer any specific questions you might have too!
