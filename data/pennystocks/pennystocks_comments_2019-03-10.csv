Board Members 
Life Clips Inc. 

November 10, 2017 

Dear Board Members 

Please accept this letter as my two week notice of my formal resignation as CEO and as Director of Life Clips. My resignation will be effective on November 24, 2017, unless the board chooses to release me sooner, which I would welcome. 

Since February, I have led the company in the best interest of all shareholders. Unfortunately, the Miami-based convertible note holders continue to strengthen their grip on the Company. As a result, I am no longer comfortable leading or certifying SEC documents on behalf of the Company. Also, I have not been compensated per my employment agreement since July, 2017. 

Attached is a mutual release document and note for my compensation that is due to me. Please review and sign this release and note and return to me prior to November 17th or sooner as the Board may determine. 

Sincerely, 

/s/ Huey Long 



The Miami-based convertible note holders would be the Chuck Arnold/Robert Grinberg/Ben Kaplan/David Stefansky group. They've had a grip on that ticker since Robert Gruder acquired the shell back in October of 2015. 

Chuck and his group even put their preferred attorney (Laura Anthony) in place at LCLP starting back in October of 2015 after they first got their grip on that shell with their lopsided/one-sided financing arrangements. 


The S-1 that was withdrawn this week was from 2016 and it was being used to register a bunch of free trading stock mainly for the Miami-based 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1604930/000149315216012425/forms-1.htm 

It was never made effective so the RW seems like just a long overdue formality. I imagine the debt is aged enough that they probably don't need the S-1 any more anyways. 



Interesting that Jonathan Leinwand is the SEC attorney for LCLP now. He has quite the history with penny stocks. 

From my Notes: 

Jonathan D Leinwand graduated from the University of Miami with honors degrees in Political Science and Communications and graduated cum laude from the University of Miami School of Law. 

Admitted to the Florida Bar on 10/06/1995 

One of the first ventures that Jonathan D Leinwand became involved in was a company named Gemini Integrated Financial Services Corp which he set up in Florida in 1996 with Randy H Lebow of Ontario Canada. 

http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=GEMINIINTEGRATEDFINANCIALSERVI%20F960000031000&amp;aggregateId=forp-f96000003100-a728ff1b-8f24-4d07-97c9-f4b59dbe6a9c&amp;searchTerm=Gemini%20Integrated%20Financial%20Services&amp;listNameOrder=GEMINIINTEGRATEDFINANCIALSERVI%20F960000031000 

Gemini described itself as a financial services corporation which specializes in sourcing and arranging capital, providing financial &amp; business consulting services and performing investor relations functions for small cap companies in North America and abroad. 

https://web.archive.org/web/19970402082153/http://www.geminicorp.com:80/ 

Gemini management personnel included Leinwand, Leonard Rosenberg (the CEO), Andrew Rogul, Larry Maker, and Larry Ginsberg. Leonard Rosenberg is the father-in-law of Jonathan Leinwand. Leonard Rosenberg was at one time a sort of Real Estate ",2019-03-10
11,IrRoscoeMr,ei7c2x7,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7c2x7/,1,"Leonard Rosenberg was at one time a sort of Real Estate mongol in Canada having created an empire of around $50 million in Real Estate assets by 1980 with his Greymac Mortgage Corp. In 1982, Rosenberg sold his company to a friend named Bill Player. Later that same year the two organized a massive real estate fraud involving 10,000 apartment buildings that led to Rosenberg being charged with 13 counts of fraud by the Ontario authorities. 

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/missing-in-action-lenny-rosenberg/article18427795/ 

Rosenberg pleaded guilty at his trial in 1993 and was sentenced to five years in prison. He ended up serving less than a year before getting released. Rosenberg created Gemini Integrated Financial Services Corp with his son-in-law, Jonathan Leinwand, a short time later. It is possible that Leinwand may have learned much about the stock fraud trade through his father-in-law, Leonard Rosenberg. 

Gemini shows up owning stock in Value Holdings Inc (VALH) between 1996 - 2001. Gemini provided investor relation services for Value Holdings Inc (VALH) from 1996 - 2000 with Jonathan Leinwand often signing the press releases. At the same time that Gemini was providing investor relation services for VALH being paid in stock for their services, Jonathan Leinwand was serving as the legal counsel for VALH. One of the executives at VALH, Alison Cohen, was the daughter of the Gemini CEO, Leonard Rosenberg. VALH stopped doing SEC filings in 2002. Later in 2006, Leinwand reinstated the entity changing the name to Galea Life Sciences (GLSN) and conducting a 1:25 reverse split. Leinwand used Galea Life Sciences to do a stock dividend with Innovative Technology Acquisition Corp (ITAQ) before the SEC finally stepped in and suspended then revoked the delinquent filer in 2008. ITAQ which had also been delinquent since 2002 was revoked in 2013. 

In 1997 Jonathan Leinwand became the sole officer/director of a company called PGS Pharmaceuticals Group Inc.

12,IrRoscoeMr,ei7c50d,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7c50d/,1,"PGS Pharmaceuticals Group Inc was used for some kind of foreign boiler room operation run out of Amsterdam. The PGC Pharmaceuticals Group Inc boiler room operation caught the eye of the Australian government who added PGC Pharmaceuticals Group Inc to a pamphlet called ""The Little Black Book of Scams"" that the Australian government provided to warn its citizens about scams. 

Leinwand became the General Counsel and Secretary of GlobeTel Communications Corp (GTEM) starting in June 2005. He would later become the CEO of GlobeTel Communications Corp (GTEM) from September 10, 2007 until August 2009. 

GlobeTel Communications Corp (GTEM) was a very dirty Issuer that became the subject of an SEC investigation starting on September 26, 2006. The investigation led to an SEC Complaint being filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on May 2, 2008 against GlobeTel Communications Corp and three former officers of the Company, Timothy J. Huff, Thomas Y. Jimenez and Lawrence E. Lynch. 

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20550.pdf 

The SEC alleged, among other things, that the Company recorded $119 million in revenue on the basis of fraudulent invoices created by Joseph Monterosso and Luis Vargas. Criminal Charges were also filed against Timothy Huff and Thomas Y. Jimenez with both individuals eventually being sentenced to time in prison. 

https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/miami/press-releases/2010/mm072610.htm 

During the time of the illegal activities Jonathan Leinwand was serving as the secretary, director, and legal counsel for GTEM providing legal opinions for free trading shares being issued by the company. 

After the former management team all got busted, Jonathan Leinwand became the CEO of GlobeTel Communications Corp (GTEM) which was renamed Sanswire Corp (SNSR) under his watch. According to tthe following article not much changed. 

https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/10/12/the-end-of-an-ugly-story.aspx ",2019-03-10
13,IrRoscoeMr,ei7c897,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7c897/,1,"The issuer which was booted off the big boards because of the past frauds allegedly continued to put out questionable press releases. 

Sanswire (SNSR) would end up becoming closely tied to GlobalNet Corp (GLBT) through Growth Enterprises Fund SA (David Phipps, Richard Hirschfeld aka Richard Marshall, and Robert Sensei). The following is a very interesting Complaint filed by Engin Yesil against Growth Enterprise Fund SA that details some of that story. 

https://promotionstocksecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MastiffgroupLLCLawsuit.pdf 

Yesil alleges that Hirshfeld was a disbarred attorney that spent time in jail and Sensei was a former CIA agent that got discharged and put in jail for smuggling huge amounts of drugs. Engin Yesil was himself a convicted felon pleaded guilty to aiding the distribution of cocaine in 1990 getting sentenced to six years in prison. Despite his past, Yesil was involved in several publicly traded companies including serving as the CEO of Wilson Creek Mining Corp (WCRE) in 2008, serving as the CEO of SK Realty Ventures Inc (SKRV) starting in 2007, and as a long long time shareholder in Next Communications (NXGH). The following is another post I made detailing some of the history of Hirshfeld, Sensei, Phipps, and Yesil. 

https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=124968841 

David Levy (now the CEO of TALK) was involved in signing the share exchange agreement with Phipps, Hirshfeld, Sensei, and Yesil which created GLBT. GLBT was named in an SEC Civil Complaint in February 2004. 

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18584.htm 

The Complaint mentions Daniyel Erdberg who along with Thomas Seifert (the CFO) and the Phipps/Hirshfeld/Sensei group moved from GLBT to Sanswire Corp (SNSR) in 2009 taking some of the business operations that were used by GLBT with them. Thomas Seifert ended up working alongside Jonathan Leinwand in SNSR from 2009 - 2011. 

SNSR became World Surveillance Group Inc (WSGI) in April 2011. Jonathan Leinwand allegedly stayed involved in SNSR/WSGI long after he stepped down as the CEO and allegedly helped Przemyslaw Kostro and John Caterham orchestrate a pump-and-dump scheme that turned a $3.6 million investment into well over $21 million in WSGI. 

GlobalNet Corp (GLBT), World Surveillance Group Inc (WSGI), and Sanswire Corp (SNSR) were all named in a lawsuit filed by SPA-SIMRAD Inc against Daniel Wainstein, Marissa Welner, Jonathan Leinwand, Michael Sokoloff, Thomas Seifert, and Mastiff Group, LLC. Sensei and Phipps later recycled some of the same business operations that were used by WSGI into Barry Honig's Orbital Tracking Corp (TRKK) which saw some heavy pump &amp; dump activity last year. 

In October 2011, Jonathan Leinwand became the attorney for Tytan Holdings Inc (TYTN). TYTN was a very scammy Shaun M. Kohlmeier/The Neumark Group, LLC. This IR firm was involved in other scams like MIKP (which also used Jonathan Leinwand as legal counsel), EGOC, GOIG, LKEN, GENG, XNRG, GSRE plus many others at the same time. 

Jonathan Leinwand would end up serving as legal counsel for 5 tickers all linked to Eddie Vakser - ARTS, TDEY, PRPM, MPIX, and EMXC. Leinwand can be seen representing ARTS when the SEC moved to revoke the ticker in 2013.

15,IrRoscoeMr,ei7cf4f,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7cf4f/,1,"Joseph Blumenthal (Bluelife Inc) showed up converting debt into free trading stock in 4 of those tickers - TDEY, PRPM, MPIX, and EMXC. Joseph L Blumenthal was barred for life from participating in penny stocks back in 2001 so he used his wife, Vivian Blumenthal as a front when setting up Bluelife Inc. 

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-45070.htm 

The broker firm used to to liquidate the unregistered stock in all of those tickers was ACAP Financial Inc run by Kirk Lynn Ferguson and Gary Hume. On December 16, 2016, FINRA brought a Final Disciplinary Order against ACAP Financial Inc, Kirk Lynn Ferguson, and Gary Hume. 

https://promotionstocksecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACAPBlumenthal.pdf 

According to the Order, Joseph Blumenthal used his wife, Vivian Blumenthal as a front in setting up two Florida business entities - Bluelife Inc and MLJ Partners Corp. Then with the help of ACAP Financial Inc, Joseph L Blumenthal sold unregistered securities through Bluelife Inc and MLJ Partners Corp in TDEY, PRPM, MPIX, EMXC, and CGRA between January 2011 and December 2013. 

In house counsel for ACAP Financial Inc was Jonathan Leinwand so it is easy to see why ACAP Financial Inc was used to sell unregistered stock in all of the Vakser/Leinwand/Blumenthal Issuers. 

Another ticker mentioned in the ACAP Financial FINRA order was Solos Endoscopy Inc (SNDY) which was a Big Apple Consulting ticker that used Guy Jean-Pierre as its legal counsel and issued free trading stock to Bluelife Inc (Joseph Blumenthal). Big Apple Consulting was also involved in Vakser/Leinwand linked - ARTS, TDEY, and PRPM as well as Leinwand linked GOSY. Jean-Pierre provided legal work for ARTS, TDEY, and PRPM as a predecessor to Jonathan Leinwand in each of those tickers. 

Other ACAP Financial Inc tickers/clients mentioned in the FINRA Order included ERBB, WCUI (Peter Kleppan as the client), MSEI (Jeffrey Martin as the client), AMBS, WTII (Mike Bongiovanni as a client), TADF, and TRKP (Kenneth Orr as the client) - more information in this post I made on the IHUB. 

https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=127623405 

As a result of the FINRA Order, ACAP Financial Inc was expelled by FINRA on December 6, 2016. Kirk Lynn Ferguson received a 2 year suspension on December 16, 2016. And Gary Hume who had some disciplinary issues in the past because of assisted in the sale of the stock during the Greyfield Capital pump&amp;dump scam was permanently barred on April 19, 2017. 
",2019-03-10
16,IrRoscoeMr,ei7ck75,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7ck75/,1,"The ACAP Financial Inc action probably began because of investigations started after Artfest Intentional Inc (ARTS) was suspended by the SEC on June 6, 2011. Edward Vakser illegally signed away over 69 billion shares in Artfest International (ARTS) to toxic financiers and other insiders causing ARTS shareholders to lose over $30 million over the course of less than 2 years which including a couple of huge reverse splits which eventually led to the SEC suspension. 

Eddie Vakser was not the only notable name involved in ARTS. Other key players linked to ARTS and its publicly traded subsidiary, PBS Holdings (PBHG), included Big Apple Consulting, Guy Jean-Pierre, Roy Meadows, Robert Talbot, and David Delaney (Delaney Equity Group). The SEC would end up bringing a disciplinary Order against Guy Jean-Pierre. 

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2012/comp-pr2012-257.pdf 

After his ban, Guy Jean-Pierre continued to write opinion letters to create free trading stock in many of the same issuers that had previously paid him for his services by using his niece's name as a front. 

https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=82522995 

Just with ARTS alone, Guy Jean-Pierre illegally helped to make 69,243,164,790 shares free tradings using 71 bogus opinion letters. Jean-Pierre's forged legal opinions would lead to him getting arrested and serving some time in New York before being transferred into the custody of the Denver FBI because of his involvement in Fusion Pharm (FSPM) - much more here. David Delaney which was a primary broker for the liquidation of much of the free trading stock sold by Big Apple consulting then later used again for the liquidation of free trading stock created using bogus Jean-Pierre opinions was put on 6 months probation and fined $215,000 by FINRA. Later Delaney Equity Group would run into more trouble because of their involvement in the Steve Sanders/Alvin Mirman shell factory scheme. 

https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=124509199 

One more name pops up as being involved in some of these very same tickers - Mastiff Group LLC. Mastiff Group LLC was a Florida company set-up by Jonathan Leinwand in 2014. 

http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=MASTIFFGROUP%20M130000031100&amp;aggregateId=forl-m13000003110-530f1684-120d-4bf8-9dfe-9e861cf5af94&amp;searchTerm=Mastiff%20LLC&amp;listNameOrder=MASTIFF%20N090000062430 

Jonathan Leinwand was listed as the sole manager at the Florida SOS, but other individuals linked to the entity as executives through the company website and other internet sources include Daniel Wainstein, Marissa Welner, and Michael Sokoloff. 

Mastiff Group LLC shows up receiving free trading stock in TDEY, PRPM, and IJJP (all of which had Big Apple Consulting and Bluelife Inc). Mastriff Group LLC also owned stock in PJET with Blulife Inc. In PJET, Marissa Welner was the largest shareholder and Wainstein, Sokoloff, and Leinwand also owned big chunks of stock. Another Mastriff Group LLC ticker was Directview Holdings Inc (DIRV). The CEO of DIRV, Roger Ralston, would end up getting sentenced to 5 months in prison for participating in a data equipment scam. Daniel Wainstein (Marjorie Group) and Marissa Welner (Madison Consulting) each held large amounts of stock in SK3 Group Inc (SKTO) which was a Robert Hipple/Henry Jan cannabis ticker scam that got suspended by the SEC on June 6, 2014.

17,IrRoscoeMr,ei7crka,/r/pennystocks/comments/azezli/leas_question/ei7crka/,1,"On September 9, 2014, Anthony Georgio of SPA-Simrod Inc sued Jonathan Leinwand, Daniel Wainstein, Marissa Welner, Michael Sokoloff, and Thomas Seifert alleging that they ripped him off taking advantage of his need for capital by offering to find him funding and assist his company in going public through a reverse merger. 

https://promotionstocksecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MastiffgroupLLCLawsuit.pdf 

According to Georgio, the Mastriff Group repeatedly delayed providing the services they promised causing Mr. Georgio and his business extensive financial harm. Finally Georgetown Corp (GTCP), which was an old dirty pump&amp;dump ticker, was identified as the target company for the merger/acquisition to take place, but bridge funding that was supposed to come from Jason Buratti through arrangements made by Mastriff Group continued to be delayed. The broken promises cost Georgio other opportunities to seek funding through other sources. Through further investigation, Georgio discovered that Georgetown Corp (GTCP) was not even a good fit for his company because it was nothing but an asset-less, worthless, old dirty shell. In the end the deal was never consummated and decided to sue the Mastriff Group LLC for the damage they did to his business. The lawsuit was settled out of court and dismissed.

It's really kind of a chain reaction. Once the price hits some arbitrary point the price drop occurs in much the same way by profit taking, shorting and with stop loses being triggered all the way down. ",2019-03-10
