Alberta has proposed a 1 billion dollar oil upgrading plan and Bayshore petroleum is a company based in Alberta who specializes in just that. They are quiet right now, not much action but they are trading at 3 cents. Last week was 1.5 when I bought in. I think they may pay off in the long run.

After a series of calls between the debt buyer and Carebourn they will be discussing further details today/tomorrow with documentation no later than Friday. Our new attorney should have a licensing agreement completed by then so that everything can close simultaneously. Fingers crossed that we all end up on the same page!

In the meantime our Playboy Club investors are landing Tuesday for a walkthrough on Wednesday. We’re bringing an LoI in hopes that they are as impressed as the commercial vendors are.

On the Guard Lite front we had a great meeting with Quinn Sales and Marketing and Ryan O’Leary on Sunday to go over additional changes to the design based on feedback from MetalFab. We hope to get the new CAD drawings up so we can push the website to live and begin building a few for our potential distributors over the next few weeks.

Lastly, we will be filing a few 8-Ks over the next few days covering developments that fell behind when our attorney passed. Name change, new subsidiary, and the Integro settlement to name a few.",2018-03-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/84lmm4/libe_isnt_going_to_stop/

I have done options trading in the past but wasn't really that successful. 

I have £280 in disposable income every month and 0 saved up how would i go about starting to learn to do penny stocks from a beginner to a pro? I know about those practice/pink sheets but i would like a website or two to help me learn about penny stocks, something that tells me when i should go into a stock and how do i read the news to tell if the penny stock will go up or down? Hoe do i read financial earnings to see if the stock will go up or down?

my goal is to make this £280 into something alot more.

Edit: i know about pump and dumps but how could i trade so i could take advantage of this?
