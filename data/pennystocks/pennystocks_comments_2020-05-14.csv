I’ll give you some real quick, though.  Penny stocks are almost all pump and dump.  This place helps with the pump part by hyping rumors, exaggerating news and even sometimes fabricating both.  

The best way to make money off of penny stocks is to get in sync with the pump and dump wave.  Set a target and try to consistently hit it and get out when you do and don’t look back.  Rinse and repeat.  Don’t try to get rich quick from penny stocks.  It is extremely rare for one to take off to the moon and stay there.  If you get a multi-day bull run then that’s lucky, but you shouldn’t be proud of yourself for holding that long.  You got lucky.  Shoot for a certain percent you want to make on each stock and set a stop loss.  Make it boring and formulaic and you’ll slowly build your portfolio.  However, just like anything, you’ll have to learn the lessons yourself so hopefully you don’t go broke before you start to figure this game out.

Edit: Don’t get too caught up in the news either.  I do a lot of DD for long term investments, but I don’t even know what companies I’m buying when I’m day trading penny stocks half the time.  I just watch for certain things and try to ride the pump until I hit my target.  If it continues to rise after I sell, oh well.  I never look back.  I’m not looking to dump at the max.  I take my money and leave before the panic sell starts when it dumps.  Think of it like leaving a ballgame early.  You had a good time for 8 innings.  What’s one more inning mean?  It means sitting in fucking traffic for an hour before you even hit the freeway.

“In February 2020, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement, subject to completing satisfactory due diligence, to acquire the assets of GRC Trucking, a New Jersey based full-service logistics provider specializing in the import/export ocean and rail intermodal and drayage shipping, by March 31, 2020. However, due to the COVID outbreak, the parties are having ongoing discussions about when it would be appropriate to resume the process.”

“Our expansion in the second half of 2019 reflected our expectation for a very busy holiday season, based upon our relationship and discussions with Amazon. As such, the Company increased its number of vehicles, drivers, and independent contract drivers in anticipation of an increase in business during the holiday shopping season. In addition, the Company opened several new locations in the States of Georgia, Florida, Ohio and Tennessee, during the months of October through December 2019, adding to our existing locations in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. This expansion contributed to the $10.0 million of revenue generated during the final quarter of 2019, which was nearly one-third of total revenue for the year.
 
“However, during this ramp up and rapid growth of volume in the fourth quarter, the Company was experiencing significant cash flow constraints which put substantial financial pressure on the Company during December 2019 and January 2020. In retrospect, the revenue growth we experienced came at a cost, as margins declined, and operating expenses grew. As a result, short-term debt increased in an attempt to compensate for the cash flow deficiency.”


“As our need for financial restructuring became clear, we temporarily halted our strategy to aggressively acquire related businesses in the transportation and logistics industry. As the industry is highly fragmented and there are many acquisition opportunities available to build our business, we first need to ensure that our foundation is fiscally sound.”


“The Company plans to file its Annual Report by no later than May 14, 2020, 45 days after the original due date of its Annual Report.”",2020-05-14

&gt;Novavax Among First-Tier Coronavirus Vaccine Plays, Oppenheimer Says  
&gt;  
&gt;Following CEPI's $384-million grant, supporting scale-up of  manufacturing and conduct of clinical trials, Oppenheimer introduced a  revenue model for NVX-CoV2373, DeGeeter said in a Tuesday note.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We view CEPI and BARDA as the two primary funding mechanisms for  rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines and as effectively the  gatekeepers for prioritizing the most promising science,"" the analyst  said.   
&gt;  
&gt;With the CEPI grant, Novavax joins Moderna, **Johnson &amp; Johnson** [JNJ 0.01%](https://benzinga.com/stock/jnj#NYSE) and **Sanofi SA** [SNY](https://benzinga.com/stock/sny#NASDAQ) in the first tier of COVID-19 vaccine companies, he said.   
&gt;  
&gt;The company's Matrix-M saponin-based adjuvant offers a competitive  advantage, supporting rapid scale-up with smaller vaccine antigen doses  and offering potential benefit in older subjects, according to  Oppenheimer. ",2020-05-14

Is that not literally every company here?

Let's be frank, if any of these companies were ""legitimate locks"" they wouldn't be penny fucking stocks. 

I mean here's the deal, with most of the companies posted here they're only retrospectively clear to the forum as a whole as being pumped and dumped. You'll get a lot of arm chair Buffets in the post-mortem threads, but despite a lot of ""I always knew what this was and when to jump off"" that's not really always true.


I got news for everyone here, anyone who is sitting here telling you they knew exactly what stocks were going to bust and and when to jump off is bullshitting you, if they had that clairvoyance skill they wouldn't be on a fucking Penny Stock subreddit with other guys investing $80 and going ""to the moon!""

That was literally the only ""DD"" listed in any post, just a bunch of threads reading the same shareholder letter and then rewording it and explaining how this was ""primed to the moon"". No one did any research to see what the contract with Amazon looked like, no one confirmed if the celebrity endorsements were actually real, just a single shareholder letter that spawned a 1,000 boats of hope. GNUS appears to be real (although I've yet to see much ""DD"" beyond extrapolation of that single PR), but that doesn't mean it wasn't for a very long time just the same type of stock that we see banged around here every day by one persons haphazard DD.


Same thing goes for KTOV, they've got FDA approval and distributing rights? Awesome, so does every penny pharma company that is rolled out here, that doesn't mean anything, none of this is actualized. I have a beach house named AYTU to sell you if you think that those two things make it legitimate.


Here's the issue, you've conflating shitty stocks with the outright fraud of MVIS and UAVS. You've found two penny stocks that hit it for this month, that doesn't mean that there was a level of DD that really supported that these were legit vs. the thousands in this forum that fall apart. It's a fucking crapshoot, and it's disingenuous to act like you've got some sort of golden vision for Penny Stocks when you've conveniently hand picked probably the two biggest winners of the month.


Full disclosure, I didn't invest in any of the stocks we're talking about. I didn't touch UAVS, MVIS, GNUS, or KTOV. I never followed SALM10, didn't even know who the guy was until two days ago. My ""chip on my shoulder"" is the countless threads in this forum that seem to talk down to the other posters as if they're humongous dipshits, and are really just designed to self congratulate on your earnings. I've actually done pretty well on the penny stocks I've picked (up 5% in the last month), but I'm under no delusion that I've actually done anything but luck the fuck out. The issue here is that too many people who luck the fuck out begin to think it wasn't luck at all and that they've got the magic penny stock brain. For the bajillionth time, these are all Penny Stocks for a reason, if they were predictable they wouldn't be under $5. Trying to act like you've cracked the code is silly and disingenuous. People who come in here to talk down to other users who crashed out are really only doing it to fluff their ego. I have no issue with sharing your DD philosophy that has worked for you, maybe there are points in there that help. But the needless digging at other users is old and lame. 


In the end the penny stock god comes for us all. Sit here long enough telling everyone that their DD was trash, but your DD that you took from a single PR was legit and you'll find out that most penny stock ""due diligence"" is just a series of biting on bait the company wants you to. Whether that company has what it takes to make real money is what really is the ultimate decider and unfortunately I've yet to see a shareholder letter or press release that was honest about that.",2020-05-14

I generally put 10-20% of my account into one trade and try not to trade too much so that means some days I trade a lot and some days I don’t trade at all. Every day I’ll check my balance sheet which shows settled funds available to trade. I just make sure not to trade more than that amount in one day and as long as you don’t trade your whole account on your first day you’ll have funds to trade the next day.

And enough small missteps like that can quickly add up and wipe out an entire great trade. 

I've just been putting in money at $100 intervals, doing the day trade, and then waiting the 2-3 days to reload, not usually getting into more than 2 stocks at a time (might be better for a beginner having less stocks to keep track of anyway).

Oh yeah, super exaggerated statements of having deals with Amazon, Apple TV, Comcast, Cox, Dish, Sling, Roku, Android, Apple iOS, Tubi and Xumo. Plus that super duper exaggerated toy deal with Walmart dropping in August. It literally took me 30 seconds to find both of those articles where they announced signed contracts with all of those providers. *Most of which GNUS already use as a platform for their content*.  Plus its free and paid for with ads which guaranteed will be used to advertise the toys for the shows. That kind of product synergy and market appeal during this ""super long summer"" for kids is going to be insane. This service is going to be a juggernaut.

I can try to answer for you and /r/SaniDoshi as someone who has been following this stock closely. If you look at the chart over the last 15 days, it's been in a steady downward trend with each day setting a new low for the period. That's not a bullish stock or a reflection of the company's performance/outlook though. The shares are just being diluted, and [naked shorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) appears to be pushing the price down. 260 million short orders of this stock from institutional investors 

Yesterday, the company filed a 15-day extension of their 10-Q, so we have another 2 weeks until earnings, which are going to be significantly higher than the share price indicates even in a conservative scenario. We don't know when dilution will end, but as soon as it does, the stock will immediately adjust upwards because every fundamental already shows the stock is ridiculously undervalued.",2020-05-14

Left side is what the bid is or what the limit price someone will pay for the stock. The right side is the ask or the price the seller is willing to sell the stock for. Also it shows the number of shares each is willing to buy and sell. I am not sure exactly how many zeros you add but I think it’s two. Looking at that chart you have a big seller at the certain price. I believe it was 210 but I can’t go back and see. If you did a market order you would buy at the cheapest ask price. I big seller means the stock will usually go down in price. Hope this helps.,2020-05-14

1063,NugSquisherson,fqki4uv,/r/pennystocks/comments/gjeczl/how_to_read_l2_other_than_bidask_not_sure_if_im/fqki4uv/,3,"Think of it like a marketplace — Left side are guys holding up signs saying I’m buying for X dollars. Guys on the right are holding signs saying I’m selling for Y dollars.

Difference between X and Y is called a “spread.”

What you see here is “market depth,” or Level 2 information which is “deeper” than the typical “bid/ask” + “lot numbers” you usually see. You should even be able to see the number of shares for sale and number of lots — maybe toggle a setting.... You can see here the number of shares that pop up at key support and resistance areas. Look at this alongside your charts.

Level 2 is a useful tool, but like all tools it has limitations. You will watch MMs (market makers) cover up large bid and ask lots to create a prettier picture on L2.... in markets with typically little liquidity (penny stocks) this is especially important to pay attention to... watch for “hidden” blocks. Watch for “dilutors” - to name a few: CFGN, OTCX, GLED, VFIN , and often ARCA and VNDM .... Also be wary of ASCM (normally short) on the Ask in stocks ...
And then you get groups rolling in on plays and put up “walls” for their pals to load, etc.... ETRF = Etrade... CDEL, CSTI, and NITE are typically retail.

Keep watching it and learning from it. Pay attention to this, share structure (AS, OS, float, dilution, etc) and study trendlines and candle stick charting because L2 on its own, though a fantastic tool, doesn’t always paint a clear picture.

Another pro tip ... AoN orders (all-or-none) don’t show up on Level 2...... try it out and put up a hidden bid. Have fun &amp; GL.",2020-05-14

I was trying to save people money for those who weren't sure whether to hold during the conference call, and buddy had the nerve to imply that I was trying to create panic. I don't understand why I'd even want to attempt stock manipulation for something I don't own, but that's besides the point.

Low RSI = increase in price
High RSI = decrease in price

Theoretically

If you see that a stock has decreased in price and also has a low RSI, you could assume with some degree of relative safety that the price will increase but the RSI does not tell you how much the price will increase or decrease.

You could even see a pattern like this:

Open @ $2 RSI==57
-2% move to $1.96 RSI==42
+1% move to $1.94 RSI==60
-4% move
-2% move

It's being propped up by rumors right now.

&gt;KTOV good news, but looks dead.

It was overpumped and everything was priced in to begin with

&gt;MARK is dying

Not sure about that. Another PR might spike it again and they do actually have some partnerships. We will see.

&gt;GNUS I think will settle at $1 this weekend

Same situation as MARK. But also was a bit overblown and suffered from buyer fatigue but has solid footing behind them and room for growth. I honestly would be surprised if it drops that low considering how much big news going forward is confirmed.

&gt;IZEA probably a 2 week hold before we see movement again

Likely to hold stable because those selling today will be offset by those buying for Monday demo thinking it will shoot up. Its staying power has been significant.

Its entirely possible, however, that he actually closed up his account partly because his predictions were affecting the stock immediately. You'd think that'd be a good thing for him as stocks would rise whenever he posted about a company. But, it just creates a short term bubble that bursts shortly after his predictions which then may affect his actual prediction of a stock rising in the next week or so.

I was highly suspicious of him being a pump and dumper. I just didn't see that as anything that'd affect me. Buy his prediction, put in a trailing stop sell and profit.

Note the stock price on the 11th closed at \~0.81and they announced their public offering after hours, they predicted  \~23c loss once announced, and AH hours it closed \~0.62. As to the person whom said it was only going to go into effect in 2021, I do not even see the numbers ""2021"" anywhere in the entirety of the offering filing (Note the below is from the 424B5, NOT the 8k)

&gt;After giving effect to the sale of 12,000,000 shares of our Common Stock in this offering at an offering price of $0.454 per share, and after deducting estimated offering fees and expenses payable by us, our net tangible book value as of December 31, 2019 would have been approximately **$0.635 per share of Common Stock. This represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $0.233** per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $0.181 per share to investors participating in this offering.

Learn to look at the charts, look for consistency and support.  Maybe if the company is in the business of something your interested in you may be able to gauge it better.

You want to be able to determine the length of the hold as well. Like is it something you should hold for a day, week , or month?
Looking at the charts and volumes should help you get a feel for this.

As you get better start looking into company financials and forward thinking plans.  This will help round out your experience as you move to investing larger sums.  

Always remember to try and avoid panic, and avoid FOMO. These are the extremes that will damper your learning.  Not to say don't trust yourself, but be mindful.

OVV is another great one to swing trade. Bounces between 5.80 and 6.80 all the time. I’m long on some of my shares but always skim profits off some at the peaks.

VGI is a bit more expensive. Typically trades between 9.80 to 10.20. So I don’t make as much on it as I do the others, but it’s always a good security net for me to make small gains while the others are waiting on a dip.

Also check out EAST and NLS. EAST bounces between 1.60 to 1.90 on the regular with low volume. It always has the potential to spike if volume does pick up. NLS has been riding really high lately bouncing between 5.55-6.20.  Earlier this year it was around 2.20.",2020-05-14

I’m up 47% right now for the past 2 months thanks primarily to $DFFN &amp; $BIOC. But I knew the risks well before hand. By following that method I was able to pre-plan their price action well before anyone else. For example I called $DFFN months ago and bought in at .27 cents.

TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc., a Florida corporation is a global provider of disinfection and decontamination essentials through its premier Binary Ionization Technology® (“BIT™)” platform, under which it manufactures, licenses, services and sells its SteraMist® brand of products, including SteraMist® BIT™, a hydrogen peroxide-based mist and fog.

Invented under a defense grant in association with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense, BIT™ is registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and uses a low percentage hydrogen peroxide as its only active ingredient to produce a fog composed mostly of a hydroxyl radical (**.**OH ion), known as ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (“iHP™”). Represented by the SteraMist® brand of products, iHP™ produces a germ-killing aerosol that works like a visual non-caustic gas.

TOMI introduced SteraMist® to the commercial market in June 2013. In June 2015, we successfully registered SteraMist® BIT™ as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent, at which time it became the first EPA-registered hospital-healthcare and general disinfectant registered solution and technology disinfection system on the market.

               TOMI’s products are designed to service a broad spectrum of commercial structures, including, but not limited to, hospitals and medical facilities, bio-safety labs, pharmaceutical facilities, meat and produce processing facilities, universities and research facilities, vivarium labs, all service industries including cruise ships, office buildings, hotel and motel rooms, schools, restaurants, military barracks, police and fire departments, and athletic facilities. TOMI products are also used in single-family homes and multi-unit residences.

***Our Technology***

BIT™ was developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist (0.3-3 um in diameter) that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals (“.OH”). ROS cause damage to pathogenic and resistant organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, viruses, mold spores, other fungi and yeast, via oxidation of proteins carbohydrates, lipids and rendering the building blocks of nature- amino acids, DNA and RNA inactive - leading to cellular death, disruption and/or dysfunction.

Testing detailed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense demonstrates these hydroxyl radicals, aggressively break the double bonds and other bonds in bacterial spores, biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after our EPA-registered solution passes through an atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result - our **.**OH hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as iHP™. This patented process allows these hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity, while seeking to attach with any and all surfaces within the proximity of TOMI’s mist.

The sole active ingredient of BIT™ is a low percentage (7.8%) Hydrogen Peroxide and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist® brand of products. Our technology produces a germ-killing aerosol that moves throughout a space like a gas. Our technology is able to efficiently and effectively kill pathogenic and resistant organisms in the air and on the surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water in the form of humidity. SteraMist® is designed to be easily incorporated into any industry’s current cleaning procedures; is economical, non-corrosive and easy to apply; leaves behind no residues; and requires no manual wiping.

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we are required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of disinfectants. In June 2015, SteraMist® BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and general broad-spectrum surface disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist® BIT™ now holds EPA registrations (# 90150-2) for mold control, and air and surface remediation (# 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include *C. diff*”) spores and MRSA, as well as the influenza virus h1n1, which we believe has better positioned us to penetrate all industries including the bio-defense and healthcare industry. In August 2017, our EPA label was further expanded to include efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. As of January 27, 2017, our technology is one of 53 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium *difficile* Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List. Further, in December 2017, SteraMist® was included in the EPA’s list G (Norovirus), L (Ebola) and M (Avian Flu). Currently, our EPA-registered label is in all fifty (50) U.S. states as well as many other countries.

SteraMist® is being used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), C. *diff*, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”) and Ebola Virus Disease (“Ebola”). In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist® is being used for terminal cleaning, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of *C. diff* spore rates. SteraMist® has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella *pneumoniae,* AB, pseudomonas *aeruginosa*) at large hospital to small clinics and has contributed to the control of MERS and Ebola throughout the world.

Our technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus *stearothermophilus*. Geobacillus *stearothermophilus* is the laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. In May 2015, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded us a grant in the amount of $559,000 for the development of SteraMist® Mobile Decontamination Chambers to fight Ebola. In May 2016, upon the decontamination and decommissioning of an Ebola treatment center in West Africa, we fully achieved the milestones upon which the grant was conditioned. Additionally, BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including weaponized anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.

All our SteraMist® products are fully validated to comply with good manufacturing practice standards, have received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our solution is manufactured at an EPA-registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by good laboratory practice efficacy data for Staphylococcus *aureus*, Pseudomonas *aeruginosa*, Salmonella, Norovirus, mold spores, MRSA, h1n1, Geobacillus *stearothermophilus* and C. *diff* spores.",2020-05-14

*SteraMist®* *Surface Unit*

Our SteraMist® Surface Unit is a fully portable, handheld, point and spray disinfection/decontamination system intended to provide quick turnover of any affected space. The single applicator unit enables disinfection of all surfaces, including high touch, sensitive equipment and electronics. An application time of only five seconds per square foot and seven-minute contact time allows for safe re-entering of the space within minutes after applying the iHP™ mist.  
 It can be used as a standalone hospital terminal clean product or as an adjunct to ultraviolet disinfection and is a perfect solution to exit and entry barrier points of a facility. The SteraMist® Surface Unit does not require heating, ventilation or air conditioning systems to be shut down. Further, its touchless application (no wipe, no rinse) reduces risk of cross-contamination between treated surfaces.

*SteraMist Environment System*  
   
Our SteraMist® Environment System is a transportable, remotely controlled (robotic) system that provides complete room disinfection/decontamination of a sealed space up to 103.8 m3 (3,663 ft3) in just over 75 minutes (application, contact, and aeration time). Individually, each remote applicator can be used to treat a space of approximately 34.6 m3 (1,221 ft3). Injection times are based on individual room size and number of applicators. Multiple SteraMist® Environment Systems can be used simultaneously to accommodate larger or multiple spaces with fast application and minimal down time. Our hybrid technology applicators can be used in both manual and/or fogging modes.  
Our SteraMist® Environment System features additional programmable and printable features in PDF format. Other key features include lot # of BIT™ Solution, location identifier, injection/dwell/aeration times, and error notifications.

*The SteraMist**®* *Hospital Disinfection Cart*  
   
The Hospital Cart was designed by request of multiple public healthcare facilities EVS (Environmental Service) teams using our equipment for the SHIELD study that TOMI is participating in. The cart houses our Surface Unit, a portable H2O2 monitor, Carbon Air Scrubber, MaxAir Helmet Respiratory Protection System with positive pressure air flow, storage hooks, and a sign notifying the room is being treated. Included with the Cart is a custom ICU 45-55 minute terminal cleaning protocol.

*SteraMist®* *Select Surface Unit*  
   
Our Select Unit was designed to meet the needs of our customers who have smaller enclosures in need of decontamination. This unit is lightweight and easy to transport with the added ability to function between a lower flow operation and standard operation, such as the SteraMist® Surface Unit. The user can adjust air flow, adjust pump fluid flow, set the programmable timer for automatic runs, modify spray/dwell times and number of cycles, and is equipped with start and stop buttons.

*SteraMist**®* *Permanent iHP**™* *Complete Disinfection Room*

The SteraMist® Permanent iHP™ Disinfection Room is an automated system that is plumbed utilizing the facilities’ existing HVAC system. This involves permanently installing SteraMist® applicators within the designated space to achieve maximum results. The generator and Programmable Logic Control (“PLC)” are housed in a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA)” enclosure in a central remote location. The entire system can be developed for multiple rooms and various specifications, controlled remotely through the NEMA interface. The status of the decontamination cycle is monitored with indicators and can be integrated into a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (“SCADA)” monitoring board.

*iHP**™* *Plasma Decontamination Chamber*  
   
With prior written approval our patented cold plasma technology can be integrated with a chamber or cage washer by leading manufacturers. Current examples are Lynx, BetterBuilt and Allentown. The photo demonstrates our iHP™ Decontamination Chamber built into a lab at the University of Houston. Our custom generator/chamber is built into a stainless-steel single door panel and is permanently mounted next to the chamber or washer, while a SteraMist® applicator is permanently or semi-permanently mounted in the enclosure. This SteraMist® product line includes but is not limited to an internally mounted air compressor, regulator for air pressure adjustment, E-stop button, lever power switch, data logging functions, and multiple dry contract outputs determined by the needs of the customer.

*iHP™* *Service Decontamination*  
   
TOMI offers full room, equipment, facility, and emergency disinfection/decontamination services. Our goal is to reduce bioburden and eliminate the potential for costly microbial contamination preventing laboratory outbreaks. If a lab is dealing with a current outbreak TOMI’s iHP™ service will contain and prevent future outbreaks. Single and routine services are provided to TOMI customers to coincide with maintenance, mandatory facility shutdowns, or to control a specific threat.

Total revenue in the first quarter was flat year over year at $4.8 million, with revenue from Managed Services increasing 7% to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2019. Revenue from SaaS Services decreased to $583,000 in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $913,000 compared to the same period in 2019. Revenue from Managed Services increased as a result of increased bookings in the second half of 2019 that led to increased revenues in Q1 2020. Revenue from SaaS Services decreased primarily as a result of lower spend levels from our SaaS marketers and as a result of competitive pricing efforts which reduced our margins on those spends. Our SaaS marketers decreased their spend levels as they transitioned from the TapInfluence platform to IZEAx and curtailed spending in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19.


Total costs and expenses in the first quarter of 2020 were $10.9 million compared to $6.5 million in the corresponding quarter of 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $4.3 million impairment of goodwill recorded in the first quarter of 2020, reduced by a loss of $191,000, associated with our first quarter 2019 settlement on a portion of our accrued acquisition costs. 


Net loss in the first quarter of 2020 was $6.2 million or $(0.18) per share, as compared to a net loss of $1.8 million or $(0.15) per share in the first quarter of 2019, based on 34.7 million and 12.6 million shares outstanding, respectively.


Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure management uses as a proxy for operating cash flow, as defined below) in the first quarter of 2020 was $(1.2) million compared to ($874,000) in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was negative twenty-five percent (25%) compared to negative eighteen percent (18%) in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily due to $250,000 less in capitalized expenses related to our internal software build of IZEAx 3.0 and a $73,000 increase in advertising and marketing efforts in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.

Thanks to “tampa002” on iHub for finding this one... journal from 2018 on the “to be developed” helmets with OLED display... 

Not sure if these dots were already connected by somebody but the CC was hush hush about mentioning specifics of companies

From p. 3:


“Heads-Up Holy Grail 
Still to be developed is a helicopter helmet able to integrate aircraft sensor imagery with symbology in a wide field-of-view, high- resolution, binocular, full-color, totally crashworthy HMD. Tom Harding at USAARL acknowledged, “That’s still the Holy Grail, that plus high brightness for really good contrast in daylight conditions. Some systems that we’re developing now have some high-brightness features. The older systems are fairly dim by comparison.” 
The Army Product Manager Apache Sensors in Huntsville is working with the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center at Rock Island, Illinois, to modernize the Apache Integrated Helmet And Display Sighting System (IHADSS). The monocular IHADSS has a field of view 40 degrees horizontal by 30 degree vertical. It shows the AH-64 pilot and co-pilot/gunner pilotage and targeting imagery with symbology, and it aims the Apache gun. 
Ongoing engineering development aims to replace the obsolete cathode ray tube (CRT) in an ESA helmet display unit (HDU) with a brighter organic light-emitting diode (OLED) flat panel display made by eMagin. OLED technology provides higher brightness, contrast and resolution than CRT displays with less power required. The thick power cable run to the Apache helmet gets notably thinner and lighter with OLEDs. The monochrome OLED HDU completed critical design and test readiness reviews successfully and should finish development in 2019. Program Manager Apache Sensors is meanwhile exploring a follow-on color OLED replacement.”",2020-05-14

They are collaborating on Autonomous and Electrified systems and that’s a great thing! Saves money on both sides and allows for cost sharing across multiple platforms. From the supplier side cost per unit (of whatever shared system) goes down thanks to volume sales. Now what isn’t talked about a lot is VW and trucks. VW does have pickups, but not ones that they believe would do well in the US. So  the joint venture also brings trucks into the fold, VW has a long way to go in regards to the US market but this will for sure push it along. Now one more thing to consider is the potential of Cash For Clunkers 2 (or a variation of). Ford is lobbying hard for it to make a return. Considering that many cars that were purchased during CARS are now old enough to be considered “clunkers”. A good example being the Dodge Caliber, the local U pick is FULL of them. They didn’t stand the test of time. So Ford would be able to offer something like the eco sport as a suitable replacement or empty out their inventory of actual cars (seeing how they stopped production of pretty much everything but the Mustang in terms of cars. I’m not talking SUV, CUV, or Truck). It’s going to be interesting for sure and even if a merger did happen, I believe (hope) that Ford would continue operating this market as they have been.

- MVIS reiterated that they retained all IP rights in their earnings call (fact)

So, if said customer (i.e. Microsoft) doesn't want the IP to land into a competitor's hands, it would make sense to at least acquire the IP rights, if not the whole company, as a defensive measure.

1) They are simply buying their shares back, insider trading already alerted us to what this will go to. They have over 6 months to get the price over a dollar before they have to execute a RS (I’m certain they won’t)

2) it’s the same old scheme I’ve seen hundreds of times. With every piece of good news backing them, they chose to announce RS, as a means of tanking their own stock to buy back low for when this shoots. They clearly used specific verbiage here, “if” it RS, too bad people don’t read between the lines. They used this wording to specify they will not be, but people look past that and panic selling ensues. 

3) they have been doing Stop limit raids, dropping the prices to ensure stop limits trigger, which in turn drops it more. You have to think, it’s barely down from last week, and this week has been awful. Red every day for the past 3 days.

Right now I’ve been putting my momey in Comcast calls (bright me in a nice return today) and looking at Kroger calls as well (not penny’s but what I’ve been doing recently).

4663,TameFoxes,fqonzs9,/r/pennystocks/comments/gjxnkf/pennystocks_twitter/fqonzs9/,2,"I don't know much about Options, so look online for additional resources to aid you. I'll try to summarize what I know, as best I can.

Options are a type of contract that you can buy and sell similar to how you buy and sell stocks. An option contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller to purchase or sell 100 shares of a given stock for a specific price at a specific date.

For example, if I think company XXX, that is selling for $15 right now,  is going to skyrocket when their earnings report comes out in a week, I want to buy a $20 Call Option that expires 5/22/2020. I pay the person selling the contract a fee and now I own a contract that gives me the ""option"" to purchase 100 shares of XXX at $20 apiece by May 22, 2020. The current price is $15 so the option is basically useless right now, but let's say earnings come out and XXX did really well and told the world that it's partnering with Amazon. Now the price of XXX stock is $30 apiece. So I exercise my call option and get to purchase $100 shares of XXX at $20 instead of $30, which is a 100 shares x $10 difference = $1000 profit if I choose to immediately sell the shares I bought on the open market. I can also sell the contract and get a fee that is much bigger than the fee I paid when I originally bought the contract because the contract is now ""in the money"".

Options contracts work in reverse too if you think a company is going down. These are called Put contracts. You get the option to sell 100 shares of a stock at a given price by a specific date.

So let's take the pinned tweet at the top of Unusual Whales twitter.

BA 05/22/2020 P $75

(Company ticker, Expiration date, Put contract, price that you expect stock to go under)

Bid: $0.02 (purchase price buyers want, multiple by 100 to get actual price, $2)

Ask: $0.03 (asking price, multiple by 100 to get actual price, $3)

Interest: 149 (total # of active contracts out there)

Volume: 809 (# of contracts traded)

IV: 115.63% (how much the price moves, higher=good, doesn't give the direction of price)

% Diff: 69.71% (How much the IV has changed)

Purchase: $126.74 (price of the underlying stock)

So Boeing stock is $126.74. This contract stipulates that you think the price will drop below $75 by next Friday, which is a crazy change.",2020-05-14

It seems unfair that the sub decided that because on that day a few weeks back when they had their conference call that since the Amazon wasn't mentioned as a partnership this sub is now off limits to discuss.

I've worked at startups who had rediculously high-profile customers, sports teams, world governments, etc...

Not a single one of them wanted us to use their names or logos in our marketing info, they all insisted on NDAs. The startup basically failed because we could never mention anyone. My point is, big companies do not want to lend their credibility to small companies, it's simply too risky for their image if something were to backfire.

&gt; So they're currently working on partnering with Amazon, an insanely large business that would fulfill all of their wildest fantasies and make everyone rich, but in the meantime they're going to be partnering with a farm and designing software that allows drones to map out hemp farms or something? What logic is that

If their customer really is amazon, which there seems to be overwhelming evidence for, do you think they would turn down business with Bezos because they had some fucking bumpkin hemp contract on the side? Their real market is agriculture, that's the AG in their name, of course they will continue to pursue this, they built the business around it. Amazon is interested for other reasons, why would they turn down a new vertical if money is thrown at them? That's like saying an escort would not accept a super high paying job in an office cause she won't be able to fuck anyone.",2020-05-14

Even if I were to accurately pick a descent company, it most likely would not outweigh all of the bad ones I would end up selecting. I find better success looking for hype and momentum and then taking my little bit and running on to the next stock, hopefully before everyone else. 

However, with all of that being said, I actually feel UAVS is doing pretty good. The huge increase in revenue and the big follow on order is a big deal for them. I feel like the whole Amazon ordeal with them is negatively affecting them and people’s opinions about them, but if they keep doing what they are doing they will be able to push pass all of that.

My advice to you, if you are thinking longer term with this company, is to do what you did here. Post legit positive news and take into consideration all of the replies. It is ok to make quick money off a stock you believe in. You may think the stock will be at 10$ one day, that doesn’t mean that you can sell at 5.50 because it was hyped up by pump and dumpers and then by back in at a lower price and hold out for the 10.
