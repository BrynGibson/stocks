I have dabbled with Robinhood but too restrictive for low ball player like myself. I am not looking to dump a fortune, just casual play to figure out the ropes.
Thanks for any help provided.",2020-01-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/enlak8/newbie/

8,Sorrento therapeutics buyout offer,enq9pd,Father_Earth,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/enq9pd/sorrento_therapeutics_buyout_offer/,1,6,"News article: https://in.reuters.com/article/sorrento-thera-m-a-idINKBN1Z91LI

Thursday 1/9/2020 Sorrento ( SRNE ) Received its second buyout offer in 3 months. Previously valued at 3-5 dollars and rejected. Recent offer at $7. It was made public Friday, and the stock shot up and sits at just under $4.82 for the weekend.

SRNE has multiple products in different stages of clinical trials, with one product currently at market. They develop non-opioid pain solutions. The current environment in pain management is leaning towards non-opioid solutions.

They have a market cap of 783 million. 316 million of debt. High volatility, and high risk

I am long SRNE and own 6 x $2.50 calls. 2 dated 1/17/2020 and 4 dated 3/20/2020. I purchased them 11/26/2019 shortly after the first buyout offer, and am up 200%. I feel as if it could be a lucrative trading opportunity still, and I truly want everyone who reads this to make money and be happy.

I normally don't care about a trip penny stock if it has more than 2 billion O/S regardless of the news or hype...

The OTC's screener doesn't have the feature of searching based on float or O/S and Finviz doesn't have data on trip penny stocks. Is there a screener out there for this? Thanks.",2020-01-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/enu4u7/what_is_the_best_screener_for_looking_up_trip/
