7,bearcatjohnnie,e0f4eq5,/r/pennystocks/comments/8pm4xo/june_08_2018_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/e0f4eq5/,1,It‚Äôs not a pump and dump play. It is a real company with real assets that process biodegradable plastics that have real value. It went bankrupt and the stock basically fell apart hence the Q at the end but because of their intrinsic value they have a great shot at reorganizing and recovery and holding equity for current shareholders. Hence I think it is grossly undervalued and oversold at this level. Also some big name companies are looking to fund bioamber with news of this coming out soon. I‚Äôll check back in at the end of the week but my personal opinion is this will run.,2018-06-08

11,bearcatjohnnie,e0fz3ep,/r/pennystocks/comments/8pm4xo/june_08_2018_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/e0fz3ep/,1,"Assets 69 million, Liabilities 47 million. With out getting into details, the company most likely did not have enough cash on hand to pay short term obligations. Hence they filed for Bankruptcy protection. Stock Price plummets, and they get delisted from the big board. 

That brings us to today. Company is getting DIP financing very soon. They have 6 bids on this currently and will announce this soon. Which gives the company the chance to be saved and pay off short term obligations. Over time the stock price will rise to reflect the true value of a company which is no longer in bankruptcy. (Several dollars was past pps based on fundamentals) In the short term I hope to see substantial increase in the PPS. 50 cents is not out of the question. IMO. Also as far as buying in it‚Äôs very hard to say. I think this gaps pretty big on open Monday morning and there usually is a great buying opportunity after that gap retraces before another run. I am going to buy more then if it happens. Every now and then they gap and just explode so that‚Äôs always a possibility but I typically don‚Äôt chase and just wait for a pullback at a resistance level. Look at Friday‚Äôs chart. 0.014 was the buy in Friday if you played it right.",2018-06-08

Also, this may seem like a dumb question but when you say ‚Äúgap‚Äù what exactly are you referring to? The change in price from the previous trading day?

14,bearcatjohnnie,e0g2v43,/r/pennystocks/comments/8pm4xo/june_08_2018_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/e0g2v43/,1,Yeah if there is a discrepancy between the opening bid/ask price which determines the market price and the closing price from Friday it will gap up to the new asking price if those orders are filled. It will probably happen on this tomorrow morning because lots of buying interest. Usually that gap up will pullback as sell orders usually come in also after so that would be a better buying point. Every now and again it doesn‚Äôt retake and runs like crazy. At that point it‚Äôs impossible to even try to predict what‚Äôs going to happen IMO,2018-06-08

Nice job! $8 is pretty steep, maybe look into setting up your own account, and one with more reasonable fees. They can really eat into profits. And consider establishing some trading ‚Äúrules‚Äù that you follow and I think you will learn over time what works for you. Everyone has their own strategies and whatever ‚Äúrules‚Äù you make for yourself just make sure you stick with them. For example, I set price points that I am willing to sell/buy/hold at to protect profits. So if you decide to buy back in consider what you have invested and taken as profit already to set your risk tolerance going forward. Good luck, do your own research and trust no one!",2018-06-08
