Often times pharmaceutical stocks fail because their drugs don’t get approved. However when their drugs do get approved is when they gain stability + a steady flow of income that makes it so they can make more drugs.  As well as the share price going up making it so an offering for let’s say 10 million shares isn’t worth 1$ per share but 3-10$. This + money from an approved drug makes it so they have funding to develop even more drugs and snowball affect.,2020-03-08
