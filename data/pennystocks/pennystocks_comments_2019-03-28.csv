Short selling theoretically has unlimited risk, as a stock can rise infinitely after youve sold, meaning theres no limit to possible losses.

209,Legend_of_Science,ejsfj4u,/r/pennystocks/comments/b6kxrq/leas/ejsfj4u/,1,"Here are some facts:

1. There has been consistent support at or around 0.0022 with regular peakings at 0.0027 or more, for the last few weeks now.
2. They needed to send amended paperwork to go otc current. That happened mid-week and it takes 3-5 business days or slightly longer in some cases. 
3. Both LEAS and BBDA are being reversed merged into an unannounce company with a market cap of 50 million. 
4. LEAS itself has a market cap of 2 mil. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think peoples opinion is that since the cap goes up 25x, people are looking at the supported price of 0.002 \* 25 = 0.05, which is far larger than i think it will be but even it the price only went to 0.01, that would be great. 

Some other things to think about:

People have been selling at low prices because they think the stock is a bust and/or a p&amp;d scam. After doing my own DD i do not feel that is the case, however it certainly is possible so I am being careful. 

The emotional selling off has been a shortsellers dream, people hear the hype of the stock bumping up, they get emotional and impatient, and decide to sell low. LEAS is a swing traders stock and not a day traders stock unless you are short selling based on emotional trading. 

On the L2 i am seeing people looking to sell at 0.0022 - 0.0024, which is probobly scaring people off. Bulls just need to hold on, imho. It's worth the risk if you are putting in under 400 bucks. At 0.002, $400 nets you 200k shares. If that price goes up, its a worthwhile gain, for minimal risk. ",2019-03-28
