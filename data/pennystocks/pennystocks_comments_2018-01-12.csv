In terms of finding the right small cap stock to day trade you should find someone who has made a proprietary scanner that scans for all kinds of different criteria. Or you could read up on them your self - what is float, volume, momentum and etc and you can search them yourself to find a stock that’s going to move. Don’t listen to manipulated websites that tells you to buy a certain stock. Most small caps are pump and dump and what penny stock traders do is they take advantage of them instead of falling for them. 

My advice would be to read up on it before you lose money. :)",2018-01-12

If you want to “make a quick buck” on a low budget you shouldn’t necessarily look into the company. Fundamental trading is looking into the company and see what potential they have. But what I’ve learned is that every small cap stocks sounds like they are the new Microsoft - you can’t trust that. Therefore I would recommend looking into being a technical trader. 

You can use the app called robinhood to invest with penny’s. try to search for “techbud solution” they are on Facebook and YouTube and he, together with other traders, teach beginners to learn how to think when investing on a low budget.",2018-01-12

They do seem to have a good product.
I really think that after CES is over and everyone is back to work that they will start seeing licensing agreements come in. The StreetInsider new article alluded to it, but one of the biggest issues in on-line clothing sales is returns. Most of those returns are for size. Returns for any company are very expensive. If this technology can cut the return rate by even 25% it would be well worth the investment for the retail companies. 

We are seeing some nice ""news"" pops here and there with this stock just on marketing. But I think the real value will be in the coming weeks as news of new licensing agreements start rolling in. ",2018-01-12
