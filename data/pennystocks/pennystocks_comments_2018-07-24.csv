They’re still very speculative because their greenhouses are under construction. They have a large greenhouse at 160k kg annual capacity fully complete this fall. They have another substantial greenhouse in BC in very early stages.

They have a supply agreement with Canopy to purchase 90k kg over two years once they’re live.

They own an extraction facility in Cali with a handful of customers already. They also have a couple Canadian subsidiaries making money today.

They are fully funded, can expand without dillution with their real estate partner and the CEO was previously a CEO of a vaccine company that was sold for $200m.

Today is a great day to buy because their stock has been beaten hard lately and RSI is low low low - way oversold.",2018-07-24

The senhance machine has true haptic feedback and reusable instruments which can save hospitals tons of money in the long run. Currently the davinci requires new instruments to be used for each surgery.

Youre looking at an average of 1.5 mil robot cost, 100k yearly fee, and 500-1600 per procedure for davinci.

IIRC Senhance costs 1-1.5 million up front, don't know yearly fees, but with reusable instruments per procedure costs will be considerably less than davinci.

The only question is... how big of a market is left since so many hospitals have a davinci already. Florida has been using the Senhance and like it a lot.

I have faith. It's definitely a long term hold for me.",2018-07-24

They are one of the few Marijuana retailers online, possibly seeing massive revenues being generated in the space. Sense they are ahead of the curb.

They raised a $5,000,000 private placement... so money for growth should not be a question.

They are one of the few companies in Canada to be holding the proper license to sell Marijuana. The license process in Canada is extremely difficult and hard to achieve for these upcoming companies.

Hope that shines some light..
