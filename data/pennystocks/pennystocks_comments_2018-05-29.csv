My company went through a buyout so I had some cash sitting in eTrade and used it to invest, with all the talk of legalization in the states and in Canada I figured now was a good time to jump in.  

I have a handful of pennystocks in the weed industry, Kosh bottles KSHB being one of my favorites, and am looking to get into other industries/companies as well.

I should have picked some favorites and stayed the course, but I suppose I'll have to wait and see how it pans out in the long run.
