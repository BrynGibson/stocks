Stocks need to meet certain criteria- basically the company needs to be somewhat stable in order to be traded on a big exchange. As a beginner investor, you want to stick to stocks that are available on a large exchange, like the NYSE. Robinhood is perfect for that. Use this until you learn what you're doing and how to do DD, read a chart, etc.

Once you have a good feel for it, then you should consider finding a different trading platform that lets you trade OTC stocks. These are a lot riskier, and you can easily get burned if you dont know what you're doing. Learn about pump and dump schemes, and learn how to recognize them. A lot of info on this sub is pumpers or people being duped by a pump.

Good luck.",2018-08-04

18,buenotc,e3lxm0s,/r/pennystocks/comments/94jk5t/which_investement_platform_do_you_use/e3lxm0s/,1,"Most of the answers here in this post is hilarious lol.  First thing you OP need to know is what's considered a penny stock and what happens when a stock goes under $1 on the NASDAQ etc. Delistment. If it's not on a major exchange it'll be on the OTC  and trade via pink sheets. 

 What's annoying about trading OTC with vanguard is you have to call them via telephone to make the order like it's still 1980s and pay $25 a trade. 

Many brokerages do not allow you to trade OTC stocks so IDK why people here would even mention M1 etc.  I've seen only US base OTC on vanguard. I haven't seen anything from TSE when I checked on vanguard (probably don't do international?). I also checked for TSE stocks on TOS but I couldn't find anything. From my research I've found that ""speed trader"" and ""just 2 trade"" are the best two brokerages for trading penny stocks"". Good luck.

Yes, You have access to all penny stocks trades on listed exchanges like AMEX, NYSE, NASDAQ. 

Unfortunately RH doesn’t provide an official api but there are unofficial apis that do work.

Honestly if you have time just open an account on whatever you want they all have good and bad things to them. 

I prefer m1 finance over robinhood since m1 is also free commission but they have better investing tools such as fractional shares and drop investing. Robinhood has free options and after hours now. 

Td Ameritrade has think or swim and much more investment and trading tools with the trade off being like 6 dollars in fees.
