I highly recommend you don't try that. Eventually it wont go back up, and you'll be stuck in a nasty position. Not only that, but all the gains you made will be ruined, because that one loss ruined it all. You seem to be concluding that for some reason, buying at .40 = it is a dip-buy. This is not always the case. In fact, I'd argue it's rarely the case. You're more likely going to become a bag holder, and holding until you eventually cut your losses at .10. This ""strategy"" is nothing more than wishful thinking. With the amount of money you're risking, and the fact that it's meant for a retirement fund, I can't recommend anything.

Unlike the ""penny stock"" market, the marijuana market is growing and will continue to increase worldwide. So it is a bit different than investing in XYZ company in some random thing that may or may not increase.

Pennies are great for trading because you can get a quicker roi and get out. People that are voicing Thier concern here are not incorrect in warning you that Penny's typically go to zero. So they are advising you to not invest, and I agree with them.

But your idea of constantly trading to increase your profits, what your calling the wave, is what everyone calls swing trading and they do this all over the place, they just don't do it on pennys. It's a great way to not have to watch the market like you do with day trading. You do this with something reputable where you won't lose your pants over night.

All that said, if you believe in it, enough to put your hard earned money on it, then more power to you. It doesn't matter what anyone else says and I wish you the best. 

A lot of time the small percentage of Penny's that are able to truly break out go on do so for a couple months before they go belly up again. They are usually this cheap because of bad management. What I would argue with you about is why is this so cheap while other pot stocks are substantially more. Cgc and Cron aren't Penny's, so why is this one relegated to a penny?

There are stupid things in the sub as there are in many other public arena’s in regards to penny stocks. It’s fundamental in pennies that someone profits from someone’s loss. Why argue about a fundamental. Stupid imply’s negative morality not amorality. I agree with much of your assessment but I’m not sure why anyone should be surprised at this and unless they are very new should have these bullets engrained by experience alone. So..... I say it’s only stupid if you cannot learn from mistakes, or cannot apply what you’ve learned and become profitable. If I can give any advise it’s keep
