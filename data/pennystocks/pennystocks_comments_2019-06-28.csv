I have 4,900 dollars in 1million shares. This company has some very nice tech that I believe will be well received upon rollout. 10cents is an attainable goal and I don’t think .20 is a stretch. I could be wrong but OTC investing has that kind of volatility whether up or down. The trick is finding a real company with a real product that has real potiential. I believe this is one, and I could be wrong. You should research the tech though and determine if it’s worth the risk. I was right on Shmp last Dec and made some bank. I think TTCM will have a similar type of run when the app rolls out.",2019-06-28

It’s cheep enough right now to acquire a serious volume of shares for a relatively low amount of money.  I figure rollout of the app along with a PR campaign will give us a pretty good shot up. Most will profit out and walk. I’ll probably do the same thing and look for reentry down the road. The company has said that they do not plan on a RS but... if they get a decent move and want out of the OTC an RS can help them uplist. I’ve learned my lesson in the past about holding too long. I’d rather profit out and possibly renter than watch profits tank. That’s  OTC land. Just have to strategize around it.,2019-06-28

If you’re willing to throw money at the odds of such a penny stock on the pink sheets, it would make more sense and have better odds to do buy of the money calls and puts instead.

Right before the shareholder votes are to be taken, to be exact. I believe that’s the best exit from my research.

My opinion, it’s going to drop after the merger is consummated and official. Here’s an excerpt from the S-4 which leads me to believe why;

On June 13, 2019, Ocugen and Histogenics entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with the Investors pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Ocugen agreed to sell to the Investors an aggregate of 4,574,272 shares of Ocugen common stock (the “Initial Shares) and deposit an additional 4,574,272 shares of Ocugen common stock into escrow for the benefit of the Investors if 80% of the volume-weighted average trading price of a share of Histogenics common stock on Nasdaq for the first three trading days immediately following the closing date of the Pre-Merger Financing is lower than the price paid by the Investors for the Initial Shares (the “Additional Shares” and together with the Initial Shares the “Ocugen Financing Shares”), and (ii) Histogenics agreed to issue warrants representing the right to acquire an amount of Histogenics common stock up to the amount issuable in exchange for 200% of the Ocugen Financing Shares upon consummation of the merger, as further described below (the “Series A Warrants”), additional Series B warrants to purchase shares of Histogenics common stock, as further described below (the “Series B Warrants”), and additional Series C warrants to purchase 50 million shares of Histogenics common stock (which number shall not be adjusted as a result of the Histogenics Reverse Stock Split) as further described below (the “Series C Warrants” together with the Series A Warrants and the Series B Warrants, the “Investor Warrants” and, together with the Ocugen Financing Shares, the “Purchased Securities”), and the Investors agreed to purchase the Purchased Securities, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million (subject to setoff for amounts outstanding of approximately $2.4 million under certain senior secured notes previously issued to certain of the Investors by Ocugen) (the “Purchase Price”).",2019-06-28

Thank you for the follow on ST!  :)  I post my thoughts and plays there regularly, as well as recaps to my day Twitter (@born2rock4life) if I close out my positions to show locked in profits and losses.

I can’t say where it will go Monday, but rather that in the near future, likely this week by my reasoning, they will release the news to raise the price up and sell the Ocugen shares (read; dilute.)

Once price is risen up quite a bit, we will see the R/S likely end of day, as it’s slated to happen after the premarket financing but before the merger consummation. The R/S itself won’t devalue the shares, but the dilution, which is why I anticipate this.

Sorry if I’m repeating myself, but just want to be clear as to my intent and speculation. Monday could very well be that day, and given the volume end of day for buys, I’m kind of hoping so.. one will tell",2019-06-28

86,RocketingStocks,esst3tf,/r/pennystocks/comments/c6glkm/simple_questions_june_28_2019/esst3tf/,1,"The main reason is that taking a company public is expensive and time consuming.  The only reason a small company would go public is to get larger investments than the ones that they already have.  Generally speaking, most smaller stocks that go public struggle to stay on the exchange because meeting the exchange demands can be extremely difficult for a smaller company.  

&amp;#x200B;

You open your company up to public scrutiny and SEC oversight.   You will need an underwriter.  Generally a company that will finance your route to IPO.  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan for example can serve as underwriters.  You will need to convince major companies like this to finance your route to success. In return they get their cuts and shares of the IPO.  While not extremely difficult to do, you have to have a successful business already built.  You have to be making extremely decent money, and you have to have some friends in high places.  

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have those things, many then ask the question: Why do I need to go public?   If your company is successful going public with major backing from your underwriters, you and your company will be extremely wealthy.  Most though pay a lot of money, lose a lot to the underwriters and the underwriters pump up the stock and male some money and then leave the company out to dry as they struggle to meet the demands to stay listed.   Many might have been better off staying off the exchanges.",2019-06-28
