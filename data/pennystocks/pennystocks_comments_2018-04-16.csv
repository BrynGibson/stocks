I remember google Timothy Sykes years ago and came across a reddit post on this subreddit and it dissuaded me from seeking the right knowledge when in fact Tim's dvd's, lessons and now this book is solid knowledge and you can easily make a living from it if you follow it to the letter. 

Pennystocks are really unpopular because people who go to school for finance and waste a ridiculous amount of money on these diplomas and degrees are taught that pennystocks are worthless which is correct. They are called pennystocks for a reason but they also volatile which is great to make money.

I actually caught a youtuber, a mainstream trader out of Britain who holds conferences letting people know that these ""Make $3000 in a day"" educational packages like Timothy Sykes dvd's were a scam because that would require a volatile market but that's exactly what pennystocks are. So you have this guy getting hundreds of thousands of views and giving bad information to people who could be making a living on pennystocking while he's trades forex.

I’ve averaged down a lot sense then and am now sitting on 175k shares. My only problem is they talk a lot. Lot of noise. They don’t exactly follow through with a lot of the news they put out. For example, I live in Columbus OH and went to the Arnold the last two years. The first year i couldn’t find them. This year they didn’t actually have a booth either but you could see their sponsored fighter in the octagon for an extra $50. So, in my opinion, they could have taken more advantage of being at the Arnold. My average is around 2.5 cents so I’m not complaining. Im sure they’ll spike to .08 again. They’ve done that 2 or 3 times since I’ve held the stock. I’ll keep holding though. Just wish i could actually buy a product...

I do like CBD companies. $RMHB has some really tasty energy drinks and they just put out their HEMPd line. $CVSI also has great products that i have been using for awhile now. $POTN (avg .07) decent product but their gummies gave me a headache from hell.

158,coltonmusic15,e06iga1,/r/pennystocks/comments/8cs7kk/hmny_is_a_buy_right_now_theyre_going_through_the/e06iga1/,1,Now I'm wondering how far this thing has to fall before a floor is finally in. I'm considering scaling into a small position (maybe 1-3k) and accumulating as it heads lower but that may be a waste of 1-3k lol. It may just continue to fall until the reverse split the shares (dilute dilute). I'll keep an eye I suppose. ,2018-04-16
