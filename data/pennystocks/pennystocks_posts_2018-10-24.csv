0,American Premium Water Corp ($HIPH) - Lalpina Instagram - FAKE FOLLOWERS - What do you think?,9r1d16,DrivenCleats,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9r1d16/american_premium_water_corp_hiph_lalpina/,1,34," First of all, I'd like to start by saying I am a shareholder in American Premium Water Corp. ($HIPH). I own roughly 2,000 shares. But........

I just did an audit on the @lalpinabrands Instagram account (CEO Ryan Fishoff confirmed this was their account in a recent interview), and I didn't find a single follower who wasn't from India. In other words, when people buy fake followers, they are typically Indian accounts.

Another oddity I noticed, was that they had their comments turned off. hmmmm... probably because they didn't want the comment to follower ratio to look skewed.

Thirdly, in July, they had about 800,000 followers and now they have over 1 million?? That is an extremely rapid growth rate for Instagram without any major recent press being released from them, especially when you are comparing them to a company like La Croix and Perrier, who only have 157,000 followers and 29,000 followers on Instagram, respectively.

Something seems fishy about their social media presence. Why be fake on Instagram? It makes me question their ethics as a company as a whole. What do you guys think?",2018-10-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9r1d16/american_premium_water_corp_hiph_lalpina/

## Company Signs Another Client Contract To Host Client's 3,000 Cryptomining Mining Machines; Deal Will Generate Additional $200,000/Month ($2.5 Million/Year) In Hosting Fees To Company

MIAMI, October 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

Mining Power Group, Inc., (the ""Company"" or ""RCGR""), announced today that its majority-owned subsidiary, Northway Mining, LLC, (""Northway"") which offers highly specialized data center hosting services for cryptomining, has signed another 1 year client hosting contract worth $200,000 per month which will yield approximately $2,500,000 million in additional hosting fee revenues to Northway over the next year. ¬†

The Company had previously announced that it had signed a 2-year, $270,000 per month hosting contract with Proof Computing, LLC., a U.S.-based firm which will yield $6,480,000 million in revenues to Northway over the 2 years.

Northway is a cryptocurrency mining hosting facility that provides hosting, electricity, cooling, maintenance, insurance, downtime coverage, OS installation (GPU) assistance, setup &amp; security, and more, including especially low rates for electricity, that reduces client costs and is a major competitive advantage in the marketplace.

[Dror Svorai](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=78930171&amp;privcapId=243963980) President and CEO, stated, ""We are seeing an increased demand from potential clients to utilize our hosting facilities who recognize that we provide a better value in the marketplace with our fully-customized data center cryptomining solutions. We anticipate more hosting deals in the present quarter.""",2018-10-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9r22d3/rcgr_mining_power_group_inc_rcgr_data_center/

[The growing success of the yacht industry](http://nnw.fm/nNX1r) is great news for companies such as [Victory Marine Holdings Corp. (OTC: VMHG)](https://www.networknewswire.com/clients/victory-marine-holdings-corp/?symbol=vmhg). A surge in the global economy has put more money in the hands of the world‚Äôs rich. More people than ever can afford to buy and run a yacht, and many of those individuals are looking for a chance to enjoy their money. In America in particular, a yacht appears to be a symbol of a happy, healthy life among the nation‚Äôs elite.  


Whether made with an eye to a financial investment or a leisure enjoyment, buying a yacht is a complicated business. The purchasing process itself involves a memorandum of understanding, an offer, financing, insurance, survey, sea trial and potential renegotiation based on the results. Knowing what sort of boats are available and when prices will be lowest is invaluable information. Consequently, most buyers go through yacht brokers, specialists who understand the details of these deals and are in demand. Victory Yacht Sales recently [added veteran broker Gary Beaver to its team](http://nnw.fm/XjMG9), bringing his 20 years of experience and large portfolio of yacht listings into the company, according to a Sept. 13 shareholder update.",2018-10-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9r1dy7/vmhg_networknewswire_announces_publication_on/

Nexien BioPharma (OTC QB: NXEN) has 200,000,000 Authorized Shares and 43,880,896 Outstanding. The float, as of October 24, 2018 is 1,499,026. That‚Äôs a very, very small float. As of July 27, 2018, NXEN (formerly NTVA) has a Market Cap of only $16.6 million (at 38¬¢). You can check out OTCmarkets.com for more information.
First, INTIVA BioPharma has a nice management¬†and director line-up:
* Alain Bankier / CEO, Chief Strategist¬†‚Äì If you simply Google his name, you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs been a part of various Cannabis industry events ‚Äî like Canna Tech, Cannabis Learn Conference &amp; Expo, and the Cannabis World Congress &amp; Business Exposition in New York. You can watch/listen to an interview he did with PotBotics. Alan Brochstein from New Cannabis Ventures wrote an article in January 2017 where it started with, ‚ÄúWell-known cannabis investor‚Äù. It goes on to talk about his involvement (co-founder) with New York Angels, which has more than $100 million invested in more than 200 ventures. He‚Äôs the Co-Founder and Managing Director of VS Tech Ventures, which was ‚Äúcreated as an¬†innovative program providing legal cannabis companies access to leading professional service providers, to help entrepreneurs build their businesses, in a cash efficient fashion and to help accelerate company traction, while continually increasing shareholder value‚Äù. Mr. Bankier is also an Advisor to New Frontier Data, whose¬†‚Äúmission is to elevate the discussion around the legal cannabis industry globally by providing unbiased vetted information and educating stakeholders to make informed decisions.‚Äù Mr. Bankier owns more than 2.25 million shares of NTVA, according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Kevin McGovern / Advisor, Director ‚Äì¬†Mr. McGovern was a founder of SoBe Beverages, which most of you should recognize ‚Äî they sold to PepsiCo in 2000 to $370 million. Mr. McGovern is the Chairman &amp; CEO of McGovern Capital, which even lists the Intiva logo on their website under Investments.¬†On the McGovern Capital website it mentions that Kevin has co-founded (through McGovern Capital and its affiliates) more than 25 companies ‚Äî 6 of which have become world/category leaders! ‚ÄúMcGovern Capital, LLC‚Äù owns 751,113 shares of NTVA,¬†according to the S-1 filed/amended on June 19, 2018.
* Lindy Snider / Advisor, Director ‚Äì Ms. Snider is the Founder and CEO of ‚ÄòLindi Skin‚Äô, which is Specialty Skin Care for Cancer Patients. Watch her interview with PotBotics, as she discusses Cannabis investments.¬†Ms. Snider is a dedicated philanthropist and she is an active board member of many non-profit organizations: Fox Chase Cancer Foundation, Cancer Forward, The Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, The Snider Foundation, to name a few. Lindy is the daughter of the late Ed Snider, the owner of the NHL‚Äôs Philadelphia Flyers, who had a net worth of $2.5 billion according to CelebrityNetWorth.com. Ms. Snider is also a Director of Kanativa, a privately-held Canadian corporation which is involved with Alexa‚Äôs Botanicals ‚Äî who has a line of CBD products. Lindy was said to have 440,000 shares as of the S-1 filing.

        Beyond the successful people that are running the show, it‚Äôs important to point out that NTVA¬†does not ‚Äútouch the plant,‚Äù or any derivatives of the plant. They are proceeding with its research and development activities using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) approved protocols, using the synthetic cannabinoid molecules, Dronabinol and Marinol.
NTVA‚Äôs drug development strategy consists of:
* The acute treatment during exposure to organophosphorus nerve agents, including sarin gas. (This could be a big deal for the Middle East, where we hear about ‚ÄòChemical Warfare‚Äò more commonly. Most recently in Syria.)
* The treatment of various symptoms related to myotonic and muscular diseases such as dystrophia diseases.
* The treatment of¬† various symptoms related to lipidosis, which are genetic disorders which are characterized by defects of the digestive system that impair the way the body uses dietary fat.
* The treatment of¬† various symptoms related to lipofuscinosis, in particular neural ceroid lipofuscinosis and macular degeneration associated with lipofuscinosis, which is any disorder associated with the abnormal storage of lipofuscins. Lipofuscins is a yellow to brownish pigment granule found in the muscle, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal, retina and nerve cells undergoing slow regressive changes and accumulating in lysosomes with age.
* The treatment of restless legs syndrome. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) otherwise known as Willis-Ekbom Disease and Wittmaack-Ekbom Syndrome is a term used to describe a neurological sensory disorder that also interferes with sleep and is thus also considered a sleep disorder. RLS may affect up to 8% of the population, according to Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.
* Sexual health affecting both males and females. Male sexual health issues or dysfunction issues include male erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia (inability to achieve orgasm) and desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest in sex). Female sexual health issues or dysfunction issues can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression.
To catch you up to speed on what was announced in the last month:
* On June 28, 2018, NTVA announced it has filed a utility patent application with the US Patent Office ‚Äúrelating to the use of cannabinoids to treat myotonia, myotonic dystrophy and other related dystrophies‚Äù.
* On July 12, 2018, NTVA announced Germany-based Dr. Benedikt Schoser as an Advisor.¬†Dr. Schoser is said to be one of the world‚Äôs top researchers in both molecular mechanisms of muscle loss and myotonic dystrophy.
* On July 19, 2018, NTVA was upgraded to the OTC QB Venture Market, which the company said ‚Äúis a reflection of our ongoing objective to provide additional visibility and credibility to the investment community,¬†as we continue to build INTIVA BioPharma to advance the science of cannabinoid-based and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compliant medicine.‚Äù

Sharing footnotes and resume of my article for interested readers:

&amp;#x200B;

**So how to make money with penny stocks? Putting all together**

So let‚Äôs finish this by laying everything point by point by priorities.

1. Start small by trading demo account or put some hundreds that you can afford to lose into real account. Just don‚Äôt rush into it if you do not have working trading strategy in place and your trading skills are not developed.
2. Learn as much about market you want to trade (in this case learn about micro and nano cap stocks aka penny stocks) and trading in general. Learn learn learn.
3. Practice trading and observe what works for you.
4. Develop or apply known strategy (with the trading edge) which can make you money consistently.
5. Save money and don‚Äôt quit your job too fast. Trading is risky! Remember that!
6. Build your account or add saved money into it.
7. Keep on trading, keep on growing, keep on learning and persevering.
8. Get to the point where you can take out money (don‚Äôt forget to deduct taxes) from your account to cover living expenses and still be able to grow your account. If your goals are different than adjust. In ¬†example maybe you do not want to trade for a living while it is fun side hustle for you that you really enjoy. You get few thousands out of it every month and you just interested to stash it or put it back to work. That is ok. I know many people that add extra money by trading or investing in markets but still not doing this full time. It is as well less stressful. But to live if your goal is to live out of trading please remember you need to grow up to the point where you can take money out to cover your living expenses and still be able to grow account.
9. Make money with penny stocks and enjoy making it:)
