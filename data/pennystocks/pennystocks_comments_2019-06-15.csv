Given the history you laid out, it seems pretty clear they are their to make money for those running the business while destroying shareholder value without regard. 

It is a red flag to see purchase of property/land and sales for a “low price,” that has much higher value at the time it was sold, much less in a couple of years. 

This is a common deception technique, especially in the oil and gas sector, as a means to raise funds from investors speculating on the potential of the land they bought. 

While the stock price runs up, they may likely know what they’ve inherited and cash out at a premium. Company then writes off tons of debt for failed research and exploration, sometimes you’ll see it called impairment charge, and it destroys the Company/Stock value.

While many oil and gas companies run themselves out of funds while truthfully attempting to find their sought resources, its also become a haven for shoddy businessmen looking for a plump paycheck while going down with the ship because they don’t see promise on their properties and ruin the initial investors who funded the company. Most of the times, you’ll see this particularly with acquisition investment companies in the sector.

[One prime example is Torchlight.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PX-ahz2HHBo-ZQpxwdOfYe2Z0jzj8VXG/view) . This PDF shows the breakdown of the company, but to skip particularly to the part regarding how the land valuation ploy works. Skip to page 18 and read under Greg McCabe;

Tl;dr 

The company isn’t up to date on SEC filings and may be delisted. It is my speculation this will most likely be due to an impairment charge as they don’t have any real revenue to purport their stock value. Rather than put out accurate and up to date financials and destroy shareholder value themselves, if the SEC delists after they “tried,” to bring things back into check, then it saves a lot of face and potential lawsuits. Once they are moved to the OTC market, they no longer are subject to the stringent filing requirements of the SEC. 

Without seeing financials, there is no way to know this company is anything more than PR hype. Doesn’t mean you can’t make money on it, but I personally would not take a chance on it as the macro trend and consistently proven reputation of this company reveals its true direction. If they bring financials up to speed, that would be the only way I would consider touching them. A company facing delisting due to being behind on filings is the last thing any company wants when looking for a shell company(reverse merger,) that’s listed on the stock market, as it can be a money pit with all the necessary requirements to bring it into spec, and the SEC is less likely to approve given the history. So the prospect of a buyer is probably nil as well until they’re current on filings. Best of luck in your investments.",2019-06-15

2,tmh0312,er9ghvo,/r/pennystocks/comments/c0rcbd/atis_attis_industries_worth_a_look/er9ghvo/,1,What I don't understand in this story is what Sunoco is gaining by helping Attis and Greenshift if everything is truly smoke and mirrors. It's truly confused the hell out of me and why I think there might actually be something here.,2019-06-15
3,born2rock4life,er9qc8n,/r/pennystocks/comments/c0rcbd/atis_attis_industries_worth_a_look/er9qc8n/,1,"Me too. I would imagine it is either a potential asset purchase (patent maybe?) in exchange for the plant and 10 years of offloading. I haven’t found what the assets were yet myself, but am busy right now so I’ll try to look later. 

The company should be reporting financials if they were doing well you would imagine. Which is why I can almost assure they’re not looking good. No company has any reason to twice delay financials without fear of what it may do and/or already in a very tight budget.


The Sunoco news is reputable coming from them directly, but I don’t have much else to go on that would be hard info without financials. Companies hire PR firms to fluff all the time, and it’s low volume and market cap make it risky for larger positions due to illiquidity and slippage. 

Hopefully this is a turnaround for the company after realizing they needed a buoy to keep things afloat revenue wise for their debts and grim looking future if it’s not corrected. 

Unfortunately the statistics show most companies fail and with it being a nano-cap stock, it’s anybody’s guess what happens from here, but most likely it’s not positive if history rhymes with itself.  

They’ve reached a high of $7.44 during their opening week after becoming ATIS (May 2018,), and since then the price has fallen 75% in just a years time.  That to me reminds me of companies like AMR, TRCH, etc. that all are all investment/acquisition firm companies who pivot from one company to another shell IPO and have a consistent pattern like this or worse. Hopefully that’s not the case.",2019-06-15
4,tmh0312,er9t36u,/r/pennystocks/comments/c0rcbd/atis_attis_industries_worth_a_look/er9t36u/,1," Just found out that Sunoco originally bought the Fulton facility for $8.5m in a bankruptcy case. So selling it for $20m is a solid gain but why not go for full appraisal price if that's really what it's worth? Maybe the patents are legit.

I'll just keep posting finds here, it's a good way to consolidate info and get input on it. Appreciated the responses.
