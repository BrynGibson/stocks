$MYO, also undervalued, great entry at 3.70 to 3.80 right now, ER in March more than likely, could run up alot, as they ramped up their sales, paid some debt and are looking solid. 

$CERC, another biotech that is in the black, has cash on hand for all their expenses, already popped back near 4$, watch for a red day or two to re enter imo. 

$MTBC, hovering around 4$, building support, ER coming up that should show alot of growth, should run to 5$ soon. 

$CHFS, low float, easy to swing and day trade, not a solid company, but trades from 3 to 3.50 pretty regularly, and can spike very high any time it gets volume, any time you see it drop significantly, you can swing overnight for a nice gain. 

Just be smart and do your DD. Don’t trade through ERs and events, trade the run up to the day of and sell before. 

Don’t swing trade just to swing trade (a habit I had to break). Only swing when you really see the potential, ER runups, conference run ups are easy 1 to 2 week plays where you can minimize risk and cash in decent. ",2018-02-22
