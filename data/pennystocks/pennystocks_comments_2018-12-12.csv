Funny how that contradicts your original statement.

It depends on the area. Most are under that price but there are multiple listings above 1.5 million. Nobody wants to operate a large farm out of Tomahawk, WI. Somewhere closer to Milwaukee or Madison makes logistics and employment much easier but you pay a higher price for the property.",2018-12-12
