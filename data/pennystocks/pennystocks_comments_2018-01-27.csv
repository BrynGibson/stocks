For US firms it's a different story. Under this current administration there is always the danger they'll bring the house down as part of their disruptive nature. This isn't political bias, hear me out... Trump is purposefully undoing anything Obama touched or has a connection with. ACA, cutting Yellen, Dodd-Frank, etc. Well under Obama the weed industry in America flourished, and the atmosphere of ""we won't infringe on states"" allowed colorado and others to slowly roll out rec weed. Well, despite all the positives that brought, Trump doesn't give a fuck. Sessions might seem dated now, but his stance is shared with other prominant GOP and law enforcement officials. I'm not saying it will happen for sure, but look at the course of events that have unfolded since 2016 ended. Systemically, a shaking of institutions, anything that Obama left a mark on.

Arguably the mecca of weed in Canada, and the largest urban center that isn't a government capital, so it's sorta the wild west of weed right now. I am going to hate it when they switch to Shoppers and Liquor Boards, because I much prefer going across the street to get it, literally anywhere in the city. Canada wide won't adopt that though, it will be almost entirely controlled distribution points (i.e. Shoppers, LCBO, etc.), not because of some effort to catalog it all, but because that's how our economy has always worked, bigger firms cozy up and get the government to ordain them some artificial monopoly/oligopoly in their sector. E.g., telecomms, airlines, utilities, alcohol/tobacco, gambling, natural resources, etc. Weed will be no different, a handful of firms get sweetheart treatment. One good example is Canadian tech, for firms that reach Blackberry status you get government guidance regardless of the private/public aspects of the company. 

But real talk. Even though Ottawa is a sleepy government city in many ways, nothing beats smoking weed on parliament hill. In terms of places in Canada where you can do that.

Look at gay marriage, something recently decriminalized at the federal level with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in U.S. v. Windsor, a landmark case fundamentally fought for the recognition of gay marriage by the fed/IRS. A fundamental right, in the modern era. Yet that didn't stop the government from criminalizing it after a few states had legalized it, even in the 2000s, people in Cali thought their state was so liberal, and businesses popped up to cater to that market, money was to be made off gay marriage, and then the gov stepped in and shut it all down for a while because the atmosphere changed with the administration. Cali is one of the largest economies in the world, and has a population equal to Canada's, and that didn't stop the administration at the time from pulling the plug. 

Remember that in the 2000s the federal gov actively pursued mj distributors in states that were lax on weed laws. Cali tried to decriminalize medicinal before, and the feds ran in to shut it down. When Obama was head of state, he sent a memo to federal prosecutors asking them to stop going after medicinal mj distributors, and that's what opened the door for all of this, fundamentally. My hypothesis for the US is based on a few factors, but one of them is ""don't bet against Trump"" because despite my own personal bias he hasn't lost, at anything. Think about it, no matter how staggering the odds against him, and despite the poor tastes/logic, he still has managed to do almost everything he said he would. And most of those things involves undoing anything Obama touched, anything his legacy was built around. DACA, ACA, mmj, de-escalating military involvement in the middle east, russian sanctions, environmental protection, etc. You can bank on him touching mj because Obama was the first ""mj President,"" he's the first to sidestep the ""did you smoke mj"" question that always pops up in the primaries, unlike the 90s-era socially liberal Clinton who said he ""didn't inhale,"" Obama said ""I thought that was the point.""

He’s not against it, Sessions is. The N.J. governor also said that he will legalize mj, so the government hasn’t done anything to shut it down yet. Additionally, Colorado votes next month to legalize it and the voting body said it’s all but guaranteed. What was once a hard stance has softened as the medicinal benefits of mj have become more well known. I don’t smoke it but I know how helpful it can be in helping to combat a number of illnesses. I think Trump will allow it to flourish as it’ll help offset the US deficit and help to create new jobs and bolster the economy.
