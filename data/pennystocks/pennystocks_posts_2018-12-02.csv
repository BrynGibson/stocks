0,Are you looking for a unicorn?,a2gzgm,bighdaddie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a2gzgm/are_you_looking_for_a_unicorn/,6,26,"We are all looking for a unicorn. Something that doesn't exist. A company with great patents, technology, disruptive technology that can totally change an industry and yet totally undiscovered by the investment community and at a price that 5 years from now people will be shocked how cheap you own it. Unicorns don't exist, but this company does. The industry is health care and stem cells are going to totally change that industry over the next 5 years. Up until a year ago the FDA didn't even know if they could regulate stem cells. Now stem cells are starting to show up in all kind of treatments, orthopedic, heart, autoimmune and on and on. The company that I am talking about has patents on the collection, transportation, storage and reproduction of stem cells. No matter what the treatment, no matter who the provider, they will make money based on those patents and services provided. 

American Cryostem (CRYO) is almost totally unknown in the investment world. The stock can sometimes go days without trading, then trade hundreds of thousands at other times. 18 months ago it was at $.30 then went to over $1 in a few months, then got hammered after the FDA sent a letter warning about the new guidelines and to stop production until  meeting the guidelines. They did stop production and now that they have met all the guidelines will restart as soon as they FDA approves their IND trail which will be filed imminently.

The stock is cheap for 2 reasons; the FDA letter and lack of capital. The lack of capital is being resolved  by a wealthy shareholder putting in $2 million to fund the FDA trail and have sufficient working capital to expand production. CRYO is filing a new ""drug"" trial with the FDA this month. The drug is actually a persons own stem cells, now called a drug by the FDA, and is treatment for concussion. Currently the only treatment for concussion is rest in bed. CRYO has completed animal studies using stem cells for concussion and the results are stellar; 90% had total success, 10% partial success and no side effects. They plan to file a phase I IND by year [end. As](https://end.As) soon as they do their lab is approved to start producing and selling stem cells for orthopedic use. As soon as this news comes out I expect this stock to jump. Because of low volume it only takes a little buying to move it fast. 

It will be 6 months before they can start treating humans for concussion. So far 2 groups have lined up for treatment; the NFL players association and the Department of Defense. 5 years from now the concussion business alone could be hundreds of millions per pear. Plus the service business from other providers, Plus their patented growth media sales. Plus their international business from Japan, China, Thailand and Mexico. Plus their stem cell in cosmetics skin rejuvenation business. Plus owning 5% of their Chinese partner who is going public at $200 million in Hong Kong in 2019.

This is not a trade. I am looking for a minimum of a 20 to 1 return in the next 5 years. Personally, I am staying until the eventual buyout.",2018-12-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a2gzgm/are_you_looking_for_a_unicorn/
