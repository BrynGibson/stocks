1,GDET Ready To Explode,audzf8,miamidd12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/audzf8/gdet_ready_to_explode/,2,0,[removed],2019-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/audzf8/gdet_ready_to_explode/
2,Friendable FDBL - NEWS 2/24/2019 - Email and new offerings...Q's,audcog,Legend_of_Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/audcog/friendable_fdbl_news_2242019_email_and_new/,2,2,"$FDBL

We need to talk about Friendable. I am new to the stock market and my first ever buy was $100.00 of FDBL at 0.0001. Then I learned about reverse stock splits and well, at least its only $100.00. Since then I have day traded a few stocks and am back to my original account deposit, meaning I basically have 1 million free shares of FDBL just sitting there... 

...But today I received an email sent from Friendable to investors and a link in regards to an updated offering involving dividends. The link is here: [http://offering.fanpasslive.com/friendable-crowdfund-offering](http://offering.fanpasslive.com/friendable-crowdfund-offering/). Scroll down to the investment and rev share portion.   


I'm assuming this to mean that friendable is looking for people to crowdfund it and through that, people will receive stocks valued at .25 cents a share. **Are these stocks different from the ones I already own?** 

Assuming FDBL does a 1:100 split, i'd end up with 10,000 shares at a new price of 0.01 each. But to get to 25 cents.. FDBL would have to do a split of 1:2500, leaving me with 400 shares. I'm assuming the split would need to reflect the value of the share value being offered through the crowdfunding, unless it is going to be a completely separate stock ticker. ***Please let me know what you think.*** 

  
The email I received is as follows:

Feel free to share with Mr. Market or those interested in the TRUTH

Chuck Gillman &amp; his Cabal of HF Jeff Eberwein, Whitney Tilson, John Climaco, Ben Large, Dilip Singh (they own at least 5% + 3,666,666 RSU via 3 Board designates) &amp; Barry Igdaloff owns 9.3 M NOVC common per 14A + est 1.7M RSU priced at 3 cts (Board at DX &amp; NOVC), Howard Amster 4M common + est 1.7M RSU priced at 3 cts (DX big investor &amp; NOVC Board member), Thomas Akin/Talkot Capital Sausalito, CA owns 5% max allowed per NOVC poison pill ex DX COB/CEO, largest investor in NOVC, IMH &amp; DX theses investors all know each other and take control of **Novation Co Inc. OTCBB/NOVC 3cts** w/ Big Brothers; Mass Mutual &amp; sub Barings own 20% of common per proxy 14A at price 2.33/share + Fortress owns 67% of Sr Debt which they paid nothing to own via CDO Service Rights. Fortress &amp; these DX investors have proven relationship with Fortress Wesley Edens which owned 100% of Capstead Mortgage CMO 2000-2003 when these investos oused Tom Potts, ex CEO of DX took share price of DX from pennies to 7. Today DX pays 75 cts dividend on just common.

NOVC has GAAP concealed $700M **NOL** &amp; $307M Unrealized Tax Capital Losses (14A proposal #3 extends poison pill to protect NOL from IRC 382) + Cleanup Call Rights on $3B portfolio Profitable/Seasoned nonprime mortgage loans\*, per Service Rights Transfer Agreement sec 5.04 (attached to the back 2007 10Q Q3) + Healthcare Staffing (est $60M Rev w/ 6% EBITDA), NovaStar Financial Inc. (only brand in subprime aka nonprime mortgage space other then NationStar NSM which was recently sold for $3.8B by Fortress (owned 68% of NSM) months ago to COOP, WMIH, WaMu $7B NOL. KKR owns 17% of COOP (holds $7B NOL) common. (Wesley Edens, COB &amp; his Partner Peter Briger, Head of Credit; Edens ran MBS Desk at both Lehman Bros, Blackrock and Briger ran Special Situations unit at Goldman Sachs with Mark McGoldrick (WSJ named McGoldrick ""Goldfinger"" because of all the money Goldman Sachs paid him) now at Fortress via Mount Kellett). Fortress also sold months ago their 40% ownership in One Main OMF (ex subprime lender at CitiBank and AIG Subprime car/personal loans only) for $2B to Apollo Global Mgt. 

So why is Fortress holding 67% of NOVC Sr Debt since 2010. Odd given Wesley Edens has a proven relationship with Barry Igdaloff and his band of investors at Dynex Capital. DX investors own 30% of NOVC common stock max allowed per Poison Pill extended in 14A Proxy. Fortress paid nothing for 86M Face Value of NOVC Sr Debt. 

What is the real plan of these related/powerful investors for NOVC that has been conceal from Mr. Market? See page 11-15 of the Proxy proposal #3 which calls for 500M common rights (dividends and votes aka control) to be issued (via PS Series F) at price of $2.33 per share = $1.1.65B. 2.33 is exactly the cost basis of MM Barings. Once PS Ser F is issued watch Fortress &amp; Mass Mutual Barings take the lead and retire Sr Debt at discount. NRZ New Residential Investment Corp is very interested in NOVC Call Rights &amp; submitted Economics to NOVC CEO in Dec. NOVC could sell the conceal Call Rights for as much as 200M &amp; pay these investors a Special one time dividend giving these investors all of their cash back leaving them owning millions of NOVC common or common rights (per PS Ser F). NOVC would look at a SPAC special purpose acquisition corp aka Blank Check corp with billion worth of GAAP hidden tax benefits, no debt, and billion cash to acquire EBITDAs Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Mark McGoldrick, Thomas Finke, CEO of Barings, Thomas Akin (ex Head of Merrill Lynch West Coast) have all lined up creating EPS, Taxable Income &amp; Capital Gains ALL TAX FREE.",2019-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/au9b40/otcbbnovc_3_cts_status_today_feel_free_to_share/
