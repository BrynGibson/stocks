Someone with $1000 in savings would pay attention to a $20 gain but not nearly as much

Someone with $100,000 in savings wouldn’t think twice about a $20 return. 

So yeah, it takes money to get large returns, but people with huge amounts of money aren’t as worried about their profits. 

And by that I mean, if you saw someone with a $10,000 gain on something you’d (or I would at least) probably think “Dang that’s great!!”, but if that person has 3 million in their brokerage account that might as well be $20 to the paycheck to paycheck person
