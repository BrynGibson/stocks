0. Find a stock

1. Buy 100,000 shares @ 0.01$ each. So $10K total.

2. Shill it. 

3. Sell it.

4. Repeat.

I've read some stuff like [this](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/risks-trading-lowvolume-stocks.asp). So I have a general idea. My questions are, 

1) Can I pick any stock that have lower volume than $10K/day on average? I don't want it to be too high because then I can't have control over the price. I don't want it to be too low because then I can't sell or buy without causing myself a loss.

2) If it turns out someone distributed false info about the stock, will SEC find me even if they cannot prove my connection to the false info? After all I profited from this so I must be the actor behind the shill, in their opinion.

3) Any other tips? I am new to trading but this doesn't seem like a rocket science. Buy cheap, shill well, sell high, repeat",2020-03-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbsnun/how_to_find_a_good_stock_for_me_to_buy_hold_and/

6,Stock Trading Journey - Week 1,fbosiz,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbosiz/stock_trading_journey_week_1/,1,0,"So as a refresher if you didn't catch my post last weekend. I have doubled my stock trading account the last two years and wanted to document my trades and journey for year three, starting with 21.3k this week, I want to see what I can turn that into this year. If you want to read that post in more detail you can do so here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting\_stock\_trading\_journey\_2020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting_stock_trading_journey_2020/) 

So this past week for those following was absolutely wild. The market saw some of its biggest drops in history! SPY saw some massive daily drops throughout the week and the market was very bloody just about everyday. However, I ended the week up $465! I will say I took a couple losses that were bigger than I anticipated due to the massive market drops but very happy I came out of this week in the positive.

I haven't really decided how I want to document this, whether I want to post weekly or monthly updates. I guess I will figure that out as I go. But I did want to at least provide a week 1 update after my original post.

Going into this past week I was only holding CORV at $0.30. This stock had done a decent job at holding that level and it went on a huge run this week. This stock ran up over $0.60 and saw over 100% increase from my entry level. Unfortunately I did not capture gains very well on this trade. The market performing so poorly really made me gun shy to hold out on some of these trades I normally would. I sold this one at $0.32 for 5% gains and $225 proft.

On Monday this week I bought KMPH, VEON and BIOC. KMPH and VEON had seen big drops back to prior support levels. Unfortunately, with those stocks having steep drops recently combined with the market having massive drops both those stocks continued their free fall and blew through support levels so I had to cut both KMPH and VEON. KMPH I took a pretty sizeable 15% loss - $750 and VEON I took a 6% loss - $300.

At this point I was down about $800 on the week which obviously wasn't ideal but I was fairly happy with not losing a unreasonable amount due to the market turmoil that was going to make it hard for me to recoup. $800 was a fairly easy amount for me to get back. Also I have traded BIOC 3-4 times in the past and I have always had a great feel for this stock and felt confident in its next move. It also hadn't really dropped much with the market. I got the pop I was looking for in BIOC on Friday and sold it at $0.40 for 29% gains - $1250 profit. Although BIOC similar to CORV ran for over 100% gains.

I will say I am kind of disappointed in myself for cutting CORV and BIOC so early. I really could have capitalized on those and profited over $5,000. I let the overall market sentiment affect my judgement and strategy on getting the most I could out of the winners. On both of those winners if I had set stop losses 2% below where I sold them and then incrementally moved up my stop loss as the stock continued to rise I could have maximized my gains much better, I also could have used a trailing stop on these and that would have played out well also.

Anyway, overall I am very happy with being in the green this week after seeing how the rest of the market experienced one of its worst weeks of all time. I post my trades and charts and discuss things a little more in depth on my twitter account if you want to check it out, give me a follow or validate the information above:  [https://twitter.com/TheBreadMakerr](https://twitter.com/TheBreadMakerr)  Hope you enjoyed the breakdowns.

Of course, I am watching CODX IBIO APT... BUT there are a ton of other opporunities out there besides these crowded names. Here's a few ideas you can make money on:

** TRIL ** Closed strong over $5.00 w/ the daily chart breakout - one to watch Monday/Tuesday (if Monday is used as consolidation) -- watch over $5.50 w/ volume to push back towards highs and over $6

** TRIB ** CV play idea, CO is profitable and chart looks nice. Needs to hold trend over $1.20 in  the coming days and push over $1.80 with volume to get started with a big move. $2.00 is a key level over $1.80. 

** CBAY ** Moving averages lining up nicely on the daily for this one. Could be  a nice swing off the bottom key support off $1.55 area and push up to break $1.80s, then $2.00. One to keep on watch, it moves a bit slower so set a few price alerts and leave it! There's a large gap to fill over $2.20 which has worked well in the market lately.

** BIOC** Traded record volume on Friday and closed up 168% -- I'll be watching this one for continuation Monday morning off the key level of $0.60, we need to see a gap hold above that level and form higher lows towards the $1.00 level for the best case scenario breakout run.

** SPCE** Everyone has had their eyes on this one and it has pulled back hard since that $40 blowoff move. Watching this week for a bounce, as we are teetering over a key support level at $20.00 with likely a few short covering coming in. Not a bad R/R here towards $30 area.

** OGEN** Long this one on Friday @ $0.62. Gearing up on the daily chart towards the psychological level of $1.00. Expecting P2 data soon, so that's why we are seeing this volume come in - plus the sub $1 theme is hitting since Thursday/Friday. I'd like to see a gap up Monday morning and shove over $1.00 with volume for a nice run.

**NH** Breaking out on the daily chart with a positive reaction to ER on Friday. Technically speaking this stock looks great over the $2.50 level for a run towards the $3.00 area. I'd like to see it continue to hold above $2.00 on dips to show a sign of strength.",2020-03-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbn45z/ultimate_watchlist_for_next_week/

Dr. Jack Regan, LexaGene’s CEO and founder, says the company’s genetic analyzer can detect new pathogens such as the coronavirus in “just one hour, on-site”.

“Currently the traditional process requires that samples from sick individuals must be transported to laboratories for manual processing,” Regan said. “This is extremely inefficient and introduces a significant time-delay that can have severe consequences for disease spread. Today’s coronavirus outbreak highlights why LexaGene’s technology is needed so desperately.”

“Currently, no technology exists that allows for these locations to readily start screening for a new threat within days of an outbreak being identified,” Regan continued. **“LexaGene is addressing this urgent problem and has developed the first ever, easy-to-use, open-access diagnostic analyzer that is designed to help control the spread of deadly outbreaks such as this 2019 coronavirus.”**

“With a traditional reference lab, by the time a clinic takes a sample and ships it off, you’ve lost 12 to 24 hours,” said Dr. Jack Regan, the chief executive of LexaGene, a Massachusetts company that hopes to sell its coffee maker-size instrument to airports, schools and clinics. “We can get results in under an hour, which makes a huge difference during deadly outbreaks.” 

"" A wider rollout of these tests faces a number of hurdles. Most of the tests identify a patient’s infection 80 to 90 percent of the time — regulators would like that figure to be closer to 100 percent — and many of them are still awaiting a green light from the F.D.A. But health experts say a larger impediment to their widespread use is economics: **Most of the tests run $500 to $3,000** (the test used to diagnose Mr. Springer was $2,000) and because few private insurances companies cover them, the costs are largely borne by hospitals or patients.
