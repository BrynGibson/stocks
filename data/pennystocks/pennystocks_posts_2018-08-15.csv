*Epazz reported operational income of over $628,000 unaudited for 2017 &amp; revenue of $474,145 unaudited, for the 1st quarter of 2018*

[CHICAGO, IL, Aug. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epazz, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K672qdy3Dy_6ZdDO9OIuS73CJyhkYnr-14_BXRQmRA-6ex0E1SH-Jou4wqA_LJrGLq6dP5qnZ80tew4J4MGM_sCLAcHHX6FrleghMFVBIvFXPCzgxKkFB9ST7I4jg923x8-8sSnnD0SVsQWYvFzJbg==). ([EPAZ](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epaz)), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced that the company filed a provisional patent for blockchain energy consumption management technology for use in Bitcoin data centers. The company will use its EnergyVIEW solution in wastewater treatment facilities to save on the energy consumption in data centers used to mine Bitcoin. EnergyVIEW is an important automation component of integrated plant management and control systems. 

EnergyVIEW provides real-time energy consumption data for plant managers. This same technology can be used for data centers that mine Bitcoin and other complex computing activities, such as high frequency trading. Data centers demand an increasing use of energy, similar to water and wastewater facilities. EnergyVIEW technology can provide a way to decrease the energy cost for data centers. 

According to [Forbes](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3KJcqnlaZ9cvqKnn9OrGIwaDd21qWxb2uDimBrcLt6811c0AwM227y9Qx-bfRKTSkjXOnPKR3ZWPJrb_weVnIWuTQvL_vqHTsJ0Ckhmc4X7l9YWU5hSSzQrRfXPLh4PHEB-J4rhIksr0XMG-EQMyvAwnk97dqUKV_pqUmguRKuBCLXs-WvHhK7n0omJ7rWBvzJMLJrGZe64Pq2jyFLHgtWYwKmYDGIgkgZtUEKyKXy6puG86MMIZ49XOQkXJjjhr), “Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption is 61.4 TWh, which is also equivalent to 1.5% of the electricity consumed in the United States.” Additionally, [Joule’s new study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gkf_9gC_7xWcP3zHy0mZ4Jjd-mPwRTSu42_bpRKGxlb9kfi7RHVciEoiZgM7aQcuPhiLC7aCSsGisNTEjjEXwwRZVfdV4eEV1bWTtspUrC62aME0_jzovJjzZvF9kx-nX6tHAixrC885x1YwEOdl-A==) estimates that mining for Bitcoin consumes at least 2.6 GW of power, equivalent to what Ireland consumes in electricity yearly. This figure could rise to 7.7 GW in early 2019, which would account for close to half a percent of the world’s electricity consumption. According to the Crescent Electric Supply Company, the estimated electricity can “cost between $3,224 to $9,000 to mine a single Bitcoin.”

The company is taking the technology from EnergyVIEW and adopting it and enhancing it for special use in Bitcoin mining to reduce the cost of energy consumption. From the filed patent, the blockchain energy consumption management technology will monitor the energy used in the data center and provide users with information they need to analyze the energy usage. Then, the data center can take steps toward better energy usage to increase efficiency and reduce energy costs. Once the technology is converted for this growing multibillion-dollar market, the company will begin to market the solution for an annual license fee. 

Some of the features in development for the Bitcoin data center include tracking historical data. The current usage is helpful, but historical data can give you a larger picture of your energy use. The data center usually has peak demand times and tracking these times provides an opportunity to reduce energy costs. Energy theft is a serious problem for many shared data centers. The power meter monitors energy use patterns and changes in the patterns. The patent covers ways to detect theft and short-circuit it.

“There are many vertical markets that can use our EnergyVIEW solution to reduce energy costs. We believe that Bitcoin data centers are a major opportunity to apply our technology,” said Shaun Passley, Ph.D., CEO of Epazz, Inc.

I've only figured out that I can act as my own agent and contact the transfer agent if I sell some to random people. Short of standing on street corners and asking if anyone wants to buy my stock (""hey man, you wanna buy some stock?""), how do I turn this vapor equity in to some fiat?

The company uses a metal alloying process called Kryron for the uniform dispersion of carbon nanotubes in metal. Its products are used in various industries, including ballistic armor, electrical, aviation, automotive, mining, medical devices, agriculture and heavy equipment, consumer electronics, and others.

For years, there has been talk that a reverse merger might breathe life back into this idle stock causing a turn around for the company. Private companies in the ballistic armor business have been rumored to be potential candidates for a reverse merger. If it were to happen, the stock could move from its current $0.0025 per share to prior highs of $5 or more.

BORK may continue to idle and go nowhere, but the occasional spike in price (up 66% today) and volume may be a sign of continued rumors of a reverse merger brewing.",2018-08-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/97manu/bourque_industries_inc_bork_up_66_today/
