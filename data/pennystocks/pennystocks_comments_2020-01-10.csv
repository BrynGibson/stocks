Put = down / bear boy

I think X company will go up, but only have $1000. X is trading at $100, call contracts are $10*100=all my money. 

Why*100? Well cause I need pay for all the shares on the contract. 1 contract = 100 shares. 

So I buy my call, and it has an expiration date. But who cares, X went up to 150 the next day, I‚Äôm out!!! So I do magic with the Wall Street and sell. Everyone on rWSB is dick riding X today, so calls were $50and*100, cool I have $5000 now.

36,kkyea,fdqddb7,/r/pennystocks/comments/emjta6/simplify/fdqddb7/,1,"How I know it. Call means going up.  Put means going down. Think of it as gambling!  Like race horse or dog racing. The stock is currently at a price. The gamble is what the stock needs to pass ( call means ho above and put means go below ).  Then there is the price that you actually play to take the gamble. Let's say there is a stock currently at $20. You see the option call for $21.  The price to gamble on that option is listed at $.05.  Since each option contract is 100 shares, that means you have to pay $.05 for each share.  So a total of $5.  

If this hypothetical scenario is a call. Then you hope the stock price goes up. How much?  At least up to your break even point, which is where you dont win or lose, just made your money back.  What is the break even?  It's the option price (21) plus the cost to play (.05)  so your break even is 21.05.  Let's say you are a little lucky, and the stock price goes up to 21.06.  Congratulations you just made 1 dollar. Since the option deals with 100 shares, that 1 cent above the break even is times 100.  So 1 dollar. Let's say you got more lucky, and it went to $22, that's .95 above the break even. So you just made $95.  If you are unlucky and the stock doesn't even meet the break even, you lost based on it. So final price is $21.04, you just lost a dollar. Let's say you got even more unlucky and the stock didnt even rise to $21, then you failed your gamble and lose all the money you put it ($5).  

Same goes for puts but opposite. Every cent below the break even is worth a dollar.

Of course that is just one contract.  Let's sat you bought 100 contracts.  Go back to the call option scenario. That 1 dollar gain would be 100 dollars. That 95 dollar gain would be 9500.  

Options are tricky and you have to be ready to cash out with some gains rather than negative gains.
