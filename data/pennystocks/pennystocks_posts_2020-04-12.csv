Strong bullish movement over the past week pushed to 2.45 Thursday. It's a juicy looking dip, but volatility has me scared to pull the trigger Monday. Anyone have better clarity on this than I?

I've been looking at this sub and the Robinhood sub for a couple weeks now and was wondering why I don't see more discussion on Reddit about stocks like the ones listed above that have dividends such as 70.18 and 41.88, and were consistent prices looking at the 5-year before the crash with plenty of potential to rise back up.

Aren't these the type of stocks that could give you the most bang for your buck if you invest while they're low and then just hang on once they're at pre-crash levels? Or is there something I'm overlooking as a complete beginner?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or commentary on the subject.",2020-04-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fzxkqd/noob_questiondd_why_doesnt_there_seem_to_be_more/

Coronavirus is more likely to attack older people. 

These people need medication (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc). 

Going to a pharmacy now is more dangerous than ever. 

Medication cannot be openly sold through e-commerce BUT it can be sold online with the right tools.
