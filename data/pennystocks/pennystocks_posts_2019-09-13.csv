Watched and heard a nice bit about Tim. Just wondering if anyone pays the subscription to be part of his challenge and is it worth it. Or is there better free content I could be exploring.

Thanks!",2019-09-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d3hkvc/timothy_sykes_challenge/

3,Tim Sykes is the MAN,d3jogj,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d3jogj/tim_sykes_is_the_man/,1,2,"It’s recommended to watch the trading courses as they explain Tim’s trading style in great detail. It will be easier to understand Tim’s alerts and chat room comments if you have familiarized yourself with his basic methodology.

Tim also provides video lessons in which he goes over recent trades. The videos are released weekly and stored in a video lesson library that has over 4,400 videos. It’s impossible to watch them all, but it can be helpful to search by ticker or strategy if you are trying to brush up on your trading knowledge.

Tim is a strong advocate of trading education. He was one of the first traders to start providing online courses, later followed by traders like Nathan Michaud and Cameron Fous. Tim constantly encourages his students and followers to **study**! 

Ignore some people on these subreddits that say he's a ""scam."" They say that because THEY ARE SCAMS. The ones that call out Trustworthy Tim are scam artists themselves. Trustworthy Tim wanted to put a STOP to these fake gurus, and change the industry. He's a masterful teacher, and should be more well respected on this forum.",2019-09-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d3jogj/tim_sykes_is_the_man/

Its at $0.0027 right now. 

Asked CEO if their september news was going to be big enough to push it over $0.01 - reply apparently was kinda laughing, like ""umm, yes easy"".
