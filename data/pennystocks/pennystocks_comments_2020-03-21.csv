1,Mittens1987,fl2k9ih,/r/pennystocks/comments/fm6krf/aytu_odd/fl2k9ih/,1,"I know they claim that, I'm just wondering why the reporter (im assuming Rob Low) said there is 100k test kits on the Denver airport tarmac at that moment.  So one of them is definitely lying, the reporter for sure, but the CEO we don't know for sure yet.  I got pissed off and sold right away in after hours.  Don't trust it enough.  Why would a reporter have an interest in lying about the kits being there?",2020-03-21
2,ImBadAtThis20,fl2keld,/r/pennystocks/comments/fm6krf/aytu_odd/fl2keld/,1,"I think they were just stalling, and I don’t think they are currently in the airport I think they said they are shipping delivering them to the airport this weekend and will be ready next week.

Almost 100m market cap already, BLPH is not even at that after their 400% run today.  Aytu I think is thinking about the future and willl probably do more offerings, they are thinking long term and won't be a quick buck to be made at this point.  The problem is the corona virus might give them a year or two of good revenues, but not enough to make them more than a 100m dollar company that they are now.  I don't short stocks or buy puts, I might even buy back if it turns out to be legit, but for now I'm pulling money out.",2020-03-21

5,dp79,fl2l9qi,/r/pennystocks/comments/fm6krf/aytu_odd/fl2l9qi/,3,"I think you’re reading too much into this honestly. The reporter was just implying to the governor in the press conference that the kits are right at the doorstep. He exaggerated a bit. They’re coming next week. 

The CEO actually has been pretty consistent with the test kits coming next week as well. When the reporter asked him last Friday (this was the first video interview), the CEO said it would be here in a week or two. Hence, why the reporter chose to use the shorter timeframe in implying they’re practically here. 

In fact, there’s a website that tracks imports/exports, and it showed that the manufacturer has brought massive amounts of cargo to the shipping location in China with the destination port being California. 

As for the offerings, they’re a small company. They needed the cash to purchase the tests, and it helps them be a lot more flexible in ordering larger quantities in advance. 

These weren’t public offerings. They were direct offerings to institutional investors. That’s a big difference. It’s actually seen as a fairly bullish move because it means these big investors believe in the company and where it’s headed. Obviously three in 2 weeks are a bit much, but I think they were pretty overwhelmed by the response and needed the cash to commit to orders. 

Finally, the Senator of Colorado himself is pushing for this.",2020-03-21

- Gold is historically quite expensive right now, but gold mining stocks are cheap relative to earnings. Too cheap.

- We are headed toward a recession and I expect a low US dollar, which will boost the price of gold.

- Actual physical gold is apparently in short supply right now, virtually impossible to buy in large quantities.

No shit you can’t lose $ if you sell Itm.

And no, I’m playing the, I fucking pray it goes up or I’m fucked game.

Also, stocks are really gay, options for stocks are where the real $ is at. That is where low volume price swings on volatility come into play. For example: a contract option call for $4 is purchased when stock ABC is at $275. 5 hours later stock ABC is at $274 now but the options price stayed the same because of volatility et cetera.

When a stock goes down and ur either shorting/longing, you are losing money. Fax. The same is not the case of options, which is what your original comment should have been geared toward.

Every time I go to Vegas (which isn’t all that many times lol) I walk up to the roulette tables look for one that’s hit either red OR black about 7-8 times in a row. If it’s been red 8 times in a row I put money on black. If I hit I just won double my money. In fact that’s the point of this “strategy” that it ALWAYS* pays double its initial investment. Because if I didn’t hit that’s first play, I just put down double the original. If that doesn’t hit, double again, and basically you just continue to double until you hit. It’s relying on the fact that sooner or later black HAS to hit. There’s no way red can hit forever, just won’t happen 47 times in a row lol. This removes ALL strategy. Whatever you start with gets doubled... EXCEPT... if you run out of money or hit the table’s betting limit, then you are screwed and lose exponentially everything you put in. If red hits 4 more times you will have lost your seed money and it doubled 3 times.

The point of my post is to ask, how much of your strategy do you feel is this this automatic? Do you actually research what the company does and why it might go up or down? Or is it just looking at numbers that fall into the sweet spot and placing your bet... like Vegas.",2020-03-21

If you flip it 100 times in a row and it’s been heads 99 straight times, the probability is still 50%, but the “odds” of flipping a coin 100 times in a row and getting heads every single time would be astronomical.

Either way, that’s what that gambling strategy works off of, the odds of hitting the same color X times in a row.

The odds of seeing 10 reds in succession are 1 in (2.06)10 = 1 in 1376. Pretty low odds that you´ll ever see this, in other words. But that doesn´t mean it isn´t going to happen.

The point is that the events are independent, so seeing that someone has already flipped 99 coins and got tails each time (or that a roulette wheel has come up red 99 times) gives you no information about what will happen next.  The odds of flipping a coin 100 times and getting tails 100 times may be very small, but the odds of that 100th flip being tails (after the other 99 flips have been made and all come up tails) is still 50/50.",2020-03-21

The problem is that past performance doesn’t guarantee future performance, and highly volatile penny stocks are no exception.

You’re replicating a Martingale strategy, essentially.  The only exception is that there’s no guarantee that the stock will go up again, so your losses could just continue to grow.",2020-03-21
260,Professor_SWGOH,flmgnnd,/r/pennystocks/comments/fml8fz/simple_trading_strategy_this_is_how_its_meant_to/flmgnnd/,1,"Correct.  In theory they are discrete events and can be considered “memoryless” with a predetermined probability of each outcome occurring.  The previous roll has no bearing on future rolls.

Strictly speaking, if a table has more reds in a row it is more probable that the next roll will be a red.  The wheel could be imbalanced.  The red/black alternation makes this unlikely, but what if I said that 3500 of 10000 rolls ended on one quadrant of the board instead of the expected 2500?  That is convincing evidence that bets placed in that quadrant have better odds than advertised.

Either way... OP would be wrong to go with the opposite of the table’s previous rolls statistically speaking.",2020-03-21
261,Jimmy_bags,flmzres,/r/pennystocks/comments/fml8fz/simple_trading_strategy_this_is_how_its_meant_to/flmzres/,1,"The only way a loss would continue to grow is if it hit zero.  Which doesnt happen very often if at all.  It may not be a day trade or even a swing trade, but it has results.  I havent had a penny stock in years that is consistently down for more than 6 days straight, with the exception of pandemic/recession and NON penny stock.  Dividing your cash into 1/6 (more or less) and patience is the key.  My other comment explained it may be considered a variation of ""smooth"" martingale. But even the article admitted the strategy is the most statistically correct in that the odds of a stock to fall that much over a long period of time are slim.  And yes I believe pennies are volatile but also less news/fed related price swings.  You sell for profit asap.  

P.s. any stock is really a gamble but you can increase your odds.  I wouldnt tell anyone a losing strategy, I've been doing this for a couple months now and never fails.",2020-03-21
