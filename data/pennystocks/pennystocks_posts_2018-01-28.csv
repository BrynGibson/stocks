9,PennyStock Diaries: EP:1 $1000 + ADTM = ?,7tmusd,FuckGasparGomez,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7tmusd/pennystock_diaries_ep1_1000_adtm/,5,5,"I just came into some extra cash and I have been studying the OTC for over a year now pretty seriously and have decided to finally give it serious try. anyway Check the technical on this thing, do some DD, We all know this company is piece of shit with no real plan but I believe a real opportunity is approaching. Fuck it, its only a $1,000 and this could change my life for the better.

This trading week I plan to have a entry $900-$1200 in at 0.0008 - 0.0013 range(Between 800k - 1 M shares) and then build add on there in time. 

I've been watching ADTM every day since the Late July 2017 @ 0.0004. Its been having very healthy movements finding support at each level. right now its in the middle of a pull back and even though its a little later than I want I'm still going to get in. ATDM is have identical movements like how DOLV(now JBYZ) did last year and also what IFXY did weeks ago. check the charts. 

Targets are 0.03 / 0.06 

$1000 /  0.0011 = 909,090 Shares

909,090  x 0.0060 =  $5,454 - 
909,090 x 0.0150 =   $13, 636 - 
                  0.03    =   $ 27k  -
                  0.045  =   $ 40k  - 
                  0.053  =   $ 48.1k - 

I personally want to get my investment back then let her ride. Then hopefully to the Porsche Dealer and then for 6 rounds of strippers and whores and a night of regret. See you on the other side.
