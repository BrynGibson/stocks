Could be a couple dollars with a few trades. I am just waiting till they put out their first press release. Went Pink current this morning. Seems like a big company, if you look at the 12+ filings they submitted in the last 3 weeks.

7,SDRC - Mega DD on gold miner trading at .022,e2k4w7,1827338989,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e2k4w7/sdrc_mega_dd_on_gold_miner_trading_at_022/,1,5,"Disclaimer - I am long on SDRC since .02 and believe this stock can reach .10 and fast. Here is some DD. I believe this is a rare opportunity in the OTC.  


SDRC is a gold miner and has a float of 71M shares. That means the total supply that can be traded is only 71M which is very low for a penny stock. For comparison, SHMP has a 200m share float and ran to .98 from .01 in just a few weeks. NO DEBT. NO DILUTION. which is also, very very rare for a penny stock. Gold put in new 52 week highs recently.

$SDRC. Largest $GOLD Assay sample I have ever seen in the OTC. While digging into their dealings in Republic, WA I found more info on SDRC's activity in Idaho. They are legitimate, very active, and getting stuff done, CONFIRMED.

Let's take a deeper look at their recent activity in Idaho.   1. All mines showing CURRENT and ACTIVE as of 2019 and thru 2020.   2. Land status Checked and Fees JUST paid on 8/29.   3. Map scans uploaded as recent as 9/20/2019.. :) [$SDRC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SDRC&amp;src=cashtag_click) and their mines are very ACTIVE

In detail what the funder said about the Lucky Ben Mine and [$SDRC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SDRC&amp;src=cashtag_click).   ""He describes it as one of the most exciting projects he has reviewed and from his vast mining experience he stated it is a project of a life time.""

**This company is looking at acquiring 100+ claims. Drill data has showed up to 1.4oz/ton of dirt, average of about 0.7 which is massive. Only a matter of time, good entry point**

&amp;#x200B;

For comparison, MDRPF is another miner trading at .47 with a very similar float. They have .5 **grams** per ton. Sidney has an average from .25 to .50 **ounces** per ton. Do the math. Its a very big difference that financing can make.

During the winter months is the time these companies work on financing. I believe if SDRC gets funding, it could be a historic run and possible go to $1. Do your own DD as always! I think it wil go to .10 on speculation alone! Gold miner OTCs could become a huge bubble with gold hitting new highs! We've seen these bubbles before, and they provide insane gains.
