I bought a few weeks ago and had some mild success but all or a sudden, it crashes all the time. 

A not to mention I’ve been completely losing money ever sense. 

If anyone is updated/up to date - I would love to keet some drama. 

 Pretty much basically raise your hand if r/pennystocks has LOST YOU MONEY. 

I ENTERED SMALL AND ONLY PURCHASED 250 shares. And even that is driving my insane. Any relatable advice? Tips? Knowledge? ...I’m new and anything would be appreciated!

Thank you fellas!",2019-12-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e79rqc/oragenics/
2,Need advice on when to sell,e7gdv4,itzAspen,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e7gdv4/need_advice_on_when_to_sell/,1,50,"I’m relatively new to stocks and 18 years old. I invested $257 in BCRX for around 101 shares and yesterday profited 5% ($15) I’m wondering, when should I sell? Is there a certain percent profit I should decide on when to just take my profits? Or just wing it?",2019-12-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e7gdv4/need_advice_on_when_to_sell/
3,Anyone here have/heard of stories of people being super successful buying R/M?,e7j305,Smit_W,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e7j305/anyone_here_haveheard_of_stories_of_people_being/,1,11,"I never trade penny stocks and mainly focus on trading SPY options, IPOs, MJ stocks, etc.. However, after watching on the sidelines with what happened to the DCGD -&gt; GRNF R/M (stock went from basically $0 to $2.22 in 2 months), I've been investing my time more and more towards finding stocks that have the potential to make moves like DCGD. 

Although, for these kinds of stocks, how does one go about researching if they're basically dormant shell companies with no news? What's the steps you take in doing in depth research?

Right now, there seems to be a lot of hype surrounding $SBES in anticipation of next week. I'm in personally because I'm only putting up $200 worth of shares and this is seems to be a low risk/high reward situation. 

Have any of y'all ever had success in this niche?",2019-12-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e7j305/anyone_here_haveheard_of_stories_of_people_being/
