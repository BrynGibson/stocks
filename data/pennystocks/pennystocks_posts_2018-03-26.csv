12,$GERN True Potential,87agwt,ritedamian,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/87agwt/gern_true_potential/,20,17,"So I just purchased shares of $GERN and plan on buying more after some research

- Recently has been one of the strongest penny stocks to increase if not the highest

- Avg volume is 2 millions, currently at 9 million

- Currently is a collaboration partner with $JNJ

- Experimental blood cancer drug is soaring with phase 2 to come

With all of this success in such a short amount of time it is paving way for way more growth than we have already seen. The price is currently held lower than expected due to questioning of if $JNJ wants to procceed with second segment of trail but noted they wanted to review data from trail in 1st quarter of 2018. If they procceed, which may be likely due to recent success, projections see the stock hitting as high as 20$+ 

Also worth noting if $JNJ does procceed typically FDA has high chance of Approval with a partner especially ones the size of JNJ

Any additional information would be greatly appreciated:)",2018-03-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/87agwt/gern_true_potential/

14,"NVCN intends to monitor the market value between now and September 18, 2018 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period",87a8p9,suitology,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/87a8p9/nvcn_intends_to_monitor_the_market_value_between/,7,17,"Neovasc Inc. (""Neovasc"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: NVCN) announced today that it has received written notification (the ""Notification Letter"") from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum market value requirement set forth in Nasdaq Rules for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) requires companies to maintain a minimum market value of US $35 million and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C) provides that a failure to meet the market value requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the market value of the Company for the 30 consecutive business days from February 6, 2018 to March 21, 2018, the Company no longer meets the minimum market value requirement.

The Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until September 18, 2018, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's market value must exceed US $35 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 18, 2018, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance.

The Company intends to monitor the market value between now and September 18, 2018 and intends to cure the deficiency within the prescribed grace period. During this time, we expect that the Company's common shares will continue to be listed and trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market.

The Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter.

The Company is also listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Notification Letter does not affect the Company's compliance status with such listing.

I sorted out searches by volume and the first most common question people ask about penny stocks is ""what are penny stocks?"".

I thought this is a great starting point.

In this video, I will explain in details what are penny stocks and will go through key points. 

I took two explanations for this term from two different sources (Investopedia and SEC websites). I used main points from these sources to get into specifics.

In this video, I will talk about main aspects of a penny stock so you could understand ""what are penny stocks?"".

I tried not to use difficult language and tried my best to keep this as simple as possible.
