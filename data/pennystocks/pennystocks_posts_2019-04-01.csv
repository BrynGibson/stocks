1,Stock Trading Diary - Week 5,b7vv1v,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b7vv1v/stock_trading_diary_week_5/,33,6,"### Week 5

Nice bounce back week for me after the miserable week I had last week. Didn't expect to recoup all the losses I took last week and then some, but that's exactly what happened. The big winner of the week was BIOC was able to net over $2,000 in profit on that trade alone! Anyways ended up with a net profit this week of **$1,759.43**! Looking forward to building upon that this upcoming week! Let's jump into some more details from the week.

These were the tickers I traded for the week of March 25th 2019:

* BIOC
* ARPO
* STAF

Here is the log of all the trades including entries and exits from this week:

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the log above, pretty solid week overall. Went two for three. Honestly a little frustrated with ARPO. Didn't have my stop loss set when it slid at open late this past week. Could have saved $100-$200 had I had it set. But overall I am pretty happy with the outcome of last week.

As a reminder, my account is going to look much larger this week than it did last week. As I mentioned last week, I added $7,100 to my account. The reason I added these funds is because I am using a cash account and wanted to be able to get into 1-2 more trades per week while still allocating the same amount of money per trade. Looking forward to fully testing this out this coming week! Anyways, this account started with $16,330 this past week and ended with $18,090! Hopefully I can reach $20,000 here shortly!

### Trade Highlights

**BIOC -** Pretty happy with how this trade turned out. This was my third time trading BIOC in the past month or so. The first two times I ended up selling too early and leaving a lot of money on the table. This time I wanted to ensure I captured a bigger chunk of the move. I entered this trade on Monday at $1.01. Didn't expect such a big move so quickly but next day we got a nice gap up to $1.10. I had seen this story play out too many time, I sell at $1.10 then see it go to like $1.30. Wasn't going to happen this time. I watched the 5 minute chart and was waiting for the first red candle to place my sell. Stock went up to $1.15, $1.20, $1.25, $1.28. Then it started to slide a bit and I sold at $1.23. I was able to net over $2,000 profit and plan on re-entering this stock once it goes under $1.03 again. The setup is still very much intact.

**ARPO -** This trade was pretty disappointing to be honest. I really thought entering at $1.05 and selling at $1.12 was going to be a no brainer. Stock had taken a steep fall and then seemed to base at the $1.05 level. The other downside was my risk vs. reward ratio was not very good. I was looking for a 7 cent move to the upside and risking a 6-7 cent move to the downside. Too risky, shouldn't have even entered the trade with those numbers. I forgot to set my stop loss the day that I exited and the stock fell almost immediately at open on Thursday. I was able to sell out as it was downtrending at $0.95. Unfortunately that was a much bigger loss than I wanted and gave back some of the gains I had just received from BIOC. Had I kept my stop loss in place at $0.99 I would have only taken a $250 loss instead of $500.

**STAF -** This trade really couldn't have played out more perfectly. I entered this trade at $1.43 support level and had a $1.51 price target on it. Set my limit buy at $1.43 and was able to get that filled. Stock basically hovered between $1.43-$1.46 for a day or two and then we got a nice run on Friday to $1.51. Stock tapped $1.51, filled my limit sell and then slid back down. This is another trade I would consider re-entering at $1.42-$1.43 range.

### Key Takeaways

My key takeaways from this week are making sure I keep or have my stop loss in place and ready to be hit on each of my trades. This is the second week in a row where I could have limited my loss substantially by having my stop loss in place. SFUN last week and ARPO this week. Combined I could have saved about $500 by having my stop loss in place. It is important to not get too confident in a play that you don't think it will burn you. Other than that I think I played this past week very well. Caught most of the move in BIOC and could not have played STAF much better than the way I did. I am looking forward to now having a little more funds to trade with and being able to enter some more trades each week!

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey for this week. Keep on following and commenting for future weeks. Looking forward to what everyone has to say this week!

Saw Charles Schwab, seemed interesting but sign up options didnt include canada. Bonus: if there's a referal/sign up bonus.

I am trying to figure out when I acquired it but it was years ago.    Was planning on moving my brokerage account to another firm and wanted to clear this because I do not think it will transfer correctly, its not even listed with symbol, its listed with V004140.  My broker will take it off my account so I can claim a loss.  Is this stupid to do? Normally I would wait until December but since I want to move brokerages thinking of doing it now.

(“WorkDone”) on the strategic relationship formed with Findability Sciences; an investment and partnership arrangement. 

“In the world of AI and hi-tech, when you have the opportunity to align with a company like Findability Sciences, you know you’re on the right track,” stated Ajene Watson, CEO of Digital Asset Monetary Network. “Findability Sciences has made a strategic investment into [WorkDone](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zEn41ZBsAvlpOlhBnpjQN9dpJp0BCz7Q9fyVJDDdfuVFGsadielVf1JrXQwzNtw_CrHTyMmleb8UJ4N-EAUQ4A==) \[an artificial intelligence corporate memory company\], which tells us… we made a wise decision in supporting WorkDone early on, and we will continue to do so.”

WorkDone, a client-company of DigitalAMN, was initially onboarded onto TruCrowd, Inc.’s equity crowdfunding portal, [truCrowd.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aCeGoeaMB3YDpcfHBtdbyCOVO5DeVEbFrnP7oci5-BXjwyxyXtUFaBxTMcM5o_GFU1438sgcAR__edGxD0OAAw==). WorkDone later went on to [announce its relationship with Atlanta-based, 3V Solutions,](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zidR1-eDlvPBbtUWuKJT3ZUmvdqZnJskWIkCIjsZ_iiXwZs8d_Bi9q4Kt6Nu4eaIQWnga_rqGRvLRjb5le9uewyEh9MrZMFxNbLULkO0jr2czC4Qh9mxINFT9fIWprk2cSyhk7b8jhMeZzOP87HxZyG_DvK690tsqVYlOq4L3oNG3SioP64Nuhe4ITR0sPSAq-bFslrB2kOZQr4LtTrzCmVDs171PH8KcIvDvDmPLGu4n7270eD1UtGKkiPYlgohzsDyqnhP_4y3z2K1VoXpStNjALSCAk8tLh9lK3CJPOYHxuuh8ogrD5GOLOma5IWq) to deliver their patent-pending, machine learning Expertise Capture technology to SAP customers. Now, WorkDone is slated to co-create the next generation of integrated solutions targeted to businesses around the world.

Watson concluded, “Strategic relationships with companies like Findability Sciences will ultimately outshine our initial participation in startups like WorkDone. That is exactly what we want to see, given that our goal is to introduce everyday people to investment opportunities in high value, fast-growth startups when they are affordable; giving everyone, including DATI shareholders, early access to the potential ‘unicorns’ of tomorrow.”

Management is confident that with the increase in knowledge and resources WorkDone will receive from their strategic relationship with Findability Sciences, the future value of artificial intelligence is closer to DATI shareholders than anticipated.
