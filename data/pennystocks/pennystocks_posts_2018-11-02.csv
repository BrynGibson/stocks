2.) https://www.cxoadvisory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sector-winners-and-losers-by-calendar-month.png
Basically, according to these charts some of the  overall most profitable months of the year are October, November, and December, (all averaging about .5-3%). (Here I’ll only be covering Nov-Dec). With the biggest sectors in Nov and December being XLB, (Materials Select Sector SPDR), and XLI, (Industrial Select Sector SPDR), both averaging 2.5-3% overall. Now with all that being said, in my next post I will be breaking down some of the stocks within these sectors to be looking out for, when to buy in, and when to get out. Stay tuned and I hope this works.

I have deposited $1,000 US (yesterday morning) into a trading, and spread it as follows:


GBHPF:US (global Hemp Group) 4000 shares at 0.09. They are a hemp company not focused on the psychoactive part, but using the plan for everything else.

PTNYF: US (ParcelPal) 51 shares at 0.44. there a digital parcel delivery company that has a new deal with Amazon. 

TAKOFF: US (Drone Delivery Canada) 500 shares at 1.35. there a drone delivery technology company working with some native government bodies within Canada. 


The price I paid is based on the average they charged me. I deposited $1,030, which covered my cost of 3 trades as well, and right now I have a market value of 1013.

My goal is to turn this 1000 dollars into retirement money as fast as I possibly can, haha.
