You should look on IRS.gov for the form called 1040-NR and find the separate instructions for that form. But first, look there for the IRS publication called Tax Guide for Aliens or something like that. Read it. Determine if you’re a resident or non-resident according to the rules outlined in those 2 PDF’s. They will tell you your classification and what you’re obligated to do/file for taxes.
