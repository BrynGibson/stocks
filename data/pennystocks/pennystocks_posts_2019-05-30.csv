""Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) is a leader in aerospace defense contracts and development of cybersecurity. This company has the eyes of many investors thanks to a strong history of beating analyst projections. While Trump tweets and tariffs harm most companies, Northrop has shown they can move around in the hardest political environments thrown at them. While their stock has recently gotten weaker, the company may still be quite promising. 

Management is focusing on aggressively raising the dividend, with a target on delivering returns to shareholders.""",2019-05-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/busqr6/defense_spending_picks_up_as_securitythreat/

 They lost 4 million in one quarter, and if you look at the statement below, it shows they only have 8 million in cash, so at this rate, they only have two more quarters before [they run out of money](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/30/rewalk-dd/)

 It's much easier for them to raise money in the stock market than to go to a bank. We live in unusual times. In a normal world, a company would be hesitant to dilute their ownership. Nobody wants to share a business with somebody if they don‚Äôt have to, but because the market is so bullish, companies can literally just create stock out of thin air, then somehow find a way to sell it. In a normal market where interest rates are not at record lows, there wouldn‚Äôt be anybody to buy something like this. As you can see below, they are attempting to [register 75 million](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/30/rewalk-dd/) worth of stock for future issuance

Gunpowder strongly believes that current positive movement and indicators in the Cryptocurrency market, along with identified significant growth opportunities in the space, warrant its continued investment in this subsidiary at this time.
