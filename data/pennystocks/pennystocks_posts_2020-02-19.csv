This company called FNHI or franchise holdings international inc apparently owns a company called worksport trucks. They make pickup bed tonneau covers. The catch is they are solar powered and will help with normal operations of  essentials without killing the battery. 


Anyway, they received a trademark for the worksport name back in January. I bought about 1500 dollars worth of this stock so nothing insane but I think it's going to move. Take a look, do your own DD.",2020-02-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f64x15/fnhi/

### NamSys Inc. Company Profile:

* NamSys Ticker: CTZ.V (TSXV) NMYSF (PNK)

* Share Price: $1.09
* Market Cap: $29.7 million
* Shares Outstanding: 27.3 million
* Options and Warrants: None
* Cash and Short Term Investments: $4.4 million
* Debt: $0

**Disclosure: I own shares of NamSys (CTZ.V).**

**For my complete analysis check out**  [https://battleshipinvesting.com/namsys-analysis/](https://battleshipinvesting.com/namsys-analysis/) It's just my free blog. Not trying to sell anything

NamSys is a very profitable Canadian based microcap. They offer their Cirreon software package that makes processing cash much more efficient. They are growing revenue 20+% and have 30+% net income margins.

The share price has taken off recently but I still think the company is a buy in the $1.05-$1.15 range. They don't issue any options so there is no dilution to shareholders.

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Positives

* Strong balance sheet, no debt
* High insider ownership
* 80+% recurring revenue
* Zero dilution
* Asset light, takes no reinvestment
* High margins and excellent profitability
* Easily scalable
* Brinks relationship
* Focus on customer service
* Solid 20+% revenue growth

## Negatives

* Customer concentration with Brinks
* Employee bonus plan
* The decline in cash use worldwide
* Declining margins",2020-02-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f6fqr1/ctzv_nmysf_namsys_a_very_profitable_saas_microcap/
