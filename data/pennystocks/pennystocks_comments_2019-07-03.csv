Who knows what it will get up to.  The app release should be around August and that may cause a small run.  But it's really about how many people start using it after the app release.

I've tried hard to think of real uses for the app and came up with only a few legit uses so that was enough for me to hold a small position.

I think people hyping this stock on twitter are a bit silly sometimes and would better get the word out by promoting the app name ""Arknet"" rather than it's ticker symbol as to normies, it seems more like some get rich quick scheme rather than an exciting new app.

Additionally, the stock regularly swings between the low .004's and low .005's so if you get in and feel over time it's going nowhere, you can always bail and win/loose a small amount.

2. I have a real investment account that isn't a penny stock account. My retirement, investments, and savings are all in much safer vehicles than penny stocks.
