As well just because stocks have low float doesn't mean it is always pumped. In this instance do not underestimate the herd mentality with maniac symptoms when trading low floater.

I see a lot of people always think there is nothing more than illegal schemes going on. Yes there are many but there is a lot of irrational exuberance. Maybe too much:)
