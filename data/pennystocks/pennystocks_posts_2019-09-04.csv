0,Second Shippers Alert,czdjd4,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/czdjd4/second_shippers_alert/,17,3,"   Pumps aren’t for the weak of heart. However if you can get in on the right side of them you can put some cash in your account. The reason we are in penny stocks primarily is for the higher risk and  higher reward. Many times that comes though pumps whether  the company is legit or not.

     The shipping stocks season is upon us again and some accumulation is already starting. I’m already up 40% since my first alert a couple weeks ago. If these suckers do a third of what they did last year I’ll easily bank more than 100%. My goal is 200% but we will see what happens. 

    Look at the shipping sector, identify the ones that ran once or twice during the last couple years seasons and consider the risk. 

   It is a risk and it will dump “if” it pumps so have an exit strategy. All of these shocks still have plenty of room left to make a nice profit. 

    There are many to choose from but my personal ones are ESEA, DCIX, and GLBS. 

    Good luck should you choose to play the shippers this year.",2019-09-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/czdjd4/second_shippers_alert/

About the Marudi Gold Project

The Company is developing the Marudi Gold Project which has an 17-mining license is located in Guyana, South America. There has been historic diamond drilling completed on the project by prior operators that have delineated two zones of mineralization: Mazoa Hill and Marudi North zones. The Company has completed a mineral resource estimate on the Mazoa Hill zone containing 259,100 indicated gold ounces within 4,428,000 tonnes grading 1.8 g/t and 86,200 inferred gold ounces within 1,653,000 tonnes grading 1.6 g/t. The Company has recently discovered a third mineralized zone: Toucan Ridge. There exists excellent exploration upside for the further discovery of mineralized zones through the development of previously and newly identified mineralized bedrock targets on the project.

The company is currently building its 5th board game cafe location in Tucson, and just announced the acquisition of its 6th location in Guelph, previously The Boardroom. Boardroom's founder states in the press release "" Snakes and Lattes is the ‘gold standard’ for board game cafés worldwide"":

Snakes and Lattes acquired board game developer Morning and is currently in the process of releasing their own self-published game ""Kill the Unicorns"" for the upcoming holiday season:

https://twitter.com/AmfilTech/status/1151308235078430720

At its 25$ price point this early print run represents 1M$ in revenue, and the company already has an agreement in place for the game with Walmart, so the Christmas print runs could be significantly larger:

The share price is currently depressed because of a very lengthy audit/uplist process from OTCPink to OTCQB. However, the initial audit risk is mitigated by the fact that FY2016 and FY2017 have been fully audited and signed off on, and 2018 and 2019 are expected shortly, which will enable uplist to QB. With verified 2017 revenues 8,168,251$, in my view this is a good buying opportunity with prices depressed by the lengthy ongoing audit process:

Kickstarter board game releases and the game industry in general are booming, and board game cafes are popping up in college towns and big cities all over the world; Snakes and Lattes is _by far_ the most well-established board game cafe brand in the world, and seems poised to be a major player in this emerging cafe and game publishing+fulfillment industry.

LAS VEGAS, Sept. 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexteligent Holdings, Inc. f/k/a Efftec International, Inc. (OTC:EFFI) (“Nexteligent”) is pleased to announce that Revenue Maximization Group (RMG), the Revenue Cycle Management and Preventative Wellness arm of Nexteligent, has been selected by CIO Applications Magazine as one of the Top 25 Healthcare Solution Providers of 2019.  


RMG, which was recently acquired by Nexteligent, provides Preventative Wellness and Revenue Cycle Management services for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, clinics, and doctor networks.  Through its Revenue Cycle Management services, the company increases collections, shortens cash flow cycles, and reduces denials for its clients.  Its Preventative Wellness practice implements annual wellness visits, chronic care management, transitional care management, and remote patient monitoring. 

“RMG analyzes the entire preventative care service and revenue cycle chain for our clients,” said Stuart Miller, CEO, Revenue Maximization Group. “Through our ability to interrogate data we can identify lack of accuracy in coding and inconsistent workflows which can result in significant loss of revenue for healthcare facilities. Based on our findings we can specifically design and operationalize meaningful solutions to eliminate redundancy and increase revenue for healthcare organizations.”

Mr. Miller also noted that physicians might be missing out on Medicare reimbursement if they do not have the bandwidth or resources to interpret complex Medicare guidelines. “We have developed a simplified process to help healthcare organizations increase revenue and improve clinical outcomes by   optimizing the use of Medicare preventative coding structures,” he added.",2019-09-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cznj0w/effi_revenue_maximization_group_recognized_by_cio/
