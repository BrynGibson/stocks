Is there a difference?), how long does it take for you to actually make the sale? Like, I'm assuming you have to wait until somebody actually wants to buy whatever your selling. So if you wait until the price peaks and then sell in that instance; do you just get the money then and there? Do you have to wait 2 days for someone to come along and be interested in what you have? It just seems like you wouldn't be able to make money by timing your sales just right unless there happened to be people on the other end hungrily waiting to buy up your shares.",2018-11-23

4,scithe,eabbpkj,/r/pennystocks/comments/9zqu0b/psiq/eabbpkj/,1,I was not familiar with PSIQ so I looked it up.  The company is supposed to be a security company doing like biometric time clocks for businesses.  Yet they just got a deal to distribute Cheech and Chong's beard oils and other stuff?  ,2018-11-23

For example, IGPK. Can't find it on robinhood.",2018-11-23
13,crackopenabook,eajkown,/r/pennystocks/comments/9zlqgz/simple_questions_november_23_2018/eajkown/,1,"OTC, or pink sheets stocks like IGPK are traded through the over-the-counter market and are available on Fidelity, eTrade, TD Ameritrade, etc. 

Commission-free sites like Robinhood and Webull do not support these as they have (additional) fees.

OTC stocks are riskier too, though Iâ€™m not sure if that is part of the reason why Robinhood (or Webull) doesnâ€™t support them. 

I have found that Webull has more companies available to trade than Robinhood. I have seen a few penny stocks (below $5) on WB that are not available to trade on Robinhood. 

If you donâ€™t already have a Webull account and are considering, please use my link to sign up and weâ€™ll both receive a free stock:
https://act.webull.com/i/sfArrdtBhcMu

I use both and like both for different reasons. But you will find more trading available on WB. It isnâ€™t as user-friendly as RH,  but itâ€™s a great app and holds a lot of information and analytics. Plus, a free stock!",2018-11-23
