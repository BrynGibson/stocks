1,Weekly penny stocks recap $NFEC $MRIN $ASNS $ASTC $ADIL,a8wqd1,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a8wqd1/weekly_penny_stocks_recap_nfec_mrin_asns_astc_adil/,1,0,"Recap summary:

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting to penny stocks I think it is very important to address huge selloff we see across global equities. 

&amp;#x200B;

While micro and nano-cap stocks aka penny stocks tend to be more independent from the overall stock market trends when comparing to their bigger counterparts nevertheless most of these small stocks are impacted by a general stock market price trends as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

This week FED increased interest rate continuing their planned policy.  Interest rate and stock market price tend to have an inverse correlation, meaning that when interest rates go up stocks prices tend to go down and vice-versa. This is why it is important to understand that this selloff might be just the beginning of a bigger downtrend and trying to catch bottoms at these times would be a bad idea. So be extra careful when buying stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

This week started slow but microcap stocks got more active at the end of the week.

&amp;#x200B;

$NFEC stocked finally hit support level this week and bounce back hard. Overall I think major price move has ended and my interest in this stock is fading. Still keeping this stock in the watchlist to see if 14$ price level will hold. This price level can be a great entry price for a short-term short position.

&amp;#x200B;

$MRIN. Overextended chart patterns always end up with the same fashion. Look at $NFEC. These type of ""bubbly"" charts are doomed to implode and I expect $MRIN price to drop next week. It is not a good idea to buy the stock at these levels. Longs had their chance to make money and close their positions.  Most likely sellers and short sellers will take over next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

$ASNS as expected started selling off while no important news were released.  Stock's price closed at 50SMA, we might see a small bounce, but most likely ranging price or continue in sell-off.

&amp;#x200B;

$ASTC stock gained +47% during Friday trading day and closed green. No news were associated with the price move. Stock long-term price chart shows that stock has a history of price spikes and bigger price runs. Will see if some important news will drop next week. This can help bring volume to this stock and possible upward price run throughout the upcoming week.

&amp;#x200B;

$ADIL stock after previous nice price run now trades in the range with choppy price action. This might be a headache for traders while stock goes up and down without showing any clear price trend. I stay away from this stock while trading $ADIL is very ineffective and time-consuming.
