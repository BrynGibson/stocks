Gunpowder Makes a Further Investment into Cryptocurrencies via Bitblox Technologies Inc.



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Toronto, Ontario, February 20th, 2018 Gunpowder Capital Corp., (CSE: GPC), (CSE: GPC.PR.A), (OTCQB: GNPWF), (Frankfurt: YS6N), (Gunpowder or the Corporation) announced today that it has participated in Bitblox Technologies Inc.s (Bitblox) recently completed second round non-brokered Token Unit financing which was sold directly by Bitblox to accredited investors. Each Token Unit consists of one Token and one common share purchase warrant, which is automatically exerciseable for no additional consideration into one common share of Bitblox immediately prior to a liquidity event of Bitblox. The Token also has the right, on a pro-rata basis, to participate in Bitbloxs profit sharing program, which can reach up to thirty-five percent (35%) of the quarterly profit of Bitblox as determined by Bitbloxs Board of Directors



Gunpowder purchased 1,000,000 Token Units at price of $0.10 CDN per Token Unit for a total commitment of $100,000.00 CDN. BitBlox raised a total of $419,350.00 CDN in its second round.



Mr. Paul Haber Stated: Cryptocurrencies are perhaps the most exciting sector in the markets today and we are extremely pleased in having the opportunity to increase our investment with BitBlox Technologies Inc. While there will continue to be corrections and unnerving gyrations in the cryptocurrency space, despite the recent pullbacks, we at GPC, believe that the future remains bright for cryptocurrencies. The late 1990shype that led to the original dot-com bubble and subsequent burst did not signal the end the internet. At that point we could scarcely imagine what mainstream adoption of the internet would look like; the social and mobile revolutions were still years off. Silicon Valley didn't go anywhere. Instead, it was back and bigger than ever within a decade. We feel the same will hold true for cryptocurrencies.



About Bitblox Technologies Inc.



Bitblox Technologies Inc. is building a high value cryptocurrency enterprise. Bitblox mines cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and ZCash, and offers value-added technology services for the cryptocurrency market, such as crypto-mining proprietary software.



Offering a complete ecosystem of value-creation, Bitblox cryptocurrency mining will provide the basis for an innovative token product that is monetized according to mining profit margins. A percentage of these profits will be invested in the development of a proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology. Overall, Bitblox takes an approach that enables the company to scale, and respond to changing conditions, within the still-emerging cryptocurrency industry.



Part of a wave of emerging technologies, cryptocurrencies are indivisible from a new virtual economy that is powered in part by smart contract and other AI-based integrations. Cryptocurrency and value mining are central to this new paradigm. Taking a robust and diversified business approach, Bitblox Technologies Inc. is poised to capture value in successive phases as this industry continues to scale.

SALT LAKE CITY, UT , Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Investview Corporation (INVU) filed its third quarter financials for the period ending December 31st, 2017 while seeing a significant increase in January 2018 billings generating positive cash flow for the first time.  

Investview and its wholly owned subsidiary Wealth Generators reported a net loss of just over $7.1 million-dollars for the 3-month period ending December 31st, 2017. This certainly does not appear to be the type of news one broadcasts through a press release, but we believe the story behind the numbers is important to share as $6.7 million dollars or approximately 92% of that loss can be attributed to stock issuances. This generated a net loss of approximately $402k for the period down from a loss of over $1M for the prior quarter.

These stock issuances are through agreements we have entered that bring additional talent, revenue and products to the company and many are structured to award additional shares based upon revenue growth to the company. This expense is designed to initiate growth and cash flow.

The acquisition of Wealth Generators by Investview Inc. was done to accomplish three goals: 1) arrange for proper company financing, 2) use equity (shares) to acquire additional assets and 3) establish a higher level of transparency through public reporting requirements.

You could say we took our objectives very seriously as we increased our authorized shares, made a series of strategic partnerships, settled or converted outstanding debt while working to increase our revenue.  

In January of 2018 we issued a press release announcing an unaudited estimated increase in gross revenues of 38% (Press Release February 5th, 2018) http://ow.ly/B4zR30iseGw. While we did increase our gross billings by 38% for the prior quarter, what was even more impressive was that our cash flow turned positive for the first time in January of 2018.

William Kosoff, Acting CFO stated, “Having been with the parent company Investview Inc. since 2005 and tirelessly waiting to achieve positive cash flow, I find the accomplishments over the last nine months very impressive and even more reassuring are the positive financial indicators we are beginning to see. We first look for revenue growth, followed by a reduction in losses, then positive cash flow which should ultimately bring us to positive earnings.”
