The new company directors were updated on NVSOS. Appears to be this huge venture capitalist company?

I was able to find all directors involved in some sort of venture capital roles. I think this is the next big runner. Joseph Arcaro shells are known to run huge. Combine that with the Chinese company merging in and the tiny float. Thoughts?",2019-10-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddhrg4/joseph_arcaro_shell_lege_sold_12_mil_float_0271/
3,Report out on $FTXP - Note is done converting. 52 week range is $0.01 to $0.68 (Its at $0.01) and note is done.,ddp7yq,Shelby_Picks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddp7yq/report_out_on_ftxp_note_is_done_converting_52/,13,3,"Was wondering why it was getting so much action late friday towards the close. Main market maker for the first time since the note started vanished. Makes sense now. Check this out.

&gt;Take together, this shows a total of 12.5 million of shares traded since the maturity of the note. This translates into $187,000. With a 15% buy indifference, we can see roughly $150,000. The note is $115,000 (the “Note”), before giving effect to certain transactional costs including legal fees. Even with the raise in A/S (not effective), the O/S has stayed the same. The float is likely to stay the same as well. Most interesting is the reason for the note in the first place, and such a small one that appears to be already paid off.  
Look at this graphically, we can see a downward deg ratio from $0.10, which means a return to $0.10 would be expected, without the note.",2019-10-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddp7yq/report_out_on_ftxp_note_is_done_converting_52/
