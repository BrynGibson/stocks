They claim to have gotten a bigger warehouse, into more stores but the stock plummeted. I’ll hold since I’m in deep. Anyone else’s take on this?

1,$DMAN The Beast is awakening. Details here...,egmkd4,SharkStocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/egmkd4/dman_the_beast_is_awakening_details_here/,1,19,"Folks, as you may have seen the recent jump in DMAN volume and price.  This company is coming into 2020 with a BANG.  Spreading the word as these sub prices @ pps is insanely undervalued, and market cap correction is quickly underway.  I'm not one to yell ""Load an OTC Penny play"" but this one just cannot be overlooked.  Good luck y'all!!!
