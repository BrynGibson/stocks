14,mudbuttcoffee,e5n2dzk,/r/pennystocks/comments/9e8ul3/looking_for_some_mentorship/e5n2dzk/,1,"It's not about the size of the stocks.  Penny stocks are usually very volatile,  low value,  low information,  and is more akin to gambling.   You can do your due diligence,  you can also get sucked into someone's pump and dump. 

Stocks are about growing your money,  sure take a few flyers at some penny stocks,  if you have the capital learn about options and take a shot here and there.  Keep options and penny stocks to minimal amounts of your portfolio. 

Having $100 of a $0.02 stock and $100 of a $50.00 stock is still having $100.00. The key is how much do you think each stock is going to gain,  what is the point that you feel comfortable buying and more importantly,  what is your exit plan for that security? Are you holding for long term gains and dividends?  Do you expect 5, 10, 15% gains? Over what time do you expect those results?  What is your exit plan if your expectations aren't met?  

Pouring money into penny stocks generally is not a great beginner strategy,  sure the draw of finding a company that's trading for a nickel and shooting up to a quarter sounds great... but is rare.   

Good luck,  you are doing the best thing by starting early.   Set some long term goals.   Buy some dividend payers, invest in some mainstream stocks,   add money as often as possible.   Always remember to pay your future self first.   After you build some experience and have some money in your portfolio,  then I would recommend starting to get more adventurous.  ",2018-09-09

62,superheadlock,e5o8igt,/r/pennystocks/comments/9eecrk/trying_to_make_money_fast_with_270/e5o8igt/,1,"Get a discount brokerage account like Stash or Robinhood. For what you have I would recommend Robinhood since it’s free. 

1st step: consider how much of that 270 you could reasonably stand to lose. If it is 100% disposable then that gives a variety of strategies, if you can’t tolerate any risk of loss, then that gives you a different set of strategies. My guess is that you are somewhere in the middle. Take a reasonable portion of it that you absolutely don’t want to lose and put in a low risk investment, like an ETF or a reasonably stable stock, like coca cola, Kimberly Clark, Johnson and Johnson. Etc..

Then take the remaining portion that you could stand to lose, let’s say you are willing to risk 70$. Take a small portion into something highly volatile and watch it every day. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency you can buy on Robinhood that’s super cheap and fluctuates little by little. It’s possible to time and make some money, but it’s also likely you will lose money. Search investopedia for real strategies and learn to use their screener to find cheap, volatile stocks. ",2018-09-09
