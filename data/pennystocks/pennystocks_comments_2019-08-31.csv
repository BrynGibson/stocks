4,heliogt2,eymoe0b,/r/pennystocks/comments/cxpecu/stock_traders_dilemma/eymoe0b/,1,"Interesting Lee as a class penny stocks are some og the least random. 

The price trajectory over time of the typical OTC pump and dump scheme is highly predictable. The issue is the due to a lack of liquidity, spreads, the inability to short etc. it is difficult to monetize this action unless you are part of the group that is actually controlling the scheme.

And if you're controlling the scheme you're worrying about the SEC, and your business partners fucking you in the ass. 

Happy Trading!",2019-08-31

2. I enjoy your vernacular, but at some points it seems that you are almost *trying* to fit as many ""fancy"" words as you can. It almost loses its luster when you overdo it, you know?
3. Your previous post that you deleted said what you learned in 6 years of daytrading, but then it got deleted and this is the new post. Just a typo? Also, you say you started a fund in '02 but simultaneously claim to only have been trading for 9 years? I think I am missing something.",2019-08-31
