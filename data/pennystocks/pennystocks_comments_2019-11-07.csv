Does that mean I’ll make 200 thousand or is there something to it.  I have no experience with stocks.",2019-11-07
99,Penis-Envys,f79w18m,/r/pennystocks/comments/dsqgii/what_if_you_short_every_penny_stock/f79w18m/,1,"If you bought a “share” of stock meaning you own the a tiny part of the company then if the value double you now have 2 million assuming you put all 1 million in that stock. But penny stocks (stocks under 5$) are usually dangerous and volatile. 

The only fee you pay is trading or commission fee which is like 5-10 dollars depending on the brokers. But now the climate is changing with Robinhood and trading is free for some brokers like Charles Schwab and Td Ameritrade. 

Options is different. Options you don’t own a stock or “share” you jus BET on if a stock goes up or down. 

You buy or sell options. If you buy you pay a fee for the “option contract” and if the bet the stock go down or up then you make your money back. 

If the option doesn’t go your way, you just lose the fee you paid for the option. 

Options are like insurance. 

If you sell options (more risky) you instantly make the cost of the fee you decide and if the person decide to use the option then you lose money. 

If the person never use the option you sold them you make money. 

Honesty you should do your own research. The basics are out there if you search around. Even if you don’t understand just keep on watching videos till your brain gets a hang of it.",2019-11-07
