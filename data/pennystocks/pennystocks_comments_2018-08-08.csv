They are working on a prostate cancer vaccination that got 80 percent success rates in Phase one FDA and are starting phase 2 August 15th. The staff behind the work are highly intelligent and have some good data backing them up. I believe this research could be groundbreaking and could change the medical field. I have heard that a buyout is potential, which could be beneficial for stock holders but I believe even if they held out on a buyout they could be worth a lot on their own. ",2018-08-08

I think phase one at 80% is promising. I think if people can get behind it and Keep investing it will benefit them to succeed. Another thing that gives me hope is there has been a lot of high investments recently which could possibly be a big pharma company buying shares up to make the buyout less of an upfront investment.

[Some 63 percent of drugs in Phase I testing advanced to Phase II, but only 33 percent of Phase II drugs made it to Phase III, which requires a commitment to larger and much more expensive clinical trials. Phase III is typically the final stage of human testing before a new drug is submitted to regulators for an approval decision](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-success/success-rates-for-experimental-drugs-falls-study-idUSTRE71D2U920110214).
