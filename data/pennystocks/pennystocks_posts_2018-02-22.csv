Already posted in r/daytrading but thought it'd post here as well :) . I currently use Questrade as my broker but still do use thinkorswim for the scanning. I run a demo account since I don't want to have $5000 sitting in an account I won't use. Just curious to what everyone is using as their scanner setups. Because it is a demo account you can't use the study filters for gap ups etc.

Thanks,

Mike
