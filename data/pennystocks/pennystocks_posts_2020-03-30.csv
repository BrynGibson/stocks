So I’m new to this whole reddit and stock market thing, but I’ve been doing some research, and based on what people have been saying about these pump and dumps or missing out on something before it gets big, if you miss out on something, short selling should be the way to go, no? Like I’ve seen a lot of fluctuations in the market, especially in these penny stocks, and if I buy high and just wait for it to go down, wouldn’t that be easier than waiting for it to go up? Or more predictable so to say, seeing what the worlds going through right now?

Now obviously it’s riskier, cause a stock could go up to 100 bucks or something and you short sold it at $5, but it seems to be an easier way to make money, no?",2020-03-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/frl4dx/short_selling_is_this_the_way_to_go/

9,Hidden gems overnight review,frgpih,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/frgpih/hidden_gems_overnight_review/,4,46,"Greetings folks. Boy, what a weekend we've all had despite the quarantine being stuck cooped up at home. However, given the free time available gave me the opportunity to review some charts for potential hidden gems. Found some incredible breakthrough and in addition to the discoveries found... noticed some overnight activity likely something incredible is coming, a hype rally, pending news, or simply just a chart play turn over either bouncing on the dead float squeezing the shorts, or even a bullish chart leading to a similarity such as TOPS from Friday.

Going forward, here are the following items that are in my opinion a sure thing for Monday or this week likely to break out. Here are some of the charts below:

[SCON](https://ibb.co/NnPBQ2T)

0.12 is the magic number both as support &amp; a HODL. Pay attention to the slow upward curl on the daily chart versus the right side chart (5day chart) and you can see the difference. The right side chart broke the resistance at an astonishing 0.17 &amp; STILL held, is a clear green light sign. Speculation leads to believe this is a sympathy hidden play. There are extremely heavy orders in three layers with 100.00k buys. Lastly... at 0.12 this is considered a double bottom. We can confidently say this is likely to do a pop play here. Overall, a potential gap at 0.50+ target. Likelihood 70% chance.

&amp;#x200B;

[AIM](https://ibb.co/XLsPhNM)

At a glance, you can tell this is also a solid HODL. The main focal point here is the left chart; you can see this is making a stairway climb as it rests at 1.90 support with a resistance that needs to challenge at 2.15. Consolidation seems completed after the frenzy finished from its previous high at 7.1 from the past. The bottom line, keep an eye out for any sort of either overnight activity, or premarket. 50/50 play chance

&amp;#x200B;

[HUSA](https://ibb.co/ncY2Ggg)

Not much to say except I noticed an outside bar and someone bought in testing future resistance. For me to be actively convinced, I'd like it to break 0.121 (or maintain after opening). I'd say the probability of 30% for a multiday runner, but don't hold your breath. I just see it as a long atm.

&amp;#x200B;

[ACST](https://ibb.co/6BMg671)

Very readable.  You can tell on both charts bear shorts are no match bringing this down as they have tried multiple times on Friday. This is a very very tight squeeze nearly at the roof of the resistance line of 0.42. For a full confidence day play, I'd recommend it needs to break all 4 layers of the resistance (see right side chart). 60% chance.

&amp;#x200B;

[CTRM](https://ibb.co/3znGZbY)

Broke the bar as you can see the left side. HODL position virtually on the right-side chart. Has a decent medium float, anything can happen here. Yes, in short, this is an outside bullish bar, be weary but be cautious. I don't recommend buying just yet until there's a good volume above 1mil+. Support line 0.63 &amp; HODL line is 0.72, overall 60% chance for a multiday runner. I don't see any noticeable tick orders on Friday though.

&amp;#x200B;

XSPA

No chart needed here, I was informed there was a dark pool trade on someone else's chart appeared on a third-party platform (webull) cited by Likos. At first, it looked like a dagger fall (falling at 0.18) but the thin tail line at such a drastic trade (1.78M) means something is at play here similar to BIOC.
