Sorry to burst your bubble, but a lot of the information he acquires through his hard ""DD"", is information that others have done through their own DD. I'm not saying he doesn't do his own, just that he tends to ""Take"" a lot of it from others :)",2019-08-03

So let's say all his DD was just taking it from others that have put in all the hard work and not giving them a cent for it. It's alright for him to sell that information to others for a profit ? I'm assuming that's the stance you are taking on it.",2019-08-03
80,discardedcoffee,evyca3v,/r/pennystocks/comments/cli7oj/penny_stock_promoter_subscriptions/evyca3v/,1,"Is it Assumption Sunday? You said he gets some of the DD from other outlets. I said in response to that, that is what DD is. You dig. You get info from other people, the company and then you figure out if you can trust it, is the information well known, baked into the price etc. I would rather pay the hunter gatherer with consistent good information then suck the tit of a paid schill. At least the unnamed person is trying to find stocks to profit from. Sharing the information. Same thing that is happening here, this is not all OC DD on here. You literally just used google to explain to a guy your point. I am not going to make the phone calls, I am not sure I know where all of this information is posted, who can be trusted etc. How many times do you click the disclaimer and see the company or a third party paid for the release. Shit most penny stocks pay for analyst. Then I have to buy the analyst report, read it, dissect it and hopefully I can read it faster than the other people doing the same DD. People pay for information. It is the age we are in. You either lost money with Rig or compete. Either way I do not see your point. This poster does not even know how to google stock promoter subscriptions. People want information handed to them. You should think about that. One of the founders of this site killed himself because of a Federal investigation into him. He wanted information, research papers and studies made free to the public. Many times public funds funded those studies or paid for the literature. So yeah that is the world we are in. I am busy and I have no problem with the results he has generated and I really do not care if he gets it from his pasta shop. Why not share with me what you consider better and you can DM it since rule 1. Or at least be specific about Rig vs being an assuming ass to me.",2019-08-03
81,Thatguyfromdeadpool,evyf3o3,/r/pennystocks/comments/cli7oj/penny_stock_promoter_subscriptions/evyf3o3/,1,"So... You are agreeing that it's alright for him to do that then. Why the snarky comment then ? 

What did I use google on ? That's confusing me a bit. The guy you mentioned is well known throughout the community of just grabbing from others these days. I have no clue if he still has his pump group or not as well, I'd have to research that.

What I consider better is the research I do myself which is taken from people like him ,lol. You know how strange it is to see people who have these groups that charge anywhere from $40 - $500 a month for information and they mostly just reiterate or copy n paste what others say. Then you have these paid ""newsletters"" that charge a small fee for PR releases, which is just a damn RSS feed of FREE ones.

Also ""One of the founders of this site killed himself because of a Federal investigation into him"" ... Why would an innocent person kill themselves for being investigated ?

"" How many times do you click the disclaimer and see the company or a third party paid for the release"" .. Never do.",2019-08-03
