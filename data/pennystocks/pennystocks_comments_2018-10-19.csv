Low float means that the available stocks that are being traded in the market are low. So if a company has 90% institutional ownership that leaves 10% available to trade within the market. That makes a stock easier to go up and down. 

That's why you also have to look at technical charts and the volume of the stock to make that decision to buy or not.

A lot of people don‚Äôt seem to know who Medtainer is but they‚Äôre grinders are almost the equivalent of bic lighters where I‚Äôm from.

I use thinkorswim. It's TDAmeritrade's app and it's free, but you need to have money in your account to get ""live"" pricing (otherwise it's either a 15 or 30 minute delay). By money, I mean, like $25 or $50. It's kinda overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it and there's tons of tutorials and stuff. Before you know it, you'll be creating your own filters and scans and what not.

I tried eTrade's app, but scaling issues on my 4k monitor put an end to that (itty bitty tiny little fonts) and I didn't feel like trying to fix it.
