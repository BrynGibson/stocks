NORTHVALE, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / December 12, 2019 / Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Elite"" or the ""Company"") (ELTP), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing its own generic products, partnered generic products and proprietary abuse-deterrent opioids, today announced that it received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a generic version of Adderall XR￼, an extended-release mixed salt of a single entity Amphetamine product (Dextroamphetamine Saccharate, Amphetamine Aspartate, Dextroamphetamine Sulfate, Amphetamine Sulfate) with strengths of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg tablets.

Use something like interactive brokers, or google brokerages native to Belgium.

Leveraged ETF’s can be much riskier than stocks. Avoid when you’re staring out.

Theres 5 or 6 other generics out there with decent market shares and a name brand. If they see any profit it'll be late 2020 or early 2021.

Also..., anyday now Elite has a CNS drug to be approved by the FDA for 1.5 Billion.

I'll guess between now to March that this approval will happen.

In the long run Elite will use the increase in these revenues to launch their crowning jewel, (SequestOx)  opioid abuse resistance technology that is modular, and will fit with any opioid.

It has already passed all FDA phase testing, but is being held back due to the opioid toxic climate.

I'm not trying to hype this as an overnight success, but I do 100% believe in the management &amp; thier long term direction.

So my take away from all of this: Buy at 10 cents and hold for one year.",2019-12-12
