2,GermyBones,fa70j0g,/r/pennystocks/comments/e7wcfn/penny_stocks_presenting_at_ash_this_weekweekend/fa70j0g/,2,"I'm in for 1k shares of ATNM, slightly nervous about yesterdays lukewarm presentation, hoping today goes better. Have a small hint or SRRA which looms good, but then they announced an R/S by the end of the month üòê. Hopefully it'll bounce Monday and I can get my tendies and go.  Was like 15 bucks I had sitting in my account after the ATNM and ALEC bets, so it's not a big loss, anyway if it doesn't.

ALEC is promising, AbbVie partnership producing very promising results for Alzheimer's meds announced right before AH close Friday. Not a penny stock, though.",2019-12-08
