SEATTLE, Dec. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Baristas Coffee Company, Inc. (OTCPK:[BCCI](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4fhlOguM4YeK1rk0WVdr8q_TP7Z1hNGNh8gaJvc85dhsgyFAtHpEn_dOxXwrtHRwgXQ0yx1303LPjlSlszqDhFTk7FDHd66wStiYfb8FgifIxegNw62pbQzXKDTzlUPEB98fqm3YnmpfcxhR3KErOw==)) and Flower Power have partnered to bring high end CBD Coffee to the masses, launching Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD as the first of its new line of infused coffee that promotes healthy living.

Unlike early more primitive attempts by others who tried to use CBD oil to infuse coffee which separates and sticks to the cup, or hiding the CBD in sweeteners or other impurities, the Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD Coffee uses Flower Powers proprietary technology, introducing CBD to the beans after they are roasted.

The first production run of this ground-breaking Coffee by the two leading Coffee Companies is anticipated to be ready for consumers by year's end, allowing those who are making resolutions to consume CBD daily in 2019 to be able to kick off the year enjoying this truly special blend of coffee.

Advertising including the new Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD Coffee is in production and will begin airing coinciding with the product's availability. Baristas has had strong success having been featured in spots that have been seen kicking off NFL Monday Night Football, NFL Thursday Night Football, and the NFL London Game featuring Baristas White Coffee single serve cups.

During the 2019 Superbowl, a special set of ads introducing the new Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD Coffee will run throughout the day in and around the stadium before, during, and after the game and will include a special offer to send a message to the headlining halftime performer, currently expected to be Maroon 5. The spots will be seen on numerous digital displays including mobile devices allowing fans to connect via a special Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD Portal.

Barry Henthorn CEO stated: ""We are very pleased to be working with Flower Power the leader in CBD infusion in coffee, to bring the highest quality CBD Coffee experience to the daily lives of discerning consumers who seek the benefits of both coffee and CBD. We look forward to providing access to the combination of CBD, Caffeine, and other reported therapeutic properties while enjoying a first-rate cup of coffee.""

Richard Roocroft, Flower Power Head of Global Sales and Marketing, stated: ""Working with one of the best known coffee brands in America, Baristas Coffee, to create a product that will be able to help so many people navigate their daily lives is a big win for us at Flower Power. We are very confident in the quality of the product being produced and having the Baristas brand will enhance the adoption and credibility of CBD coffee on a global scale.""

According to data compiled by Transparency Market Research, the global CBD hemp market is projected to grow from¬†USD 950 Million¬†in 2017 to¬†USD 2.5 Billion¬†by 2026. The market is also expected to grow at a CAGR of 11%.
