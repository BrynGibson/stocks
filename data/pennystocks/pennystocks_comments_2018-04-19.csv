I went ahead and just bought 200 shares of AMD I'm going to let that shit sit for a while considering my swing trade strategy with penny stocks is not yielding me anything but loss. I have gotten countless ""pro tips"" in my inbox throughout the months that turn out to be nothing but people propagating their own pump and dump. Last year I made some pretty decent money off of PPHM before they got delisted from Nasdaq, also some decent gains from the NAKetship at the advice from the brave souls over at Wall Street bets before the knife fell. Until I find the time to either do some research of my own Orchid somebody's brain to pick that's not just propagating a pump and dump I'm just going to stick to my AMD and my once a month option calls.

32,Cosmokramer111,dxwpi9t,/r/pennystocks/comments/8deapg/tsxv_vgn/dxwpi9t/,1,may seem that way. But thats the way alot of these companies look.  I can assure you the Drone company they own is going into a killer farming season.  Partnered with Monsanto to provide drone capabilities to the climate platform. The cannabis company they own QCA has some phenomenal investments in the cannabis space.  Stock went on a huge run .17 - 1.20.  VGN got in at .20.  The gold companies on the other hands are where its out of my expertise.  ,2018-04-19
