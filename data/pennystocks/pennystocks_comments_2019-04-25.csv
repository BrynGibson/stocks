They‚Äôre so volatile and react so quickly that institutional traders will eat you up in the long run. I lost probably $5k before I learned my lesson. 

If you‚Äôre new and learning, invest in blue chip (mainstream) stocks for a while. Learn how it all works. Watch markets go up and down and start to understand why. You won‚Äôt strike it rich, but you won‚Äôt lose it all. Then maybe, MAYBE, explore options as a way to earn (and lose) faster. Again only with blue chips. Never average down, it‚Äôs a losing bet. Learn to cut losses and get out. Emotions are a hell of a drug.

Stop thinking there is some secret pipeline of news, it isn't news until its released to the public and by that time its priced in. Unless you're an insider or privvy to industry secrets, you'll never read something before the herd does. You gotta get in on rumours, get in on the expectation of news or results by a later date, a date you have something tangible to base your timeline off of, not a hunch of internet whispers. A div date, a conference announcement, a product hitting shelves, etc.",2019-04-25

98,Jubenheim,elto2br,/r/pennystocks/comments/bhfdmk/where_does_everyone_find_news_before_its_actually/elto2br/,1,"Very true. I will add that sometimes Twitter can be a primary source of news (in the case of Tesla and Musk's insane tweets) when you see an insider like a CEO tweet something, but analyzing that tweet and interpreting it into something tangible that you can base investments off of is something the average user will never be able to do, especially when compared to large institutions who hire high-priced analysts to understand the market and the news that surrounds it. 

For the average investor, honestly, just getting in on news stories is enough to make a profit off of, and even a good profit. I think these types of questions stem from the myth that there is some shady underbelly of news dissemination that allows certain investors to profit endlessly while the public gets screwed. 

In reality, the only people who do get screwed are those who don't know what they're doing or are victims of unforseen events, which happen to both institutional investors and amateur ones alike.

tldr; know what you're doing when basing your investment strategies and having the ""latest, hard-hitting news"" is not necessary",2019-04-25

108,amphetaminesfailure,elvcc3c,/r/pennystocks/comments/bhcr8c/krfg/elvcc3c/,1,"Oh yeah, Kistler definitely does.  I've seen the red flags here, but a lot of people are ignoring them.  A few people on twitter have posted some of their emails to him, and he is so unprofessional sounding.  He also always includes something to make you feel sorry for him.  A couple months ago he wrote he was having some ENT procedure done in the hospital.  Last month he was recovering from knee surgery.  Then he just had a grandchild born.....

What type of professional puts that information in emails to investors?  



On the positive side....

He has had a couple legit and successful RM's (maybe those were just luck though).  

And, the pump and dumps he's been involved in have all been pretty ""successful"" in terms of p&amp;d's.  A lot of these guys manage to only pump things up from trips to *maybe* a penny or so.  Kistler has managed with nearly all of his to get them to a nickel, dime, occasionally more.  

So I think no matter what this turns out to be...there's a profit for anyone who's already bought in as long as they know when to get out.  

My plan is actually selling around the same target you said, depending how it runs.    I know I'll at least dump half my shares around a few pennies.  The rest, we'll see.",2019-04-25
