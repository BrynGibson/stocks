They might not be a penny stock for long, as there is lots of hype developing and the stock broke records for its volume on the small NEO exchange in Canada.  Opened about $0.60 and down to $0.25 first day to end at $.41, then up to $0.97 and back down right now.  It is a legit company with shark tank Kevin O‚ÄôLeary backing it and ex canopy ceo Bruce Linton.  I am holding this stock for a few weeks at least, but probably would of been better to swing trade it.  There is going to be large swings for sure and it may be something to keep an eye on.",2020-03-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fexa41/mmedf_or_mmed/

16,HTBX - Monday (3/9/20) will be up,ff1756,dp79,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ff1756/htbx_monday_3920_will_be_up/,1,72,"Why I think Monday will be a good day:

1.	There‚Äôs a short sale restriction (SSR) Monday

2.	It‚Äôs a popular stock so there will be good volume with much less shorts occurring 

3.	The last time there was an SSR activated (3/4), the stock recovered FULLY from a really terrible day the day before

4.	The CEO is business/stock savvy. He put out a PR on 3/4 in conjunction with the SSR, which helped the stock price to recover. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he puts out a PR on Monday as well 

5.    The CEO‚Äôs total compensation is closely dependent on the stock. I think he‚Äôs motivated to keep the price at or above $1 for many reasons, and I believe he will be active with news this week and to keep the momentum going. 

6.	News outlets might catch onto the fact that what HTBX is working on for coronavirus actually prevents AND treats. It‚Äôs basically a vaccine (prevention) and drug (treatment) in one. This is HIGHLY UNIQUE!

7.	I think the other vaccine stocks are trading at their current peaks (INO, MRNA, NVAX) and are better candidates for shorting on Monday. I think the shorts will play over there especially with the SSR in place for HTBX. 

8.	There‚Äôs potential for a really nice short squeeze with all of the factors at play

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Why I think it will be good short term for the stock‚Äî there‚Äôs a lot of good news to report:

1.	Company could announce officially getting gov‚Äôt funding for the coronavirus vaccine

2.	The first patient enrolled in HS-110 ComPACT Phase 1 will be given the last dose on Monday (3/9). Phase 1 focused on safety so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see an update 

3.	PTX-35 is awaiting FDA approval and the start of Phase 1. The company stated it expected the FDA to approve in Q2

4.	Their biggest drug is HS-110 ImPACT which is in Phase 2 in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb. Results so far have been extremely positive, and it‚Äôs possible Bristol Myers could be a buyout candidate before Phase 2 completes since the results have been so good. 

This is based off my own research, and I thought I‚Äôd share. I highly recommend you do your own research and not make any crazy decisions based off of comments you see in forums (including mine).",2020-03-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ff1756/htbx_monday_3920_will_be_up/
