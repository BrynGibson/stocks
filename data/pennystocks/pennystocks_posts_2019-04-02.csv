**Initial Order from New International Police Services Customer for Guns and Ammunition Booked Through Lamperd Distributor Security PRO USA**   


SARNIA, Ontario, April 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Lamperd Less Lethal, Inc. (OTC PINK: LLLI), an innovation leader and manufacturer of advanced security solutions for law enforcement, military and security agencies worldwide, has just received a signed purchase order for guns and ammunition from an important new international police services customer. The value of this initial order for Lamperd products is totaled at $172,000 USD which represents the largest international order that the company has received to date. A substantial down payment has already been received by Lamperd. Further, there will be an associated training course for an additional fee as part of this order. The customer has also requested quotations on other Lamperd products which may be ordered subsequently.

Product order delivery is expected within the next several weeks with full payment due before shipment. This order will be shipped directly from Lamperd's manufacturing facility in Sarnia, Ontario to the customer's location overseas. There will be no need for any transit through the United States on this order which will reduce costs and regulatory compliance issues. 

This significant order was developed and booked by California based Security PRO USA (http://[www.securityprousa.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HifZkL9HHqgdL3JobrxW9PyerAU6bZ2u6rImEYSRB3TfUc_YyQieVZ2yN90jYiU3tVEy8kv-WVP1XMRYT_ymNnMvtWO-VQlSETcHAsIM0xY=)), one of Lamperd's newer distributors which came on in 2018. Security PRO USA is a very well established company with management and representatives who have extensive backgrounds and experience in the field of security protection on a global scale. Lamperd is extremely pleased to have a new working relationship with Security PRO USA which has now begun to yield tangible sales results that will benefit both companies as well as provide new customers with the finest less lethal solutions available today.    

Barry Lamperd, CEO of Lamperd Less Lethal, commented, ""Security PRO USA is doing an outstanding job in identifying and contacting new customers all over the world who are experiencing increasing needs for effective and safe Public Order tactical solutions including the guns and ammunition rounds which have just been ordered as a result of their efforts. We intend to further develop our marketing programs with Security PRO USA this year as they expand their efforts to bring in more clients and orders from their many established contacts around the world. We are also looking forward to Security PRO USA's marketing of Lamperd products in the United States where they are based since we are now setting up American Reserve Munitions, outside Boise, Idaho as the Master Distributor warehouse for direct shipment to US customers."" 

Hunter Solsona, EVP of Security PRO USA, stated, ""We are specifically recommending Lamperd Less Lethal products to many of our customers who are seeking the highest quality of manufacturing and design as well as accredited research reports to support the products' advertised specifications and capabilities. Very few other companies in field of less lethal weapons can deliver the level of effective, safe and certified  products and services which Lamperd can. We intend to introduce many more users of these products to the Lamperd solutions and look forward to a very successful marketing program with Barry Lamperd and his team.""",2019-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b8nyms/llli_lamperd_less_lethal_receives_172000_usd/

California’s Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting Compliance (METRC) requires technical expertise for growers to provide for a real-time tracking system for their cannabis inventory to comply with state law requirements. The Track-and-Trace system, or something known as “seed to sale,” is designed to track the movement of cannabis and cannabis products from the cultivator all the way to the retailer and on to the consumer.   


DeliverySwift’s technology offers the ability for delivery companies, dispensaries and growers to track their shipments in real-time and with specific ID numbers, or QR codes to any location utilizing the GPS function of the DeliverySwift platform.

M² Farms President Mario Martin stated, “We are extremely pleased to have found a single solution in DeliverySwift that keeps us compliant with all facets of California’s stringent track and trace laws. We can now confidently deliver our high-quality products knowing DeliverySwift has our back.”

CAMPBELL, Calif., April 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**KULR Technology Group**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=D6-vAvkYyQ-7rxRWLYlGvLXv9-XaWRMwrii94ggKbV55JucrnL3RC2yWXcu9JBQrWhld5FgroWTbXVwZ6w91kD8_Oi_NzETsQRJ4irFk5AjW7xmulPQK9mdE67LCx81uKlWLiSYcXNn4hMciKT1TJoTOclZxn6UoSJ2JO0Dz3IZ0wQXvdkj60hqosjSlUzfjZveyhRJYC76HrlVIe4S2-wUzUeIlGU9-jeDUF_JqKp5YfsID5qA_l-09cS63QRIC504LAGIyU2F0XpoP2HxP0mwaJUVLF1LTwq_OF3d9t3cVWb1CnTVd4QTlSD6-_Txvrrzsjb06-PqHhNv3Z0b8dw==), Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG), (the “Company” or “KULR”), issued its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Its Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mo, provided the following statement:  


To our shareholders:

**Financial Milestones:**

* For the year ended December 31, 2018, KULR generated $1,274,028 in revenues, an increase of 441% over 2017, and gross profit of $937,374, compared to $78,975 for 2017. Our 2018 revenue consisted of sales of our carbon fiber thermal management component products, Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) products as well as certain research and development contract services. The increase in revenue was due to new contracts entered into during 2018 as well as existing customers increasing orders.   
 
* Gross margin was 73.6% in 2018, compared to 33.5% in 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a more favorable product mix being sold in 2018. KULR earns greater margins in high performance component products compared to services and OEM products, so product mix plays an important part in our reported average margins for any period. Also, we are introducing new products at an early stage in our development cycle, hence margins earned can vary significantly between periods, customers, and products due to the learning process, customer negotiating strengths and product mix. The revenues for 2018 and 2017 were generated from 13 and 11 different customers, respectively.  
 
* For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, cost of revenues was $336,654 and $156,609, respectively, an increase of $180,045, or 115%. The increase was primarily due to increased volume of contracts in the 2018 period which required additional labor and materials. Net loss for 2018 was $2,058,239, a decrease of 15.2% from $2,424,510 in 2017.

We believe the growth of the E-Mobility market will continue to create significant new opportunities for the application of our technology and intellectual property (“IP”). The E-Mobility market consists of electrification of power trains with lithium ion batteries, vehicle management systems and the communications infrastructure to support the vehicles. These new opportunities will be further driven by certain behavioral changes we’ve observed in younger generations who seem to increasingly cope with higher population densities and prefer sharing services instead of ownership of products. We believe these technology and demographic trends will lead to new E-Mobility products and services in the future.

KULR will continue leveraging its heritage and expertise in high performance space energy management technology to develop solutions for E-Mobility applications. Our focus is to provide safety and energy management solutions for lithium-ion batteries in E-Mobility vehicles. We believe we are well positioned to serve customer specific needs and intend to expand our business through partnerships, IP licensing and acquisitions. In the case of acquisitions, we seek to acquire businesses that are synergistic and complimentary to our existing technologies, operations and management experience.

&gt;BEMG’S 2018 revenues increased almost 10%, from $962,997 in 2017 to $1,057,837. The increase in revenue is primarily due to execution of the Company’s business, sales and marketing plan, which nurtured a growing pipeline throughout the year which resulted in a large number of new partnerships and customers.
