That’s where I would stop my losses.
    I don’t have any news as of yet. But with some good news it could reach the the resistance of .055. Its first resistance to break is .0183. That will be a real good breakout point. Good luck",2019-07-22

any way here is the rumor, but its properly bullshit

&gt;Just got another internal update; and a press release is coming soon, certainly in July. It was considered 10 days ago but delayed in hopes of making it more robust. The long-term marketing effort continues to de-legitimize the current Asian shrimp supply - those shrimp will flat out make you sick if you eat enough. Meanwhile, the experiments with plasma continue and that plasma-infused water is being added to the tanks at La Coste. It certainly appears, in the early stages, that this plasma water will speed up shrimp growth, improve shelf life after harvest, and make a big dent in total EC process electricity. All of that means even more profitability - significantly so - for a functioning farm. As 2019 continues it will become established fact that current Asian shrimp farming is dangerously unhealthy, and the new SHMP alternative will be clean - both as to food and the environment, and also profitable. When the market accepts both of these facts; we might get another February SHMP storm.",2019-07-22

Most people lose cause they want fast money. Conversely don’t sit on fat gains and get greedy for more. Pump and dump, you aren’t in it for dividends so gtfo with upwards of 20 percent and then rinse and repeat. Do your research. Even with research it is speculative trading so you wanna limit as much risk as possible with research.",2019-07-22

What I didnt expect was for it to bounce back, today, as well as it has.

The expected selloff happened, and the stock is green. That's great. That said, now look for some consolidation until the next catalyst.
