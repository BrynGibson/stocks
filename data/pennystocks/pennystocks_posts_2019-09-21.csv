i cant understand why there is no information / post's/ other people talking about this sector which can yield insane amounts of money compared to other stuff that just seems pointless to me to invest in....if you look for the righ

if you can find a small cap oil / gas / mineral company, and you can see they have big potential and have good farm out deals / Ventures with Multi Billion Dollar company's, Covering all drilling and explorations costs...it has been a great way too make money and i dont get why there is no conversations about this sector.  ( Maybe  because they want too keep it on the down low) ... that would make me a idiot for talking about this and making a post about it. but i just dont get all the hate..... if you do some research into these small caps, you can find some amazing under valued company's. life changing money",2019-09-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d78mc9/energy_penny_stocks_have_returned_some_amazing/
