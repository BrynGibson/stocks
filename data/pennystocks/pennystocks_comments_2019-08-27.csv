It drops most all of the fundamental info you‚Äôll need to grasp trading and does so with clarity and in linear fashion so that it all makes sense as you go.

After that, I recommend studying Elliott Wave Theory, which is key for seeing the macro picture and price targets for SP movement. Avi Gilbert is an author on Seeking Alpha who puts out multiple articles and analyzing using that method, and as well has past articles to explain it and teach you how to use it to analyze for yourself.

If you want to understand options, check out option strategies insider dawt comm. It‚Äôs a free options education which also clearly explains options, how they work, and teaches you how to best apply various basic and advanced strategies to benefit you in differing environments.

For references on setting up and using ThinkOrSwim, how to setup and use stock scanners, find penny stocks, etc. I recommend EastSleepProfit on YouTube.

If you can find a way to acquire Tim Sykes DVD‚Äôs online for a reasonable price or through torrent, I would highly recommend them for learning the ins and outs of penny stocks, as well as his DVD‚Äôs done by Michael Goode discussing SEC filings so that you can research the fundamentals of stocks to help you see future trends in SP since there is key info in filings which will give you insight to a companies future growth / losses.

This is all a summary of the most beneficial resources I‚Äôve come across so far and have costed me very little comparatively to the gains they helped me achieve.

I highly implore you go through as many of these as you can and study them good before going into trading with more than a few hundred dollars. Using a small amount like $200 to help you apply what you learn as you go will help you get your hands dirty and hone in your trading skills while also testing the psychological affects of trading, but manage risk at a level that it doesn‚Äôt devastate you as you learn and make mistakes. 

You will make mistakes, so don‚Äôt be discouraged. The biggest key to being successful is managing your win to loss ratio at 2:1 (winning 66% of your trades made or more ideally,) and only risk 1% loss for every 3% in potential reward you see in a trade.

Glad to see you starting at 16, as I‚Äôm twice your age that and wish I would have started long ago when my living expenses weren‚Äôt a lot less to focus on it more intently and not having to work to fund learning and pursuing it as a career.

I definitely see the long term benefit and hopefully will continue to learn and get better and better. I have two questions for you. Roughly how much do you think you‚Äôve netted in your 7hrs and what was your largest years net?? I‚Äôm just curious what a successful traders idea of a good year looks like. Granted it‚Äôs a subjective idea. A college student would say a good year is 5grand where as my CPA is mad if he Doesn‚Äôt net 100K trading in a year.

When I became actively licensed at 21, I had 6 years in sales experience and had been pricing homes in the same market since I was 7 (my dad was an appraiser), and it still took 1.5 years for it to click. 2 years to make actual pipeline generation. 3 for the two to come together where business was steady and return/ referral business began flowing back in creating real volume. Almost the exact timeline as yours.

Information is also extremely expensive as well, let alone lead acquisition if you don't want to do so organically.

I‚Äôve been on the other side of the fence over the last 20 years, having started companies that went public then moved on to help over 150 public companies get their shit together in various capacities. 

I mean, yeah, having the means and the technical understanding are given prerequisites. But one has to develop a sense of intuition for the factors that exist around and in between the numbers. Is the company actually worth a shit? What‚Äôs the culture? How does it snap into its market? Is it doing so effectively? What drives leadership: ticker watching or running the company? What kind of money is already invested? Do they put out timely material news or bursts of immaterial fluff? Who‚Äôs making the market? Is the company capable of communicating its value in clear, consistent, and accessible terms? Does it look and feel professional?

I‚Äôve done in-person diligence on companies all over the world. I‚Äôve been fooled and I‚Äôve seen through foolishness. This shit is really difficult to read sometimes, and one has to understand what their gut is telling them despite what‚Äôs being put forth.
