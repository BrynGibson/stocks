&amp;#x200B;

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Oct. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -¬†HUTN Inc. (OTC:[HUTN](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/hutn)) announced today plans to issue a series of special dividends to its shareholders consisting of digital assets such as coins and tokens (collectively ""digital instruments"").¬† The first special dividend is expected to be announced by November 30, 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

In advance of each special dividend, HUTN will announce the specific details of the dividend as well as the dividend record date (DRD) and the dividend payment date (DPD).¬† Special Dividends will be paid on the DPD to all persons listed on the HUTN shareholder register as of the DRD.¬† Shareholders will need a digital wallet or digital account to receive these special dividends.

The purpose of this announcement is to allow shareholders time to prepare for receipt of special dividends by arranging for a digital wallet or digital asset account that can hold digital instruments.¬† EF Hutton Investments LLC, HUTN's investment advisor subsidiary, can provide an account that is designed to hold digital instruments. Shareholders interested in a digital asset account should contact EF Hutton Investments at¬†[info@efhutton.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S87TyTUunyyMov-Qx7YgAVxvCOSySR_IrB7azA725D6PQZ4H6HrKr71jepjfSmVpRs7x4fdbFJBWlKoQy82FKg==).¬†

For those shareholders who do not have a digital wallet or digital asset account at the time a special dividend is issued, the coin/token will be issued into a custodian digital account in the name of the shareholder and held until the shareholder is ready to transfer it to their personal digital wallet.¬† Shareholders have six months to notify HUTN if they decline to receive the digital instrument.

""Shareholders should be the first to benefit from any coins and tokens developed by our EF Hutton unit,"" said CEO Chris Daniels.¬† ""These special dividends are like an ‚Äòairdrop' of coins and tokens our shareholders.¬† The first such dividend is expected to be¬†iBTC¬†which is a version of Bitcoin built on blockchain technology.¬† The 'I' stands for ‚Äòinverse' because¬†iBTC¬†is designed to provide the economic inverse of Bitcoin (BTC) and therefore the use case for this coin is as a hedge to BTC."" ¬†¬†HUTN common stock trades under the symbol HUTN.

HUTN does not represent or warrant that any market for any of the instruments does or will exist at the time the special dividend is issued to shareholders nor that any market will develop after the dividend.¬† Shareholders and certain third-parties may have an interest in listing such instruments on an exchange.¬† Furthermore, HUTN intends to retain a portion of any digital instruments that are issued as Special Dividends.¬† Specific details, such as the number of coins or tokens per ¬†share of HUTN, will be provided at the time each dividend is announced.

Tax Treatment of Special Dividends  


This is not to be construed as tax-advice as each individual shareholder circumstance may differ and therefore shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisor.¬† Dividends consisting of crypto assets that are developed from the issuer's intellectual property would not be paid out of earnings and therefore are deemed a return of capital (ROC).¬† Any amount received as a ROC is to be taken as an adjustment in the cost basis of the shares; no taxable income is created with a ROC.¬† At the time each Special Dividend is announced, the announcement will include the value of the dividend so that stockholders can adjust their cost basis.

Over the past two weeks, WorkDone has appeared on two MoneyTV segments.¬†¬†The first, was to briefly introduce the AI and machine learning workforce automation startup to the market.¬†¬†[Today's segment was a full feature interview](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1knbgRT5773ijDRGJVHnIHyEJXoZdDJcpdEg3IhFe1JDwGMLmRfMIBcASL9nLEh_QhkK8HXbPr6pQSrL76MVzwT0ZM9IO526MPbufeWZEDfdLqAaoo5JlpgXlUcgX9RW)with MoneyTV host, Don Baillargeon and Joe Rogers, CEO WorkDone, Inc.¬†¬†During the different discussions, Mr. Rogers, took the opportunity to cover the company's business model, and how WorkDone's¬†[patent-pending and possibly, paradigm-shifting technology, would benefit all sized businesses, through self-automation and retention of operational best practices](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uLJ2uCLKxEXNGNR07zSAQOTZTSH-lYEQeog63pSsiblFhMJUj-8QMYFhwfCUJrLGtM-T3lIArtnmYbFRAztH1okQSTTYmLk2i2j5f0cTJXgrN6e_lro-G0bEb9UkdlheLw1XpZR-TJUUIJSsl2YGgSN7ZuOVMHalset_fDxfmGH1BQjMB8ysn0lUSOqRglDtSCLdt-kh5r2pCJtP50346WDdtvLZYFj4D9dPUuNDUgtA8F1k54oxDBOzahUurH6fAFKw0F6es0QkxmEHV6IYkE9IeujGjr52XL6H1Ocye6E-T-uhSHlQgOYeog9K2GCBopM9Aox0Z0dv554t0aRFRktNzry8TEnXkye1uzn5h3cr0ky_7jYMU3ItrHanuBNS4jyrYrRXovLtsjc7-8faEQ==).

Mr. Rogers also discussed the professional business relationship between the company and Digital Asset Monetary Network (OTCMKTS: DATI), as well as the benefits of raising funds on an equity crowdfunding platform like truCrowd, Inc.

Having reached its minimum funding requirement very quickly on truCrowd's equity crowdfunding investment portal, WorkDone is now accepting oversubscriptions and giving even more people the opportunity to own a stake in artificial intelligence.¬†¬†These types of fundraising methods were initially limited to accredited investors only. However, they are now available to everyday people, looking to acquire nominal to larger stakes in new business ventures.¬†¬†This means that businesses raising funds on equity crowdfunding platforms are actually able to get a more accurate assessment of investor sentiment, because they will have their business model validated by the public at large.¬†

Crowdfunding with truCrowd also creates a different type of opportunity not readily available for everyday people.¬†¬†By offering more than just shares in the company.¬†¬†People investing in WorkDone via truCrowd, will buy an investment contact that give the opportunity to¬†¬†receive a portion of the Company's revenue directly, in addition to an equity stake that they purchased.
