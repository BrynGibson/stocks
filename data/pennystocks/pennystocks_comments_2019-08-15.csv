The idea of P&amp;Ds is to load as much as possible, as low as possible, then once you've loaded the boat, start promoting it to your followers. This guarantees them crazy profits for little to no effort. 

They are typically very easy to identify but not always. Usually when I see a ticker being promoted, I'll look at the full chart. If it was chilling down at no bid or in trips for years, take a look at the volume during that period. If someone was picking up large chunks over the course of several months, then out of no where you see a huge spike, odds are it's a front loaded pump. They typically follow the same pattern (quick up and quicker down) but not always. It really depends on who is running the play. Some groups will avoid selling right away to lock in more profit (usually when they have a large chunk of the OS locked up within their group). Other groups will be dumping as soon as they put it up on twitter/discord. It comes down to know the group and how they manage their plays. Theres definitely money to be made if you trade them, but play for the 20-30% gains max. The multibaggers are only enjoyed by those that front loaded.",2019-08-15

So taking a long position is a company like that just doesn‚Äôt make sense most of the time. I use to buy pennies that were being pumped only to be left holding the bag when it dumped and I realized that this happens almost every single time. So I started shorting them when they are pumped and my win ratio basically inverted (was bad now good). My entry timing is off sometimes and I short before it‚Äôs done climbing but I swear 3/4 of the time or better they come back down near their pre pump price.

If one takes it as a putdown, that's on them. I presented the variables which I use to take valuations into account, and we disagree with those variables.

&gt;you're also putting down the companies themselves and those working for them.

This is a far reaching statement.

&gt;To say that no sub 50 cent stock has a real future is simply false and misleading.

I never wrote that. I'm arguing the valuation is likely not incorrect due to postulations having not been corrected overtime. In other words, a stock going from $7 to $0.40 had to go through a lot of investors and hope before it was determined to be valueless. While I'm not a fan of the *efficient market equilibrium hypothesis*, there is some merit to understanding the perpetual downswing that needed to be accounted for.

&gt;Literally just one example that says otherwise will shoot down the entire premise of your original post.

If I write a post about wanting to get struck by lightning. I point out the odds are very low, and are extremely unlikely to happen. However, if someone points out they've been struck, that doesn't falsify the general premise. Rather, it's an outlier on an already determined curve.

Calling people idiots for buying sub .50 stocks is the definition of an insult.  Don't get me wrong I'm not offended by any means and I don't really care myself, but just calling it like it is.

&gt; This is a far reaching statement. 

Not really, those working for these companies often times buy their own stock.  Even if they don't they are still working for a company that you're implying is a sinking ship.

&gt; I never wrote that. I'm arguing the valuation is likely not incorrect  due to postulations having not been corrected overtime. In other words, a  stock going from $7 to $0.40 had to go through a lot of investors and  hope before it was determined to be valueless. While I'm not a fan of  the *efficient market equilibrium hypothesis*, there is some merit to understanding the perpetual downswing that should be accounted for. 

Look at it like this... if you're making the statement that buying sub 50 cent stocks is an idiotic decision then by definition you are implying that all hope is lost in the company.  You can add a bunch of fluff and technical terms but you opened with ""don't buy anything less than 50 cents or you're an idiot.""  Your initial statement implies anyone investing in such a company is just throwing money away regardless of what you say next.

&gt; If I write a post about wanting to get struck by lightning. I point out  the odds are very low, and are extremely unlikely to happen, and how one  would need to be an idiot to hope for it. However, if someone points  out they've been struck, that doesn't falsify the general premise.  Rather, it's an outlier in a metric. If that outlier were to no longer  be an outlier, meaning the outlier is the new normal, the market would  correct itself; being a paradox. 

Doing research and selectively picking a penny stock from thousands of stocks and making a profit isn't luck or chance.  That's called DD.  Yeah penny stock investing sure is blind luck or chance but investing in large companies must be skill.

&gt; I'd happily discuss a stock you've invested in with DD behind it. 

Very well then.  Let's discuss $GMO.  Currently trading at around 20 cents a share.  It's a MOLY mining company that hasn't started mining. they have an 80 percent stake in the Mt. Hope mine in Neveda that is one of the largest and highest grade Moly mines in the world.  Said to contain over 1 billion pounds of Moly.

The asset value of this company far exceeds the entire valuation of the company.  They need a partner with deep pockets to help them build the mine (which costs around 700 million IIRC).  The top management have invested and bought many shares of the company.

It's a highly speculative play but if they ever actually start mining $4-$5 stock.  Also Mt. Hope isn't even their only asset just their flagship asset.  The risk/reward ratio justifies the investment, imho.",2019-08-15

Call them whatever you'd like. It would be a risky investment to chase an outlier. Imagine a dot chart. There being a cluster of dots in one area, and only a few outside of it. The outlier dots are the companies that were grossly-undervalued. Thus I call it idiotic to chase them given the odds being extremely low given undeterminable variables not present in SEC filings. If you and I disagree that the variables are in-fact determinable, then time will tell, only I won't have a vested interest in the outcome.

It doesn't sound like an investment, rather it's hope where you need to put your hands together and pray to god they get the mine. This presumes that even if they are able to mine, they'd be able to actually sell what they mine. As you called it, it'd be a ""highly speculative"" play given a potential lack of financial acuity. If the company wasn't able to make anything happen in the last 10 years, given several attempts to grow, why should someone believe it'll do it within the next year. http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=gmo&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=2&amp;show=&amp;time=13

I don‚Äôt usually have trouble getting filled or anything but they charge on a per share/lot size basis meaning the more shares you buy the higher the commission. I have paid $30 both ways to buy sell 1 stock using interactive brokers but with a flat rate it would only be $5/trade no matter what. If you focus on higher priced companies commissions are very low usually $1-3 range per trade.
