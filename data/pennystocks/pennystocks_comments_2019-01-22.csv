Cannabis can't be advertised as both recreational and medical. It's contradictory and unethical. It's like advertising percocets or morphine for fun. 

But that's hypocritical for me to say, because anyone with half a brain knows you can smoke a joint for fun.

But there's no money in that. The money comes for the mass public. 

Are people more accepting of medicine or fun? 

Is it easier to convince rich people that they were wrong their whole lives about ""weed"" where is it easier to come in some that they have recently discovered medical breakthroughs.

I only offer you this thought process when it comes to investing. 

That's why I stick to medical investments. ",2019-01-22

19,Krisforfun,eepodin,/r/pennystocks/comments/aimjej/canadian_penny_stock_picks/eepodin/,1,"I think AI will simply compliment these industries. 

Let's use Amazon for an example.

If Amazon partners with a digital health (healthspace or phgi for example), pharma AND medical cannabis, they could use AI (hypothetically) for sales.

Today in Ontario it's -30c. I personally know people over react when it's cold out, and they tend to feel ""sick.""

They could ask Alexa to give them to wait time updates at local doctors offices /ER / walk in clinics, and using some kind of tracking software (Google maps or Waze?) Predict if a potential ""customer"" we'll be heading out for an opinion. 

They could relay this using software like healthspace or phgi and simply alert local offices of a ""potential"" increase in customers. 

Let's say there is an increase in customers, the doctor's office can simply relay this information back to Alexa, which would help the system predict busy periods and build a database of information. 

Overtime you could potentially simplify it, by having an app that allows online care to track your visits with an online ""specialist"" that could partner with a delivery service like parcel Pal.

So here is a full rundown, based on a ""hypothetical"" situation.

Step A = your mother feels a little ""unwell"" and you ask Alexa/Google for some basic medical information

Step b - y = AI built over manually input information can predict the likelihood of what medication your mother may end up being told to take 

Step y = that information is automatically sent to amazon so they can prepare a shipment that may ""potentially"" go out.

Step z = once confirmation is done, they can rush that shipment ASAP to the customer using a service like parcelpal.

The good for companies like this is a smoke screen that they really care about their customers, and they really were urgent with their reactions to getting them the medication that they need. 

The truth is it's just information built up over time that the computer generates over assumptions calculations while accounting for exceptions to the rule.

Now obviously I could be way off on this, because I'm not a professional. But if I wanted to put my competition out of business, this is exactly what I would be doing right now. 

There's reasons billionaire big companies are partnering with really small companies like this, in my opinion. 

It's a small risk with a huge reward. Get it to ""work"" and you can buy them for a billion dollars while earning 100 billion in a couple years. ",2019-01-22

21,fishfetcher_anaconda,eeprc5u,/r/pennystocks/comments/aimjej/canadian_penny_stock_picks/eeprc5u/,1,"I actually do not think you are ‘way off’ at all. 

The future is bright and the times where typing website urls, filling out online forms and using current physical entry methods might be coming to an end soon.

In the short term, IMO, the market might need AI market battle to see who leads in developing the most streamlined AI for each industry, banking, medical, entertainment and so forth.

I feel that in the long term the next AI will interlay Alexa, Cortana, Siri, Erica, Google Assistant and other “in-house” AIs so you can deal with only one. 

Projects like Singularitynet or one of the fittest currently “in-house” AI such as Alexa will take over every other one IMO.  I lean towards the latter.

IMO pretty much all websites will work with one or two AIs as markets like variety but not choice paralysis and, also, the customer wants product delivery asap and does not care for AI identity.

I mean, huawei can fight Google but what's the point? Better to work together. Same with Amazon, Facebook, Walmart.
