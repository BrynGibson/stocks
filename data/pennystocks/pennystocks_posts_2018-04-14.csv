1,Weekly Cannabis Stock Breakdown 4/13/2018 update,8c6g89,amenai09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8c6g89/weekly_cannabis_stock_breakdown_4132018_update/,0,0,"In this video, https://youtu.be/0uEbuQw_zmE

2,How am I supposed to make money?,8c717o,jogle8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8c717o/how_am_i_supposed_to_make_money/,46,39,So I haven't invested anything into penny stocks yet I've just been analyzing a lot of charts n reading up on strategies and such and I'm just wondering why it seems like all the real money always gets made pre and post market.
