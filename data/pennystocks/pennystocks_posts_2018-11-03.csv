3,$PTNYF great read from another source,9twff7,capitalgrowth,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9twff7/ptnyf_great_read_from_another_source/,1,4,"Patience is paramount

I for one Concur these sentiments. 

I've been adding to a substantial sized position almost weekly and on every solid news release showing another Revenue stream.  I don't wanna check my investment one weekend and see PKG.c at $1.00 and have to pay triple when I can still buy it under .50   ( I've made that error a few times on fundamental, solid, revenue generated companies.) 

The Astute investors are realizing that Parcel Pal has advanced in leaps and bounds in the last 10-12 months alone.  They will take the traders and the sellers out faster than one might think.  Parcel Pal has hit every catalyst and milestone.  Far more than anyone had hoped or predicted.  Huge Companies are constantly contacting Parcel Pal for delivery contracts now that expansion has started.   

Parcel Pal can provide delivery service and provide logistic delivery issues for Any Company , Not just the MJ space which is only one avenue. ( a massive one ... but Only one avenue)

If any Bigger Boxchain Company for example like a Costco, Walmart, Save on Foods, Safeway, M&amp;M stores, Liquor Store Chains, etc etc etc.  Then this company is off to the Races.  Revenue for Parcel Pal will double, triple etc faster than most will even apprehend.

Choom ( CHOO.c ) contract alone that Parcel Pal just announced will provide a massive increase in Revenue.  Add the Amazon ( AMZN) contract for the US in Washington and it doesn't take a Genius to know where Parcel Pal ( PKG.c) is headed.

My wife loves this company.  It's not only for companies, but individuals as well.   She has used PKG.c  to pick up laundry at the dry cleaners, Wine for dinner parties, Documents from other businesses, tickets for a charity event and numerous other examples.  I had her use Parcel Pal to pick up Hockey Tickets from a colleague as I had a delayed flight.
  

Parcel Pal....."" Buys her TIME "" and is inexpensive and cost efficient.  Her friends and family are all using the App.  

When I read back some of the posts here, I realize that only about 10% are understanding the Massive Potential for this company.  Most are jibberish posts.  Time is worth money to me so I have a few on Ignore.     Lots of Quality Posts to counter the rubbish ones.



Parcel Pal  is Only getting Started.  Just out of the Gate and Off to the Races.

cheers
