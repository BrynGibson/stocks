I think the way to think about it is as open and close. When you open a put option at a strike price you are saying it will reach that price or lower. Then when the day you set hits you are closing it and you make money for however much lower than it was when you opened it.

42,truthlesshunter,fktqppf,/r/pennystocks/comments/fki07d/this_is_a_thread_for_people_to_ask_about/fktqppf/,1,"I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you asking why is there a ask/bid on a certain strike price for a put?   
    
If you're looking to buy a put, then you're going to look at the ask (probably). You put the price you want to pay (premium) PER SHARE. So if you buy 1 put contract, that's 100 shares.    
   
Example. The price of stock AAA (made that up, not really hehe) is $10 right  now.  There's a put contract at $9 for this friday. The ask/bid is $0.40/$0.75. That means that people who want to buy that put are asking $0.40, those that want to sell it is $0.75. You'd be on the side to buy the put. If you buy the put, that means you'll want to short the stock at the strike price on the expiry date.    
   
Let's say you believe the price of the stock will be $8 for friday. The ask $0.40...you want to guarantee that you get the contract and you ask $0.50. It sells to you at that price. You paid a $50 premium and you now have the put contract ($0.50x100 shares, 1 contract). Friday comes and the price is very well $8. You exercise the option, short 100 stocks at $9, then able to buy the stock price at $8. You've made $50 net, without transaction fees (You shorted 100 shares at $9 as per your contract..and you're able to buy 100 shares at the stock price of $8...so that's $100, 100 shares at $1, minus the $50 premium you paid for the put contract originally).   
    
I hope that helps",2020-03-18

Sell put: you’re selling to the buyer of the put option, you can’t choose to exercise, stock will go up



When you sell a call or put, you’re potentially risking a lot of money as the buyer can exercise the stock at the strike price especially if you’re out of the money. So you get paid for taking in this extra risk in contrast to the buyer, who’s paying the seller so that he can choose to exercise the options. 


Also, all you really need to memorize is that buying calls means you think the price will go up. Now there are two pairs of opposites: buy/sell and call/put and 4 potential outcomes. All you need to remember is that changing from buy to sell OR call to put just means the you think it will go down. If both are opposites, then it’s the same direction you want. For example I know that buying PUTS (not calls) or SELLING (not buying) calls means that you think the price will go down, but if you’re BUYING PUTS, you think it’ll go down.",2020-03-18

But from what I remember, Inverse ETFs are essentially a bet on whether or not something will rise or fall. So in this case, when you buy into JNUG, you're saying ""I think gold is going to do really well"". Meanwhile with JDST, you're saying ""I think gold isn't going to do very well"". Consequently, when JNUG falls, JDST rises, and vice versa. JNUG will fall when the value of gold declines, because it means the bulls were wrong.

Calls if you think price of stock will go up.
Puts if you think price of stock will go down.
Strike price is the price you think it will cross (get close to), for calls you hope the stock price to go above it, for puts below.
The date you buy it for is the date it will exercise (you either buy or sell the stocks)
Best way to go about it is to buy then sell your options, don't exercise. Farther out you go from today's date, safer it is. If the stock is red today, calls will be cheaper, if the stock is green today, puts will be cheaper.

I started trading options this week and I've doubled my money so far. Haven't locked in profits cause my puts have some time on them but will probably lock them in tomorrow, expecting a Friday rally so I'll buy more puts then and hold onto them over the weekend. You don't have to have the strike price anywhere near the actual price, you make your profit and sell it.

They market a system to mass produce vaccines. That's not the hard part. The hard part is actually finding your antigen and turning it into a safe and effective vaccine. 

IBIO is to vaccines as Foxconn is to the iPhone. Everyone here is focused on the iPhone but they don't realise they aren't buying Apple. On top of this, IBIO is unproven. Not only would they need a validated CoV vaccine (something they aren't working on and don't have the expertise make), they'd also need to validate the IBIO method for ""farming"" the antigen. 

They have decent tech, but it's useless without a vaccine, and they aren't working on the vaccine. 

I could go on for days about other red flags but suffice to say, this company is using the pandemic to raise capital with no hope of actually producing something for this specific virus. They're just pumping the stock so they can keep the lights on in the years to come until their method is validated and they partner with someone who has an actual vaccine to produce.

""to open"" or ""to close"" is about the contract. So if toy sell to open, you're selling shares on an option (whether it's a put or a call). Same thing with buy (buying an option). To close means that you decided to rebuy or resell the option. This closes the contract. What that means is that if its covered (I. E. You already had the shares), you regain control of your shares (because you can't sell your shares if they are part of a covered option that's been transacted). If you didn't have shares and you closed the option, that means you won't be forced to buy them upon the contract being exercised.",2020-03-18
