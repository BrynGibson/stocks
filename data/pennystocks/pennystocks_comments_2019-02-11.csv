Let's say it's not. What is going to be your trade plan so you don't get hosed like cryptos? 

[SPWRF is losing money](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SPRWF/financials). With so much competition it is really tough to say who the long-term leaders will be. There is no assurance they will ever make money. 

At this point in the Cannabis game, with zero experience trading OTC's you may want to look into the MJ etfs that track the entire sector. HMLSF, SEED.TO, MJ, plus the new ones filed in January including YOLO (not yet trading).   

Will they double your money tomorrow? No, but those early days are over anyway. It will take time to see how the market plays out long-term. ",2019-02-11

The company has $17,000 in cash and has never sold its product. 

The address listed on their last 10-Q doesn't have a street number, just the 2 crossroads. 

They use convertible notes to stay in business meaning the pump is probably to help the guy who converted the note to shares be able to sell out. 

Red flags, but knowing its a pump it can still be trade-able if you look at it as such and not as an investment. ",2019-02-11

But it just never stopped climbing; all the way from when I initially started watching it (around .002, up until this day actually) but the history just scared me too much and I had a nice profit, so I sold. It kept climbing amd I bought in again for 20k shares this time, but at .04 and I missed the .10 it jumped to one day and it dropped back down to .06. I said to myself that if it hits .08, then I’m selling. So I set my limit at .081 and it sold but it also finished the day at like .12. EVERY SINGLE DAY last week I kept waiting for a decent drop to buy back in but that never freaking happened. Has been climbing by .10-.20+ every damn day. I could be sitting approximately $30k richer right now from my original purchase. But probably more because I would’ve kept buying in. But I still look at the bright side.....

I think it'll take a while for the market to realize the value this company holds. There are a few cons to buying this company. One of which is that it trades OTC, and big institutions aren't going to buy up OTC stocks. It has to reverse split and trade on NYSE or the NAS before the real money starts to come in.

The earning power this company has in the future is tremendous if they take advantage of the patent. This vibrio suppression technology allows them to grow an insane volume of shrimp indoors 365 days of the year. Instead of importing 2 week old frozen shrimp from India and Indonesia like restaurants are doing now, SHMP can build facilities right outside metropolises and have fresh fish trucked in the city same-day as harvesting.
