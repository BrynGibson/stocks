If no one will buy them, you can try contacting investor relations. I've done this before, they're generally really helpful / responsive and might be able to provide a solution. I've never done this for an illiquid position though. 

Or buy enough puts in it so that if it does drop you have a contract that gives you the right to sell your shares. 

Or sell calls on the stock so that if it does go up someone can exercise your calls, you keep the premium paid for the option, and you're out with a decent gain.

I would also consider calling a bank, like TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, E Trade, Goldman Sachs. Etc. They love making deals. I had some puts once that raised so much in value I was worried no one would buy them so I would have to exercise them but I didn't have $2.3M to buy the shares, i contacted a bank to have them lend you the money and so I could exercise them in the event that they were sellable. Ended up being sellable thankfully because FB has so much volume. 

But there are ways, just gotta know that these banks love making deals. 

You could also talk to your broker about a peer to peer transaction, you find someone who wants to buy the stock from you and they set up the transaction.

If you're only down $20k out of $150k then I would hold (depending on the stock). That's just how it goes, the long hold principle of equity is that stocks are more likely than not to recover from a loss over time.

Not a financial advisor, but I trade and work in the business to an extent.",2018-07-27
