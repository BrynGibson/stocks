Because of that, any hint of weakness will cause the stock to plummet. Especially when the only reason it's up is from others greed.

If we look at the results of phase 1 I think it was, it went from 11 cents to 17 before results, spiked to 79c then settled in the 40s. So I don't think it's out the question for it to spike above 1 dollar.
