So if you somehow have enough info to be sure the company isn't a scam, and you see it's very undervalued, it might be a good opportunity.  The market will eventually catch up.

But you're right, options jump more than the pennies most days.  And options give you the ability to bet on a company that you've heard of (or the market in general) and give you the ability on it going up or down.  If I find an OTC stock that's surging and I think it's a scam there's no real way for me to bet on it going down.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think any brokers allow a short sale of OTC stocks.  So I've abandoned pennies really since I've gotten into options.",2018-05-16
