Looking at the 20Y/1M chart view, the price seems to be making a bit of a recovery as it has increased about 29% since last month. The 1Y/1W seemed to be onto something but has since retrieved 14.28% this past week from the previous week's close of 0.7333/share. Looking at the 1Y/1D, I see potential and the stock is currently still trading above my trendline. It's also trading close to the lowest bollinger band on the 1Y/1D, but I'll just be watching for now. One off day, and I'd cut the losses with it.",2019-07-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cg1oga/pixy/

The 20Y/1M chart seems to have met resistance, the 1Y/1W chart has been tanking, but 1Y/1D chart is where I'm starting to see potential.  It tanked until it hit support at around $0.212, and now it has been trading flat. Not gonna buy into it just yet because anything can happen, but I will be watching for a good time to possibly purchase within these coming days depending on how the intraday views are looking. If it breaks the $0.212 support though, I'm taking it off of the watchlist. The 1Y/1D RSI is also pretty low at about 39, and the price is currently sitting below the lowest bollinger band, so to me, it looks like an oversold stock. The question is... will it go up or down?",2019-07-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cg1dc4/kblb/

5,TTCM: Concern posited to David LaMountain,cg0xfn,Anarkrist,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cg0xfn/ttcm_concern_posited_to_david_lamountain/,25,17,"I'm on the ARKnet FB group, where this morning someone posited an area of personal concern, long term, for the ARKnet application and it's long term usage prospects. Below is the concern, and a response from one of the developers and TTCM investor relations front man David LaMountain:

Concern:

""I'm an investor. I have a lot of love for this tech. It has some serious potential, and I'm holding because of this.

That said, I have serious worries about this tech being ""before its time"". The biggest hurdle for most applications is moving out of the niche or curiosity markets and into the mainstream. That is where true (and sustainable) parabolic growth lies. Sure, many may download this app, but how many will find it practical. My concern lies in the interface: your phone. This tech screams for a more practical interface, one that allows the user to interact with these ARKs without being tethered to the phone. It screams for Google Glass or some other new tech that allows the user to meaningfully interact with the contents as they would any other outside of cyberspace. Without this, my vision is blurry as to whether or not the mainstream will view this as anything more than a curiosity.

Further, imagine driving down the road, and instead of billboards, you see ARKs. This is not possible if your method of interaction is the phone, and that is EXACTLY what 100% of the user base will be using. No one is walking down the road holding up their phone (with every step) to view the world in which they are interacting. No one. The interface needs to be easy to use, unobstructing to a person's interaction, and stylish. Computerized car windows and windshields, glasses, eye implants, etc.

Is this in the works? Partnerships, buyouts, whatever...I feel like this tech, which I LOVE, is crippled, from launch, with a predefined ceiling without some kind of plan in place to move the user into a simplistic interface with these ARKs.

Furthermore, if the tech is coming, through partnership or otherwise, the user must be able to control, through filters, the ARKs that he or she sees...

Thoughts? Comments? Additions? Concerns?""


Response from David LaMountain:

""Chicken or the egg conundrum. ARknet is the first application which is not a game that could potentially provide the first ever mass market for AR hardware.. mass adoption will lead to a flux of development companies bringing more and better AR hardware to the mass market.. AR is the future, Facebook and some other platforms are falling, privacy issues and content ownership are becoming front and center, blockchain / crypto are spreading and then... enter ARknet.""

David LaMountain is also on record last week saying that the release of the ARKnet 1.0 application on iOS and Android is a matter of ""days"", not weeks.

A little DD done by me that I thought some here may have interest in. I am invested in TTCM and have a side position that I am daytrading, just for full disclosure, and, yes, this is a pump, but not for a dump. I'm in for the long haul with my core.",2019-07-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cg0xfn/ttcm_concern_posited_to_david_lamountain/
