Still on the watch list and still seeing 100 million plus shares traded. I always consider it a good morning or overnight play if it finishes near the high of the day. Company continues to get rid of debt and is waiting on trial information. Did not even try to slow down by the end today so it will be fun to see how it works out. Broke huge resistance level. 

GOHE is another multiday OTC runner that just seems to go up. But now we are starting to see that it may start a crack down. Will be interesting to watch tomorrow as it topped out mid day and volume at close was lower. 

PHOT is one of those new hot Marijuana stocks that is taking legs again and just ran today. Do not know what will happen to it but it broke out very well and many run more. 

EBIO is another being if it isn't broke do not fix it. Been on the watchlist a number of days simply because it just moves and the chart is nice. Always seems to be a safe overnight and that is why it was on my overnight watchlist most days. 

VATE I care less about but will watch if it bounces off 0.06 or not which it may and go back up. Slow for now. 

SSOF found some legs and ran once again. I could see it being a dip buy tomorrow. We will see as it may go down mid day. 

DPW is the safest overnight if you can afford 3-5% gains. Just have to be quick and intraday it is garbage. ",2018-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ehryt/stocks_to_watch_for_tuesday_and_overnights_celz/

FUSZ\- Pull back yesterday but the pump is strong here.  I'm guessing a little more consolidation but I think there's something goin on in Vegas this week \(just saw some of the pumpers tweeting about it\)

BKPPF \- blockchain/bitcoin stock holding a channel between 0.50\-0.57. Arbitrage in Canada is holding things up here IMO but lots of action ""up north"" makes me think that this is far from done.

CELZ \- Volume is still strong here, wouldn't be surprised to see a continuation and then maybe consolidation later in the week to new higher support

They really start presenting at their conference for the first time tomorrow. This is usually a good indicator it gets hyped up and hence a little spike. Overnight charts are good but I would not touch until last minute. Tomorrow night especially I think it will be a great overnight play https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dpw-participate-planet-microcap-showcase-103000551.html

CELZ is usually a good play for a morning sell into a spike and almost always goes well above close within 30 minutes of open the next morning. Still seeing high volume. 

GNIN saw high volume today and began its breakout. Looks interesting for sure but do not know what to make of it. ",2018-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8en2k6/overnight_for_424_dpw_is_best_celz_is/
