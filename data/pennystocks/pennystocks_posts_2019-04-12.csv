$BIOAQ BioAmber ran a Bio-Succinic Acid plant built in 2015 for $140M. Bio-SA is a building block chemical derived from feedstock fermented by patented yeasts.

The company filed for Ch 11 (5/8/18), which was later dismissed and filed as Ch 15 with CCAA as foreign main proceedings, PWC overseeing as court-appointed monitor.

This plant supposedly sold for $4.3M in CCAA (Canada) proceedings (10/22/18).

Fair market value of the plant in liquidation scenario appraised at CAD $70-$95M per Nexant (5/22/18, appraisal ordered by PWC).

[https://www.theobserver.ca/news/local-news/sale-of-sarnia-bioamber-plant-completed](https://www.theobserver.ca/news/local-news/sale-of-sarnia-bioamber-plant-completed)

&amp;#x200B;

Although the plant sold, the transaction remains ongoing. The court ordered stay has been extended multiple times despite transaction closing almost 6 months ago.

[https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/insolvency-assignments/bioamber/court-motions-and-orders.html](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/insolvency-assignments/bioamber/court-motions-and-orders.html)

&amp;#x200B;

..it's starting to look like a two-step acquisition via IRC Â§368(a)(1)(D) in order for the acquirer to utilize tax attributes.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368)

&amp;#x200B;

Both PWC and Blakes (BioAmber's Canadian legal counsel) have named this transaction a restructuring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of reasons why shares may stay alive :

$320M in NOLs

$77.6M in deferred tax assets (2017)

&amp;#x200B;

A 15 year off-take agreement with Vinmar worth $3B

An agreement with CJ Cheljedang retrofitting existing plants and contemplating a (70/30) JV with future plants.

&amp;#x200B;

Licenses &amp; Agreements required to run the plant and fulfill off-take agreement are tied to BioAmber Inc. ($BIOAQ)

&amp;#x200B;

The purchaser (a JV between LCY Chemical &amp; Visolis) also purchased the plans &amp; permits for a second plant which require said licenses &amp; agreements.

&amp;#x200B;

LCY Chemical was just acquired by KKR for $1.5B on 1/31/19.

[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2019/01/31/2003708947](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2019/01/31/2003708947)

&amp;#x200B;

Visolis was seeded by Royal DSM, and retains a branch office on the same campus as DSM.

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely KKR is providing financing for $BIOAQ restructuring and future plants in order to expand their recent acquisition of LCY Chemical.

&amp;#x200B;

Very big names in the mix: KKR, LCY, DSM, Cargill, Vinmar, CJ Cheljedang

Total lottery play but the more I read, the more I like the odds.
