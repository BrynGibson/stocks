We plan to keep this expansion paralleled with Canada. **California has very big opportunities for us, keep an eye out for news.**  


**We are aiming to partner up with one of the major LPâ€™s in Canada.** We have had conversations with a few players, but I cannot comment further than that.  


**Anytime I enter a new market, to lower capex, I always wish to have partnerships within that region**. The cannabis market needs a reliable and innovative distribution partner, so are expecting this to be a large growth catalyst for our national expansion strategy.  


Weâ€™ve aimed ourselves at the medical space to start, **and weâ€™re now taking the proper steps to position ourselves for the opportunities that are present within the recreational space.** Â 

From a market perspective, I believe the focus has been on cannabis producers and **I think the market will switch to looking at ancillary businesses that support production and distribution.**

We for our customers, **we will be doing some very innovative things moving forward.** We are aiming to handle all fulfillment requirements for Choom, **we will have more news about this in the future**.  


**We do not have any plans to raise capital in the near future**. As I move into new markets, our strategy is to mitigate any spending on unnecessary marketing by forming strategic partnerships.  


Actually too many things to name...
