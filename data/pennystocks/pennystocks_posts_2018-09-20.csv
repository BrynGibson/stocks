I have other stocks with Merrill Edge that are not penny stocks, but I would like to be able to buy and sell penny stocks without this kind of bullshit. I have approximately $15K in penny stocks.

I really don't want to have to sell with Merrill and then rebuy with a different brokerage. I want to transfer with the same cost basis that I have using Merrill.

According to LKA's President, Kye Abraham, ""*So much of our time and effort is focused on details of the mine's commercial production and our exploratory efforts, that we've neglected to discuss this property's truly remarkable history. It still amazes me after all these years….nearly 36 years since we started on this quest.""*

**About LKA's video, ""The Greatest Treasure Hunt In The West.""**The information contained in the video is believed to be accurate based on historical records and current documentation but does not purport to be a complete or comprehensive history of the Golden Wonder Mine. Regrettably, the involvement of several persons and companies who made substantial contributions to the property's development were not mentioned due to production script and time constraints. Any questions should be directed to LKA.

Mining and related activities are inherently high-risk endeavors and there can be no assurance that LKA will be successful. Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Bespeaks Caution Doctrine.* *Investors are cautioned that the Company continues to generate substantial losses and additional funding and exploration work is required.

Weissberg is joining the Medical Advisory Board and has also signed on as a Private Label customer.

Dr. Weissberg stated, “I’m very pleased to join the Medical Advisory team, to both collaborate on new products and explore the benefits of CBD for patients. To date, I have used this product on both myself and dozens of my patients and have been very satisfied with both the potent non-narcotic pain relief it affords my patients as well as the low risk of adverse side effects commonly seen in both traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotic medications. CBD has very potent anti-inflammatory properties bringing down the swelling, stiffness, and warmth seen in arthritic joints and post-traumatic injuries. I believe that many physician specialties will find good indications for its use making it a very affordable and safe medication without the high risks associated with traditional prescription drugs. Additionally, Chiropractors who are unable to prescribe medications will be able to offer this over the counter medication for their patients who frequently suffer from both post-traumatic and neurologic injuries. The research and results thus far are very compelling and I’m excited for the prospects these products will offer for a variety of ailments. I will strive to help the Canbiola team put the best products possible on the market for both consumers and patients”.

Marco Alfonsi, Canbiola CEO, stated, “We are continuing to execute our plan to strengthen not only our Medical Advisory Board but also our distribution network. With the addition of Dr. Weissberg, we have added the 8th doctor to our Medical Advisory Board. I believe this addition will benefit our product development, to have true medical experts advise and offer input as we develop new products is an invaluable resource. Coupling the continued and increased acceptance of CBD with our development of new products for different uses will continue our growth and sales while expanding our client base. At Canbiola we are building an extraordinary team, and look to be an industry leader going forward. My enthusiasm for our future and the direction of the industry as a whole is very strong, I want to thank our team and shareholders for their support.”

Dr. Weissberg joins a growing all-star medical advisory team that already has the following members:

IntelGenx Signs Letter of Intent with Tilray® to Enter Into a World-Wide Agreement To Produce Cannabis-Infused VersaFilm™ Products
SAINT LAURENT, Quebec, Sept. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IntelGenx Corp. (TSX-V:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (“IntelGenx”) today announced that it has executed a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) (“Tilray®”), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution, to co-develop and commercialize oral film products infused with recreational and medical cannabis (“cannabis-infused VersaFilm™”), in anticipation of amended cannabis regulations which would allow adult-use consumers to purchase edible products.  

Pursuant to the LOI, subject to entering into a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, IntelGenx and Tilray will fund 20% and 80% of the costs associated with the development of the cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ products, respectively.  IntelGenx will have rights to manufacture and supply the co-developed products to Tilray, and will also receive a fixed single-digit royalty on net product sales.  Tilray will have the exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the co-developed products.

The LOI also contemplates that, at the time of entering into the definitive agreement, Tilray® will make a strategic investment in IntelGenx by way of a non-brokered private placement (“Private Placement”).  Tilray® will purchase 1,250,000 common shares of IntelGenx at a price of USD$0.80 per share, which is equal to the five-day volume weighted average closing price of IntelGenx’ common stock on the OTCQX for the period ended September 18, 2018.  IntelGenx intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ product development in connection with the LOI.  The Private Placement will be subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.

“Our proprietary VersaFilm™ drug delivery platform offers a number of proven advantages - including increased bioavailability, precision dosing, accelerated onset of action, reduced side effects, child-resistant packaging and easier, more discrete administration - all of which we believe have the potential to improve the way people may use and experience cannabis in the future,” said Dr. Horst G. Zerbe, President and CEO of IntelGenx.  “This LOI marks the first step in forming an exciting partnership with Tilray®, a global leader in the medical and recreational cannabis industry.”",2018-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9hh757/huge_news_igxigxt_teams_up_with_tilray/
