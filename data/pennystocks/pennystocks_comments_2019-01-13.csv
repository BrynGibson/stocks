Unless I'm mistaken all water is hydrogen infused (H2O) and that's 3 miligrams of cbd. Even if there is some sort of special hydrogen technology he has people hyped over some pricey water. This dude could sell ketchup popsicles to women wearing white gloves.",2019-01-13

Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&amp;C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because both CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary supplements. Under the FD&amp;C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these into the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement that we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active ingredients in any drug.

The FDA will continue to take steps to make the pathways for the lawful marketing of these products more efficient.

Pulled form the same article sighted above. It is my understanding from everything Ryan has stated, they are doing everything in their power to get it FDA approved. ",2019-01-13
28,Chad1eycooper,ee1u4b7,/r/pennystocks/comments/afjadn/matt_davis_hiph_hype/ee1u4b7/,1,"There is definitely a lot going on in the statement. Those pathways are described as clinical studies. What cannabis derived compounds they are referring to seems to be ingredients such as hemp oil. So I’m not saying that CBD drinks are impossible and rule them out but I am saying there is a ton of hoops to jump through and they will be a burden for companies. Lots of money and time will go into hoping the product gets approved. Now that CBD and THC are “drugs” they are going to be under crazy scrutiny and the FDA will want certain criteria to be met. For example HSGX is down %70 or more simply because they can’t get through FDA approval. These are apples and oranges in some ways but it shows how easily a company can spend all their resources on getting a product approved by the FDA. 

This is just my understanding of what I read and in no way am I saying my thoughts are definitive. I’m just reading and making assumptions. I like that we can have a conversation and reach a deeper understanding. I think that’s what’s so great about Reddit. ",2019-01-13

“Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective.
