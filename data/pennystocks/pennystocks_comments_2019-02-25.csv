But at the same time, if you've got cash you can play around with and lose without hurting your financial status....it's not that *hard* to make money on penny stocks.  

If you learn your fundamentals when it comes to the market in general, and with otc stocks specifically, then you do your research thoroughly, on this sub, on twitter, on ihub, on yahoo, barchart, etc. etc....you can turn 10 or 15 grand into a 100 grand plus.  

I'm a ""new trader"".  But I've already made decent money, and I'm expecting to do even better on a few current positions.  

The people who bitch about not making money here are the ones who don't do their DD, or if they do, just don't have enough ""play money"" in their savings to risk.  

I got in at SHMP at .03ish.  I got out at around .70.  My initial investment was $2k.  

I only had a month of actual trading experience at the time, but I had been researching and learning for a while.  And more importantly I had the disposable income.  

I have a coworker who bitches about the money he makes trading otc, but at the same time won't even put in more than a hundred dollars or so per stock.  That includes sub pennies.
