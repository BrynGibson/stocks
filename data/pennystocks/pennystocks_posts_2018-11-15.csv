$TNRG has a 52 week high of .30. It is currently trading at .012. The reason for the big drop is dilution/debt that is now obsolete. $TNRG recently became a debt free company. SOURCE:  https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/TNRG/news/Thunder-Energies-Satisfies-All-PowerUp-Convertible-Notes?id=208919

TNRG has a current float of only 37 million. This is very very tiny for an otc stock. Small float stocks can explode with little buying pressure. It is an OTCQB working on a RM with a larger Nasdaq company. The new CEO of the company previously ran $MNGA and uplisted that company. He is looking to do the same with TNRG. SOURCE: https://youtu.be/10o6s5wlOx4 (listen closely to last minute). 

Looking at the daily chart, you can see clear accumulation. Look at the accumulation/distribution indicator. It is a line going almost straight up, indicating the float is getting locked. Today, a PR was released saying that thunder energies is expanding the development of magnehydrogen. Source: https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/thunder-energies-tnrg-expands-development-of-magnehydrogen-20181114-00543

I believe this stock has something big coming, and it is still relatively under the radar. With a float this small, I don‚Äôt think .10 is an unrealistic target. My shares (which make up 1.3% of the whole float) are locked up for this range which could come very fast, especially with the ceo of the company talking and putting out PRs.

14,PURA/KALY/NOUV - DD Update,9xbbvr,IknitSteel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9xbbvr/purakalynouv_dd_update/,1,2,"PURA has released Q3 financials, they saw 400% revenue growth and are quickly approaching 1,000,000 in revenue for the year, a major bench mark. The stock shot up 40% on this news from .08 to .13 cents. It's been as high as .25 in the past and I expect they will get back up or near there. 

KALY announced TODAY that they successfully acquired a patented extraction operation. This has run from .0007 to .004 currently, and as high as .009 in the past month. This acquisition could send them into the penny range.

Finally, the sleeping bear, NOUV, is expected to go current today. This is what I am most heavily invested in, as they are the back bone to this whole joint venture. Nothing has been released yet, but PURA announced yesterday that they were planning on issuing NOUV dividends, 1 for every 5 shares of PURA stock, and that is supposed to happen today. NOUV is currently at .0004, and I am hoping to hold onto my shares until they have expanded and are growing bud in 400+ green houses. But there should be short term gains here too.
