7,Penny Advice.,fsrr2n,JWTrader,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsrr2n/penny_advice/,2,40,"1.  No one should be holding penny stocks for more than 2 days.  These things are running 100+% everyday of the week, TAKE YOUR PROFITS and ONTO THE NEXT.

2.  If a stock has ran +300% in a day or two, it's probably a good idea to not get into them.  Those who bought the top of TOPS, WTRH, AYTU, etc, you should absolutely know better.  FOMO will get you killed.

3.  Set a stop loss.  Yes, it sucks to see a stock run up 100% after you took your 20-30%, but you can never lose money if you always close green!! THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER STOCK!!!

This market is amazing. 100% runners everyday, don't FOMO on ones that have already ran! 

Good luck guys!",2020-04-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsrr2n/penny_advice/
8,AMPE - AMPIO pharm. very interesting,fsqqxw,LoPriore,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsqqxw/ampe_ampio_pharm_very_interesting/,1,4,"A pharmaceutical company in Englewood is seeking emergency approval from the FDA to test an anti-inflammation drug on COVID-19 patients.

Ampio Pharmaceuticals has been testing its drug Ampion on knee patients. Now company founder David Bar-Or, M.D., wants to switch gears and immediately start testing ventilator patients affected by coronavirus.

‚ÄúCan we decrease the number of days the patient is on the ventilator and also, of course, looking at mortality to see if we can improve mortality,‚Äù Dr. Bar-Or said.

He says the anti-inflammation drug he‚Äôs been working on for 30 years should be just as effective on lungs as it is on knees. 

‚ÄúWhen I developed this drug, it was not intended for the knee. It was intended as a general anti-inflammatory,‚Äú Bar-Or said. 

If the FDA grants approval, Bar-Or said he‚Äôs ready to begin a clinical trial with 10 patients at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. Five patients would get the drug Ampion and five would be treated with standard care, meaning nothing more than a ventilator.

After five days, patients‚Äô oxygen levels would be compared to show if Ampion made a difference. If the drug showed promise, the clinical trial would quickly expand to 40 patients.

‚ÄúWe will see some effect within the first day,‚Äù Bar-Or predicted.

He said the drug does two things: it decreases inflammation in the lungs, and it reduces the viral load of the virus, making it less potent.

Bar-Or said the drug could be a game changer because up to 50% of all patients put on a ventilator still end up dying.

‚ÄúWhat kills patients is not the virus itself. It's the cytokine storm hyper-active immune response to the virus infection,"" he said.

If the drug can reduce inflammation, then excess fluid won‚Äôt build up in the lungs, which often leads to death, Bar-Or said. 

If the FDA grants approval, clinical trials could begin in a few weeks.",2020-04-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsqqxw/ampe_ampio_pharm_very_interesting/
9,"A Guide on what to look for in ""Pennystocks"" before they run",fsq1dm,Thatguyfromdeadpool,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsq1dm/a_guide_on_what_to_look_for_in_pennystocks_before/,11,91,"&amp;#x200B;

This guide will be short, sweet, and to the point.

First off you have to realize that ""PennyStocks"" or most stocks that are under a few dollars are mostly Pump n Dumps. You will once in awhile find one that is a legit investment on the long term side, but it's RARE.

**Now, What makes a PennyStock ""Magically"" Jump in Price ?**

* News (CT Data, Pandemics(Coronavirus being the newest one))
* A Catalyst (Upcoming clinical Trial Data, Upcoming Events)
* Pump Rooms (Rooms giving false hope of a stock going up, can cause it to go up, who knew, lol)
* Idiots (An example being people thinking the Stock ""ZOOM"" was ""ZM"", Jumped 60$ in a day)

With information I posted in the other thread, you're able to handle the first two bullet points with ease. Now you can either wait for news to come to you, or you can search the globe for what's going on and take advantage of it.

As an example, When COVID-19 hit the world, most of the experienced traders knew what to do. For the ones that play in Large caps like myself, We shorted Companies that would be hit the hardest like Air Travel, Cruises, Resorts, Etc. Now for people in Pennystocks, they knew to keep an eye on Cheap companies that were in the Biotech Field as well as Oil companies that would be affected. You'll notice that once news came out of a possible ""cure"" or ""treatment"" , the stocks jumped up a lot that day.

Keep an eye on what important people say around the world. When Trump talked about Ventilators and how bad we needed them in America, people started to look for pennystocks in that field. Same went for companies that produced masks(Even though 3M has the main contract) and other products that countries were saying they were in need of.

**Now, What if you're a Lazy fuck and only want to concentrate on the charts and not deal with deals ?**

Easy Solution... Watch Volume. This applies to all stocks and I'll show you what I mean.

[https://imgur.com/pDCIicA](https://imgur.com/pDCIicA)

This is a 1YR/1DY chart for ZN and the Blue bars indicate volume.  Notice how Volume is sparse to low, but then once it reaches 0.12, is when Volume starts to pick up.

[https://imgur.com/EiS72iR](https://imgur.com/EiS72iR)

Here's BYND on the same time frame and notice how volume is low and when it starts to pick up more than the average, it ended up ""running""

[https://imgur.com/MKUos3H](https://imgur.com/MKUos3H)

FCEL... As you can see, it can be a good sign to at least Keep an eye on it.

Now following Volume is not 100%, but it's a damn good indicator that something is going on if Volume is suddenly increasing higher and higher. Could be people are loading up for an event or expecting some form of news of coming out.

**Follow others blindly ?**

This Method I do not recommend (Even if some of the mods of this subreddit do it) . However! Keep a watch on what the most popular people on places like Stocktwits and Twitter are talking about. The reality of most of those ""Traders"" is that they are able to get a lot of followers to buy into a stock(either intentional or on accident) and have it start to pump.

Now don't be a sheep and follow , but be a wolf and take advantage of the sheep that do.

**PLEASE REMEMBER!**

Pennystocks are (mostly)meant to be played as Swings(Get in before the pump) or Day Trades. If you get into a Pennystock on a day it's running and you're green as fuck with gains, then PLEASE either scale out some or take profits. It can dump easily in the wee hours of the morning while you're sleeping if you hold overnight and that is not a good thing.

**Good luck to everyone and sorry for the shitty writing, running on no sleep.**",2020-04-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsq1dm/a_guide_on_what_to_look_for_in_pennystocks_before/

43,DD $KTOV,ft2nt8,benchieepenchie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ft2nt8/dd_ktov/,1,43,"Well, let me make it clear to you. I'm not an *expert* nor an *advisor*. I just want to share my DD at $KTOV, so you can give me your opinion about it.

First of all, $KTOV is a pharmaceutical company based in Israel without any long term debt. They do have a leverage ratio of 1.4, which is an average amount in the healthcare market \[1\]. The company only exists for about 4.5 years and started off with an IPO price of ¬± $3. Their stock price skyrocketed in 2016 when they announced a successful third phase result from their current drug \[2\].

Since then, they were developing a drug called 'Consensi^(TM)'. In 2018, the FDA approved this product for commercialization. I guess some political \~\~bullshit\~\~ stuff happened between then and now, but $KTOV announced that they are partnering with Coeptis Pharmaceutical. Coeptis Pharmaceutical is a *private* \~\~FUCK!\~\~ company and is engaged in acquisition, development, and commercialization of branded pharma products \[3\]. They both announced to start launching Consensi^(TM) in **May 2020** \[4\]!

You may wonder at this point, 'Yeah but what about the cash flow, dawg?'. $KTOV didn't make revenue from its IPO until 2017. The revenue started flowing in 2018, in which $KTOV accepted annual revenues of $1M from Coeptis Pharma in exchange for the commercialization of Consensi^(TM).

$KTOV is eligible to receive up to $99.5M in (commercial) milestones and royalties \[5\]. They will receive 20% of royalties and/or get a minimum of $4.5M for the following 3 years \[4\].

Sure, sounds good right? Well, there's more.

1. They also partnered for commercialization in China and South Korea \[6\]
2. Do you remember Consensi^(TM)? What the hell does this \~\~mouth\~\~\~product do?

a. Treat the pain from osteoarthritis

b. Treat the pain from hypertension

3. **Osteoarthritis** is the *most common* form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down over time \[7\].

4. **Hypertension** is also referred to as elevated high blood pressure. Approximately *1.13 billion* people have this serious medical condition \[8\].

5. Patients with these conditions could get treatment immediately since this is an oral medication; they could take them while in isolation (unless their arms are amputated).

$KTOV is determined to invest the money in the development of the new products 'CM-24' and 'NT-219'. Products that have to do with tumors and some witchcraft. I didn't do any research about those; I was already sold by the commercialization of Consensi^(TM).

What do you guys think? Did I miss out on something? I think this company has the potential to go $2+ in the long term. Stock may rise in the short term when the 2nd quarter 2020 earnings are announced.
