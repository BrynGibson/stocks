Get ready to short if you can get in. 

Background: Investview is a stock that trades on the OTC Markets. It is owned by Kuvera which is a Financial MLM. If a financial MLM is trying to promote and pump their own stock, you can do the deductive reasoning on how well they actually know anything about finance and stocks. Research more on your own and if you can get in, then it might end up being a good short.",2019-04-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/baa04b/short_investview_invu/

The outstanding sharecount is 193M shares

Float is 60M shares\*

\* (however they made the following statement on June 13, 2018:  ""The Company conservatively estimates that nearly two-thirds of the shares in the float are also held by insiders, employees, friends/family, and/or long-term stakeholders.  Therefore, the majority of the outstanding share count AND the public float is locked up by insider restrictions, restricted shares, or being held firmly by long-term shareholders.  The Company further estimates that the remaining **public float remains tight at approximately 13 million shares**. ""

In the past year, SSFT has done deals with the San Jose Sharks, Golden Gate Bridge foundation, Exterro, an unnamed Fortune 1000 tech company (for AI), a major transport system.

Here is the most recent news release discussing LOI to acquire 2 AI companies....

 **Sonasoft Corp (SSFT) Signs Letter of Intent (LOI) to Acquire Two Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies**Press Release | 04/03/2019

SAN JOSE, CA, April 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE – [Sonasoft](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UrmUa8x92dno_kOMssunWiThjAL8nH3pwVB9KAhjyTtovFSlub7Hd0sbJbpdweRaN27Ipc4zuAMe6tnGOx1Gxw==) Corp. ([OTCQB: SSFT](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w_dbwBJcXoUqXMr5PZbHPzVRlTV8QTKE6cXDAJ-Q68cMJP2tfz6LwSFUBwxjTPdZJiiwLUzEoVl582dEMmuFjeX1T9r8IjyRusMGq4ZABKw=)), a leader in innovative eDiscovery and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, announces that it has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to acquire E-Connect Software, Inc. and OPtimAIze, Inc., along with all related interests and assets.

E-Connect Software, Inc. is an artificial intelligence (AI) consulting firm that connects people, processes, and technology to deliver AI-based enterprise solutions to resolve specific challenges and build new capabilities. E-Connect Software, Inc. has a proven team of data scientists and AI engineers, that are located in Silicon Valley and India. E-Connect Software, Inc. is a profitable company with unaudited revenues for 2018 estimated to be over $2.5 million and net profits of over 12 percent.

OPtimAIze, Inc. is an innovative artificial intelligence (A.I.) company that specializes in artificial intelligence for information technology operations (AIOps). OPtimAIze, Inc. has its own IP and developed an AIOps platform that helps to automate service assurance, avoid outages, and accelerate digital transformation initiatives. OPtimAIze’s offering is aligned with Sonasoft’s products and services. Both target IT infrastructure and operations.

Should the tentative mergers progress, the following business value is expected:

* Sonasoft will be able to seamlessly integrate E-Connect Software and OPtimAIze’s AI and machine learning (ML) into all its products and solutions
* The combined Company will have the value and reach of having access to a large team of data scientists and AI engineers, which will solidify Sonasoft’s leadership in AI as well as add to bottom-line revenue in the lucrative AI consulting business
* The combined Company will be able to penetrate new verticals and further expand its market reach, particularly into the AIOps sector
* Shareholder value will be added by combining the intellectual property (IP) and enterprise accounts, leading to cross-sale opportunities in both software solutions and professional services

Both prospective acquisitions are led by the same senior management team. The two partners have held various C-level positions with several technology firms. 

“More important than adopting new technologies is learning and extending from the successes of others like E-Connect Software and OPtimAIze,” said Frank Velasquez, CEO of Sonasoft. “Together, we will greatly enhance Sonasoft’s existing artificial intelligence solutions. The addition of E-Connect Software and OPtimAIze round out our existing AI solutions. There is also no functional overlap with our pending acquisition of Hotify, Inc. E-Connect Software and OPtimAIze’s offerings complement Hotify’s technology. IDC predicted that AI systems will grow to $52.2 billion in 2021 with a 46 percent growth rate.  We intend to aggressively go after this market, and these acquisitions will help achieve this goal.”

“Getting acquired by Sonasoft will provide us with the resources, support, and network to allow us to grow to our full potential,” said Jay Sen, CIO of E-Connect Software and OPtimAIze. “Sonasoft has a seasoned and professional sales machine in the enterprise level tech space, existing IP, and technological expertise. We are very excited about the opportunity to join the team and grow the business.”

Further updates from Sonasoft Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries can be expected in the near future as the Company’s business initiatives continue to progress.
