Investopedia.com - Good place to get a handle on stock market jargon and popular terms used by traders.

Tradingview.com - A good web-based live charting platform and one I use when I'm on the go. It's cheap, I get live data and many technical indicators for $22/month. Has a pretty decent stock scanner. Also has a smartphone app. Ignore the idiots who post ""Trade Ideas"".

All of these websites will help you look at and research stocks. And yes as mentioned above in other comments, check out YouTube as there are several excellent traders that post tons of free educational material. Personally, from YouTube, I like:

Not independent sources; both are owned by Rupert Murdoch's empire.   Wall Street Journal is, too.  

Studying the financials, industry, and paying attention only to GAAP numbers is best.  Ignore conference calls that are just used to hype. 

If you're going to go to the pain of research, try to get independent sources.  From what I've seen, sources from Rupert's hellhole all hype and diss the same things at the same time not based on actual reality and the source of most attempted manipulation.  You have to think two steps ahead of the ""spin"" that the publications put on the stories they hype.  There's always an agenda.

Doesn't sound like a company you want to invest in, right?  


Well, things have been in the works recently.  There's a new CEO and management for the company, back taxes have been paid, leaving the company now in good standing.  

What's happening now, is a reverse merger.  What that is, is an alternative to an IPO for private company to go public.  It's quicker, and less expensive.  

So basically a private company looking to quickly go public merges with a shell company (LEAS).

The current known facts are...

* The reverse merger has been agreed on.  

* The company is an Asset Management Firm.  


The rest is rumors and hearsay.  There are rumors that it's a foreign company, maybe Chinese that wants to enter into the US exchange, and that they do at least 25m a year in revenue.  That revenue would give the stock a valuation of around four cents a share.  And of course there are rumors that the company is even larger. 

Right now we just have to wait and see, but there are good indications that there's at least short term money to be made here, if not long term.

But, and I'm not sure how much it truly helped me, I did spend two years double majoring in international business and finance before changing majors to something non business related, and then before dropping out completely from college.  And that was now a decade ago.  I do think a bit of that stuck with me somewhat though.  

For the most part though, about 9 months ago or so, I started reading this sub a lot.  Pretty much everything that was posted here.  Then I just expanded my research from there.  Not just about individual stocks, but about how things worked in general in this market.  Reading and researching this sub, twitter, ihub, yahoo, and DD on my own.  

If I found a stock that some people were saying was a pump and dump, and other people were saying was legitimate, I tried working in my own dd, coming to a conclusion, and then just watching that stock to see which it turned out to be, and if my conclusion was right or wrong.  Once I started recognizes the pump and dumps (and I certainly haven't always been right), I tried to figure out how I could at least make some money on them. 

If you only have a few minutes a night to do any reading, take your time before you invest.  Even if that means it takes you another year or two before your confident in investing.  That's especially true if you have to work two jobs to put food on the table.  Think of it this way, that just gives you more time to put away a little ""extra money"" each week, and the more you have to invest with once you're confident.   

Good luck :)       ",2019-03-01

For instance I went all the way back to 2007 and looked through any information on IHUB.. just to see what investors were doing in response to certain news.

        It's also the first time I've watched the level 2 consistantly and seen that someone can manipulate the price of a stock themselves. I'm sure it's common knowledge but when the ask was over .0001 away from the bid you would see a random 10k shares sell for incredibly cheap. Say bid was .0028 and ask was .0035 but share price sat at .0034. 10k shares would show up for .0029 and a random wall of .0029 bid would follow. It would drop the share price to 
0029  and you'd see the ask adjust accordingly and start filling. I've also seen a wall of 50m (when we were in the .0010's) get put in the bid to force buyers to up their bid. I also firmly believe that someone used the twitter news to buy in cheaper than the market. 

I don't know if the entire penny stock market does this but I hope atleast someone in this reddit will benefit from knowing. Watch your bids and asks with this stock people. You're leaving money on the table.

    What are the odds with the CEO being a merger specialist that he is leveraging the merger based on share price. 

Look how fast they responded to the negativity of the fake followers.

He's also hitting news right outside of trading hours. I believe this makes it harder to day trade since the ask jumps premarket.

He said they were fully funded when we were in the low .0012 or 3 (I think) when it dropped to .008 and no reverse split.

Are we maybe not accounting for the fact that some of our outstanding shares are about to become insider shares? I'm not nearly seasoned enough to know everything or anywhere to look about that but won't there be a hold sell period on the people receiving these shares? Also I'm wondering if current debt that we may see was based off .0003 pps and adjusts to the current.

 I'm here to learn. 

If anything other than the profits so far LEAS has taught me a ton. If anyone knows of any other company that leveraged shares in a reverse merger please let me know.
