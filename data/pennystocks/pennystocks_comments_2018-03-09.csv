3,zachdaddy84,dver4nz,/r/pennystocks/comments/832blj/why_i_played_penny_stocks/dver4nz/,1,"I'm assuming this was more of a tounge-in-cheek remark. 

But if it's not, I would have to equate this to walking into the cheesecake factory for the first time and asking the waiter/ress what they recommend or what's good here. 

My generic answer to this is what is your end game? What are you hoping to achieve? 

If your answer is to make a big number quick, I'd dial that back. A lot. 

Stocks are so turbulent that any sudden down or upswing can have detrimental effects to anything you own. For example, when the whole Dr. Dao incident with United Airlines happened, quite literally overnight the United/Continental Holdings group had a valuation loss of almost a billion dollars. Of course, the stock righted itself within a day or two, but those who had a stoploss built in, lost a good chunk of change because of that. 

Media postings, product recalls/launches, changes of leadership (both internally and board of directors), hell even the cost of fuel is only scratching at 1/10 of 1% of things you are looking for in a company. 

When it comes to money to invest, don't take money you can't afford to lose and put it on something that *might* have a possibility of doing some good. Save money so you can eventually put it into something that will work for you long run. 

Think of it as an investment in yourself. Expect to lose way more than you can gain. But from day one, don't expect to see a return. If it happens great, but, just like Vegas, don't expect to walk away a winner. 

I could give you some ideas, but I've gotten lucky on some of my investments. Airlines for example. 10 years ago I invested about 100 shares in DAL when it was roughly $8.50/share and right after the bankruptcy and the merger completed its final piece of the puzzle. It's currently sitting at or around $54/share. I was told, over and over again, never to invest in the airlines as the volatility of the transportation industry is too high to outweigh the risk of reward. 

Hindsight is a beautiful but useless thing. I had never heard of Amazon until the last few years. And now I'm (along with almost everyone) kicking myself because I didn't do any research. 

It has taken years of due diligence, market watching, and trend setting to figure out what needs to be done. Cryptocurrency is my current research mode. I always look for random IPOs to delve my free time in, just to see if anything is worthwhile for a long term investment. 

I know that doesn't exactly answer your question, but I can't honestly begin to tell you what's good for you and your money. ",2018-03-09

Penny stocks are the absolute wild wild west of the markets and if you are lucky, as mentioned already, you may break even.  But the cost of your trades should really be looked at as tuition in learning how to trade larger stocks once you are ready. 

Here were my big take-aways from my years spent in the pits of penny land:

-Never trade in or out from large candles.  The money is made in the waiting BEFORE the big run even starts. 

-95% of management is lying.  Catch them in their lies, find out what their motive is and research not only what they do, but more importantly where did they work before and what happened in prior companies.

-When the action is hot, never ever ever never ever use a market order.  

-Try to time your buys towards the end of the day.  Stay away from the first 15-45 minutes. 

-Big explosions in price occur when the pre-market is......DEAD.  This means there was news, people don't understand it, and by the time people have the ""ah ha!"" moment the market is already open.  

-Breaking through a pre-market high is a big deal, but only if it occurs on strength and volume. 

-The more times a stock taps a resistance line, the weaker it becomes.   

-If the Penny stock boards or major players are already hyping a stock on say Twitter, the trade is already dead.  You need to find your stocks before most anyone else does, this way your basis is super low and you can scale out. 

-If a stock is up 100%, sell 50% to cover your basis and let the rest ride

-Always always always leg in or leg out of a trade.  

-Obey your stops or plan on blowing up your account

-Understand the rules of risk / return.  Try to find set-ups with a minimum of 1:4

-Its not about the money you make, its about the money you keep.",2018-03-09
