1,atkafk,e52t3kz,/r/pennystocks/comments/9bex6b/lppi/e52t3kz/,1,"My personal thought by looking at the graph is that you should play it safe and invest later when it is in the 0.002-0.003 support zone. Just be careful since recent volumes have been higher than usual, which is pretty suspicious if you ask me. ",2018-08-30

But it looks like it's a hipster thing to do, so i can see it taking hold. Although mainstream is pretty fucking basic, and they don't like healthy shit, only shit that seems like it's healthy but tastes good.
