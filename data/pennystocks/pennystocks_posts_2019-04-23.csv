Thoughts?,bgliw1,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bgliw1/renn_imminent_for_a_merge_april_24th_thoughts/,0,1,"Hi there, please take this post as a grain of salt. I am a newbie trading and made my first 1k milestone hoping to go past 10k milestone. I look forward to understanding trades than hopes &amp; dreams or guessing games. In no way, shape or form am I promoting this or suggesting anyone to not or do buy the stock. However, but a personal interests perspective. 

RENN is believed to be holding a meeting tomorrow on April 24th in regards to an agreement of a merge, public announcement not private. From my experience, public vs private effects price impact differently among its shareholders &amp; buyer interests. 

The analysis shows the following:

- Low Float

- Underperformed

- Hold

- The market cap of 132.09 M

- Growing trend volume this past week above average

I’ve been following this stock since lower $.40’s, and it is likely going to be running continuously for next few days

The 1:5 reverse split occurred yesterday. Normally this would have resulted in a significant drop in shareholder confidence and dramatic sell-offs. However, this did not occur.

Pre-market held support at $3.70. As soon as the market opened, the buy orders kept overwhelming the unsure sellers, and the price jumped to a day’s high of $4.96. 

Afterwards, the stock’s price consolidated throughout the day in the upper mid $3’s. There was a brief moment where we saw $3.50, however that was swiftly picked up by patient eyes.

During **P**ower **H**our, prices shot up 18% and closed just shy of $4.25. 


Now this company didn’t have to meet compliance for a couple of months, and they still decided to enact a reverse split. In my opinion, they did this and were *prepared* for a drop in price. If it did drop, they would have released good news to drive the share back up.

There is more than reasonable possibility that $ARCI will be bought out by Geotraq. They have received offers for $30 - $35 Million Dollars, and are in serious negotiations moving forward. 

$ARCI’s market cap is ~$6 Million (as of right now it it shows up at $36 million on brokers that haven’t updated). If $ARCI were to be bought out, the share prices have a projected target of $15 on the low end and $20 on the high.",2019-04-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bgexvn/arci_exceedingly_promising/

This will give interested parties a look at the people and passion that drive VNUE, as well as some of the company's products and technology, explained in plain English. At the conclusion of the session, Zach will take a few questions, too.

Here is Zach's message to you:  


Dear VNUE, fans, investors, followers, musicians, and music lovers:  


Music is my life. Literally, every facet of what I do is about music. Since I was a little kid, driving my mother nuts on the piano, and even to this day, I still play and record music. Along the way, I have been very fortunate enough to combine two things I love very much - technology and music - and the goal in mind has always been to empower artists and to create new revenue streams in music. Three years ago I took the helm of VNUE and brought in the team and technology to \*really\* realize that dream to the fullest.  


Many of you no doubt follow VNUE's press releases, and our rather dry and mundane corporate filings with the SEC.

What many if not most of you do not know, however, is the story behind VNUE, and the passionate and small group of guys and gals behind this company. Most of us are musicians (some platinum-selling), and many of us have had successful companies valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We are normal people, not ""suits,"" who have come together because of our passion in this space. Normal, yet experienced and driven.  


Yet we are all here and grounded because, even though VNUE is small and under-valued (hint: great time to invest), we believe that VNUE has tremendous potential, and we are in it for the long haul. What drives us is the desire to change the ""status quo"" and move the needle forward in an industry (music) that is reluctant to change. We have the team, desire, technology, guts and fortitude to make that happen. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be leading this charge, and how proud I am to have this amazing team around me.  


This Facebook Live session will give me the opportunity to tell you about VNUE, our people, and our products, and how much we believe in what we are doing, with our [set.fm](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fset.fm%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0r_1RvbX7o-ObcTTMguCKgFvrnIUKTP9kPj5MEr3N3K7tFVIZX0_hTcfQ&amp;h=AT0PYrIXoMxHzDumrxM3yIRLTnGrReyDf7cMXDqbWNFkhed11kagIC1xh0KNARXQFyx5xoe-1OBa0Ui5PXfUa3Btqy20BESyiu0drVURV3zsTKrtL9bzpc046YJ4nn1JUQ0IZoYjL06UQkYrmbTZiVg) and [DiscLIve.net](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FDiscLIve.net%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3JS_ksF9RZV4YSvC9ceJDTINiUrHNUs-6iCn7a06l-6ERleR8kC03uzO0&amp;h=AT08X6kWh2-WmPQfsf-2wbGQVLTIO40OlMD1Bg6Ubt52fheS6B9vp2EwyuEA5QzXqSGDhDrm_EsDhdhAHMRqznOHyyfyrvCB0GYuSRWlFPhsxBMhQNwvvr42thiJMtOk3B9hW5LnRWWdJtBunWe8OoA) ""instant live"" recorded products, and importantly, our [Soundstr.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FSoundstr.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1Oc3NccJzg5FXhmNBMRFE-Taw6eOaqyq4ow6QylZdhIB6IpSgrMmYhtD0&amp;h=AT3ueb4DRjDje03NDPAQ4VUz6oNuC6WKBDyw1pj84dooEa27cofCQWrkjEEFlvb28rxMye8uvQsjZAOXMe4yzYZj89yXELXT1Z61QJuw58P2ddw0x6JwMBq5lFihJgkanV8VqM0rG_mitK0iUIc6m90) ""music recognition technology,"" and how we hope to reshape the music licensing world and to ensure each and every rights holder gets paid for their work.

On 04/02/2019 @ 6:06AM Mineral Mountain Mining &amp; Millin Co. (MMMM) filed this 8-K/A with the SEC    
 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66600/000147793219001377/mmmm\_8ka.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66600/000147793219001377/mmmm_8ka.htm)   
   
 This 8-K/A is an amendment to an 8-K filled by MMMM on 03/27/2019 @ 5:30PM which discloses they have entered into two Share Exchange Agreements with two separate companies.    
   
 ""On March 22, 2019, Mineral Mountain Mining &amp; Milling Company the “Company”) entered into two Share Exchange Agreements (collectively the “SEA’s”) with: (i) PR345, Inc., a newly organized Texas corporation (“PR345”); and (ii) NuAxess 2, Inc., a newly organized Delaware corporation (NuAxess”). Pursuant to the SEA’s, which were filed as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2 to the March 27, 2019 Form 8-K, the Company agreed to acquire all of the capital stock of PR345 and NuAxess in exchange of the issuance of shares of Series C and D Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share, to the shareholders of PR345 and NuAxess as discussed more fully below.""    
   
 Why is this pertinent to GXXM shareholders?    
   
 It is my belief, and I will show my research, that the company listed as PR345 is GEX Management Inc. (GXXM). From the 8-K, this is the description given of PR345:    
   
 “The Company has determined to enter into the PR345 SEA because of the reasonably based projected growth potential and new business opportunities afforded by PR345’s business plan which, in substance, provides that PR345, a designated minority-owned business enterprise consulting firm, shall: (i) provide specialized staffing services for a variety of professional industries including, but not limited to, medical, education, financial services, technology and hospitality, among others; (ii) provide specific back office services including accounting, payroll, and a full complement of Human Resource (HR) benefits; and (iii) either directly or indirectly through third-party relationships and strategic affiliations, acts as a Professional Employer Organization (PEO).”    
   
 This is the exact business of GXXM, even down to the detail that it is minority-owned!    
   
 THEY EVEN HAVE THE SAME EXACT ADDRESS!!!    
   
 ""This SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT (the ""Agreement"") is entered into as of March 22, 2019 by and among Mineral Mountain Mining &amp; Milling Company, an Idaho corporation (""MMMM"" or the ""Company""), with offices located at 13 Bow Circle, Suite 170, Hilton Head, South Carolina 29928, on the one hand, and PR345, Inc.

MARION, N.C., April 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE – Greene Concepts, Inc. (OTC: INKW) (greeneconcepts.com) (“Greene Concepts” or the “Company”), an emerging leader in the global scientifically formulated beverage industry, is excited to announce that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Nutrasource, a premier global contract research organization, to assist its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mammoth Ventures, Inc (“Mammoth Ventures”), with all regulatory, clinical, product development, and testing solutions for its ready-to-drink (“RTD”) beverage products and dietary supplements throughout North America.  


“This alliance is a central component of our compliance strategy and our commitment to all current regulatory and clinical guidelines for the launch of our new functional beverage line,” stated Karen Howard, CEO of Green Concepts. “Nutrasource has an impeccable reputation for excellence in science and regulation, not only in the U.S. and Canada, but globally. Having access to this elite level of expertise allows us to get both more aggressive and more creative, and to dramatically differentiate our products and drive value for our customers and shareholders.”

Management notes that Nutrasource will be in a strong position to assist with the Company’s development of its RTD nutritional beverage line, while also providing material value as the Company navigates critical opportunities related to market access, regulatory classification, and further operational and strategic development.

Nutrasource has four offices in three countries with a staff of over 150.  A provider of one-stop-shop services for healthcare product development and market entry services, Nutrasource specializes in global regulatory compliance, product claims support, clinical trials, and product testing for dietary supplements, cannabis and CBD products, foods and beverages, pet products, and medical products.

“We are delighted to have been chosen by Greene Concepts, Inc., and to now support them with their product development goals and launch plans as they expand across product lines and key markets,” stated William Rowe, Nutrasource President and CEO. “The beverage market continues to develop quickly in so many key areas through novel formulation, advanced delivery technology, and the resulting potential for unique strategies.”

According to MarketResearch.com, the single-serve RTD beverage space has grown into a $23 billion market, with energy drinks and shots, sports drinks, and nutrient-enhanced waters worth $15 billion alone.

Ms. Howard continued, “This agreement with Nutrasource will give us a distinct advantage in the scientifically formulated beverage space as we ramp toward our launch of core production and begin to strategize about new product expansion and low-hanging fruit on the marketing side.”",2019-04-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bgj093/inkw_greene_concepts_partners_with_leading_global/

The Agreement gives InnerScope the ability to significantly broaden its brand awareness by delivering personalized brand messaging through multiple Hearing Product commercials broadcasted in U.S. markets on networks that supports the 55+ older demographic for InnerScope's target market customers. In addition to the Hearing Product commercials, InnerScope will also have Digital Distribution opportunities using Premium Digital TV and video advertising to efficiently and accurately deliver messages to a wide range of potential customers online or watching content on a network website, through an app, or through On Demand programming, by targeting them based on geography and video content. The digital distribution will extend InnerScope's market reach and further strengthen its brand loyalty, which will lead to increased sales across all of its distribution/vendor sales channels as well as increasing the awareness of the health and cognitive consequences for the 40+ million Americans who are suffering from untreated hearing loss.

AsSeenOnTV.pro is an award-winning full-service production company and digital agency specializing in the creation and development of infomercials. Together with InnerScope, they will develop a series of Hearing Product commercials using creative persuasive visual demonstration with a compelling price and call-to-action offer to incentivize the consumer to act now. The call-to-action incentivizes the viewer to purchase immediately by calling in or ordering directly through a website or, as the case with the BRTV commercial spots, will be integrated with InnerScope's current e-Commerce sales channels and marketing strategies that will direct viewers to the next level in taking action.

Kevin Harrington, Co-Executive Producer of AsSeenOnTV.pro, commented, **""Having known and worked with the founders of InnerScope in the past, I know their passion and expertise in helping the tens of millions of people that have hearing related problems.  With 48 million people in the U.S. alone that have reported having hearing issues, InnerScope's Hearing Aids and Hearing Health Products have mass-market appeal.

As far as message boards go it looks 20-25 years old.  

It requires a paid membership for even the most basic functions, like sending a private message.  

All of the boards seem to be filled with people pumping, not people who want to discuss actual legitimate information.  

90% of my posts have been removed by admins for being ""off topic"" despite the fact I'm discussing either the stock specifically, or someone who has responded to the stock with bogus information.  And these posts are always in the right place.  


Seems to me like the entire site is scam, along with nearly everyone who posts on it.

PDUFA date for UTI drug on 4/30. Has received fast-track designation for the drug, and this drug has been approved in Europe. It looks promising. 

(There are never guarantees though). Also has another PDUFA date for another drug in August. 

I like the risk ratio on this one and like that there is a catalyst just one week away (next Tuesday). 

Can buy shares or even the $2.5 5/17 calls. 

Also we recently had a [golden cross (50-day passing 200 day)](https://imgur.com/a/8FKLIjJ). Not a huge proponent of ""crosses,"" but too often I've seen price action find support on the 50-day after a cross.
