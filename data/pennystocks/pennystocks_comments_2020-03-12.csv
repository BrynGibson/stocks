So what's the big deal? Well, here is the big deal. The test will provide result in 2-10 minutes. It's specially helpful at the hospital since USA doesn't have this rapid kit yet. It will also be useful at the airport as well to test travellers coming to the USA from foreign country. 

So far so good. But who is backing it? 
Well, remember Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech? Guess who their primary funder is? Well it's Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

These companies have already shown certain growth while the markets were sharply declining. Practically all of these companies have good potencial for growth without any connection with the virus. The latter only increases their possibility to go up. Many of these companies have already been discussed widely here and various DD was presented. Moreover these companies were discussed and assessed by many analysts in different sites like Tipranks, Benzigna, Zacks, Marketwhatch and many others. Among these companies are OPK, HTBX,COCP, HBIO, TNXP, IBIO and others. Their prices went down creating more possibilities to buy them dip and receive more profits. They went down only due to speculations, diverting the attention to new ones which had declared something connected with the virus.

505,newahns,fkcg2xl,/r/pennystocks/comments/fhafd0/ogen_news/fkcg2xl/,2,"This might be irrelevant to your question, but I would like to share what I've found spending some time on reviewing the P2 clinical trial study design, a poster presented at ESMO 2019, and a quick literature review.  

Link for the P2 clinical trial:  [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03234465?term=joslyn&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03234465?term=joslyn&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3) 

The poster can be found at  [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_136c39432f710016add4f8574bf3d4f6/oragenics/db/224/624/pdf/poster-aug2019v4.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_136c39432f710016add4f8574bf3d4f6/oragenics/db/224/624/pdf/poster-aug2019v4.pdf) 

It is a brief overview of ongoing double-blinded study on a limited number of patients (42 patients), but the main take away point is the incidence rate of stage 3/4 OM reported in the poster. (the % of patients developing severe oral mucositis during postoperative chemoratdiation therapy ). 

A paper cited in the yahoo article ( [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ogen-ag013-phase-2-trial-144500356.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ogen-ag013-phase-2-trial-144500356.html) ) reports 66% incidence rate in patients with post op radiation therapy **with or without** chemotherapy. 

Another paper I found ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313952/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313952/) ), reports 50% in post op radiation therapy **without** chemotherapy, and 77.8% in post op radiation therapy **with** chemotherapy.  The incidence rate in the combined group is around 63-64% which is consistent with the previous paper. 

The poster states ""52%"" incidence rate in the abstract, and ""47%"" in the actual results part. These numbers are the incidence rate of patients from both treatment and placebo groups. I am a little confused about the discrepancy between these two numbers, nonetheless, these numbers are significantly lower than previously reported incidence rates in the available literature.  The P2 clinical trial study's inclusion criteria include

1. **Planned to receive either primary or post-operative CRT** 
2. **Planned administration of cisplatin administered weekly or tri-weekly during RT**

I believe the actual number of incidence rate in the placebo group will be closer to 77.8% than 50 %.  I know it is a long shot, but I could infer that if we assume the actual incidence rate in the placebo group is 70% (conservatively), then the incidence rate in the treatment group should be around 24-34% in order to reach either 47% or 52% of the overall incidence rate. This will be around 60% reduction in the incidence rate ((70-29)/(70)) = \~58.5%. 

Although no one knows about the actual results, this could be a promising hint. Do I think AG013 will pass the phase 2 study? I have no idea. We are basically gambling here but instead of having a 50-50 shot, we have slightly better odds with available information.  You could go big here, but at the same time, it can backfire on you and leave you with nothing.  I guess I am willing to take some risk here. (I have 2550 @ 0.64)",2020-03-12
