New York, NY , March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OpenVision Labs, a New York-based digital communications and live-streaming solutions provider, recently launched its OpenVision Media Player platform with pay-per-view functionality to support an independent film making initiative headed by “Suicide Squad”, actor, Adam Beach; releasing “The Watchman’s Canoe”

In partnership with accomplished actor, Adam Beach, of “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit”, “Joe Dirt,” and “Windtalkers,” among many others, OpenVision Labs has released Mr. Beach’s first independent film on its proprietary, pay-per-view, OpenVision Media Player.

“We are very excited to have partnered with the innovative team at OpenVision Labs to leverage their new platform to distribute the first movie of this initiative,” said Adam Beach, “This is a huge step for independent and disenfranchised filmmakers.  This platform not only gives these film makers the ability to reach larger audiences, but, allows these cinematic artists the ability to take control of the distribution of their art.  That is very exciting to us; to be part of that paradigm shift.”

While the platform is in limited release right now, OpenVision Labs (a startup leveraging the Digital Arts Media Network, Inc. (OTC PINK:DATI) Public Accelerator-Incubator platform) will soon open up its media player to other independent film creators – with a view toward musicians, artists, and other content creators in the future. This will allow artists to get their content out and their voices heard by much larger audiences, and within their own control.  This means content creators can more effectively monetize their work and gain support for future projects; supported by their fan base.

LAS VEGAS, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--Adama Technologies Corp. (ADAC) announced today that they are on pace to set a new monthly sales record having already received over One Hundred Twenty Thousand dollars in the month of March in revenue from US Military Defense Contracts.   This revenue stems from a freshly completed order of links that are used in the landing gear components of the F16 and F15 fighter jets.  The company is anticipating another Ninety Thousand Dollars from the balance of this same contract later this month

Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, stated, ""These revenue figures are extremely exciting, but these numbers only represent one of our six government defense contracts currently in production and we have three additional commercial contracts in production as well.  As we continue to ship these orders, our revenues are going to continue to climb.”

Adama’s contracts are manufactured in Richmond, Utah in a 10,000 square foot facility complete with an inhouse engineering team.  Mr. Tanner continued, “We are very proud to carry the label, “Made in the USA”.  Alpine Industries has been in business for 50 years and we have been a company that values our customers and manufactures the very best parts for each contract and client we work with.  Adama is currently experiencing a season of unprecedented growth, but we have not lost our acclaimed attention-to-detail that allows us to make every job a success.”

The Company has continued to be focused on growing its current revenue streams within Alpine Industries, a government defense contractor, as well creating new revenue streams through the development of the Company’s new, online retail outlet, CRYX, and also utilizing the Company’s technology platforms to create additional verticals and revenue centers for the Company.
