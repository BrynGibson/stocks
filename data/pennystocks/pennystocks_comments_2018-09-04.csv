The gist of it is basically the marijuana industry is exploding and there is a need for an affordable, quick, consistent and reliable product for testing the quality of the marijuana. Today, the only products on the market are labour-intensive, bulky, time-consuming and 4-5x the cost of this companies product.

That said, the market exists (and quality test is required by Canadian law) and this company has a patent on the best product.

Fortunately too, this company is still very new and quite speculative. Their commercial production just began and sales won‚Äôt commence until October-November. Being as it‚Äôs still speculative (with a market cap around $60m, give or take), I think there‚Äôs a lot of room to grow - hopefully several hundred perfect over the next year. Management team is superb and have a clearly defined execution strategy beginning with west-coast Canadian sales domination and expanding country-wide, to the US and internationally in 2020.

All in all, I still see a lot of room to grow for this company because they fill a desperate market need.",2018-09-04

Xyosted is going to be huge, the only issue the FDA has with it are the same issues all TRT's have and it will end up being a labeling issue, so there shouldnt be any problem with getting it approved.    Next week TEVA's migraine drug using ATRS's injector goes for approval.    

The epi pen is going to hit retail by the end of the year.  If xyosted is approved, they already have 60 sales people hired to start marketing and selling by EOY.   


I'm not sure what all of these things will do to the stock price, but I think $5-$6/share by the end of the year is possible even without Xyosted.    I think a fairly conservative bet would be in the $10 range by EOY but I'm hoping for $15-$20. 

 Its flirting with the $3 range today, so that's good news for me.  Nothing is going to spike it in the next few days, so I'm holding off to see how low it will go before jumping in.     ",2018-09-04
