I only trade with real money three time a week and the rest with fake money (Paper trade). Started in Feb of this year with small budget so far I’m up 32%. Once I get to the $25K then I will have more freedom. 

Suggestion:
1.	Start with paper trade so you can get more confident and find a pattern that works for you. 
2.	Make sure you pick the right stock. Do your homework. 
3.	Create a check list to find stock before you enter. 
4.	Have discipline. Know when to enter and when to exit. (NO MATTER WHAT) 
5.	Once you used your 3 trade, DO NOT enter again in high velocity stock. You can lose money. Just wait or paper trade to keep practicing. 
6.	Keep your lose smaller than your gain. For me I only risk 5%. If it drop to that amount, I exit and try it different day. 
Some people will tell you to stay away from this. Me, I don’t care. This is money I don’t mind losing and is more fun than waiting for days. I see results in minutes and so far is working better than my long term account.
