That’s it. You’ll see many penny stocks like this. It’s all RS. This attitude you have towards people trying to help you will only hurt you, you clearly carry too much pride which is why you’ll end up being another casualty to the stock market. My advice to you is, don’t invest into these companies. They’re garbage and worthless. The prices swing day to day which can benefit you, or ruin you. You get in with a penny stock, and get out ASAP taking your earnings. Or you can invest into the company and check back in 3 months to see how much shit you’re in because they reverse split and got delisted after. ",2019-01-18

9,Derp2638,eec8cp8,/r/pennystocks/comments/ah6put/whats_going_on_with_this_stock_thats_a_penny/eec8cp8/,1,It’s easy to assume it’s a a reverse split when ever you see something like that. Which for HMNY it is. A reverse split occurs when a company needs to meet the listing requirements to stay on a exchange like the Nasdaq or any other exchange. Normally the requirement is share price over 1$.  Reason why it says 8000 is because when you split you essentially multiply share price and divide number of shares hence why it looks like shares were 8000,2019-01-18

They have a lot to do before uplisting. Maybe start by auditing a financial statement and putting together a BOD and Audit Committee not made up of insiders per rules. 

They'll also have to pay $2,500 for the application to uplist + $12k annually to stay there. They only had $28k in the bank last report and were losing money. So....

SEC filings can be found here: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

Otherwise you need to use Google to dig up the facts about officers and the PR they spew. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a fun fact: the PSIQ deal with eSwatini is impossible since eSwantini has yet to make Weed Legal there. Here's a facebook page that follows the topic: [https://www.facebook.com/pg/SwatiMaryJane/posts/](https://www.facebook.com/pg/SwatiMaryJane/posts/)

Swazi Observer newspaper would surely have an article if it were legal. So far I've only found articles confirming the illegal trade and wars between Dagga (swazi word for Cannabis) dealers. [https://www.google.com/search?ei=DEZFXJXgN4fZjgSljLqADQ&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fnew.observer.org.sz%2F+dagga](https://www.google.com/search?ei=DEZFXJXgN4fZjgSljLqADQ&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fnew.observer.org.sz%2F+dagga)

You'll notice Swazi farmers already produce (Popular Strain: Swazi Gold)  illegally and export it to Europe. I'm supposed to believe that eSwantini is going to let an American company be the only producer of Cannabis when its people already farm it? The argument here is by legalizing it, Dagga would boost the local economy. They wouldn't let that kind of money be shipped off to the U.S. Swazi Farmers would revolt.  

&amp;#x200B;

Financing: Stem Holdings (STMH) doesn't have $7.5 million (2.5+5 still equals 7.5 right?) to put into the venture as the PR suggested was needed to own 49% of the Joint Venture. Stem only had $761,351 in cash as of their last filing. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1697834/000149315219000622/0001493152-19-000622-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1697834/000149315219000622/0001493152-19-000622-index.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

They only raised another  $714,773 as of their latest Form D. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1697834/000089706919000015/xslFormDX01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1697834/000089706919000015/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) 

&amp;#x200B;

The numbers don't add up here.  That's not enough to cover the initial 2.5 million. They'll have to do another raise to get the $5 million if they get a 'license.'

&amp;#x200B;

You should watch the FYRE Festival Documentary on Netflix or Hulu. Billy McFarland is exactly like these penny stock scammers who spew BS in order to find new 'investors.' 

This is not Dan Oran's first rodeo. You should research NPHC &amp; BPOL. 

BPOL was suspended by the SEC and now is worthless on the grey sheets. [https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2018/34-83126.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2018/34-83126.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

It's so much easier to trade real companies. If you want to trade 'pennies' look at call/put options for stocks on NASDAQ &amp; NYSE. I traded AMD $20 call options on Friday from .28 to .65 and CRON $15 call options from .26 to .70 (still holding).  I guarantee you PSIQ won't make those kind of moves or provide the same liquidity. 

&amp;#x200B;
