ACB set itself up internationally, to be profiable we need US Legalization, but also needs to announce upcoming product, theyve had investors waiting with ""coming soon"" type of announcements for like 4 months now

Same with CGC, but has Constellation brand's investment, waiting on THC infused beer mainly, but they are pretty much on free cashflow and bottomed out. Theye had sneak peak on like 13 products out of 50.

CRON, they have warrants from altria that should be getting executed within the next few months. Cron has barely been spending money, MO and PM reMerge didnt go through, MO needs to find a way how to make money being that they lost money on JUUL and already heavily invested in CRON owning 45% stake. CRON is more likely be overtakin by MO because tobacco is dying out.
Other than that not much going on.

Cannabis 2.0 was launched Oct 17 for canada.

No one wants other giant companies abusing their tech. When that final and workable designed pair of AR glasses arrives, it could blow the iPhone numbers out of the water. Basically they are trying to fit the tech from a desktop computer in a lightweight version of glasses. The tech going into making this stuff is pretty interesting. They are dealing with complicated Nano size circuits . The tech companies working on a set of glasses are holding their R&amp;D tight to the cuff. All the big tech companies right now are desperately, I mean desperately trying to replace your cell phone with some sort of wearable glasses. The only reason the Holoens is not out by Microsoft is because they want glasses to be absolutely portable, amazing and comfortable. There are a ton of good videos of the Hololens on YouTube.com. Much like the first iPhone when you picked it up and played with it, it just felt right. Once they have that down pat, I almost bet that the next $ROKU or FAANG type of stock is going to be an AR company. Once the glasses look and feel comfortable and appear on the outside as a true technological marvel like the iPhone, people will dump there phones left and right. One day people will be able to add anything from their imagination into the real world. That’s gonna be pretty powerful for a lot of people. Probably even dead relatives in their own living rooms. Or just go on a walk together, even after they have passed. Advertising on the spectrum will be huge. You will be able to see people’s digital graffiti across cities. Many social media sites will launch around the tech. $ADSK was once very much like this company, now they are one of the leading AR stocks in the market. It’s a solid bet in my opinion. Here is a video version of what a day out of the house will look like in 20 years. You might want to turn your phone down, some of this gets annoying. It’s important to watch the whole video to see how malware and tech support is instant. Pretty trippy stuff. You can bet Facebook is up to their elbows in this.
