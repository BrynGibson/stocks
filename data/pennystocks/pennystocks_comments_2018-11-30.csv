If you can see your money burn right in front of you and still hold on hopping for it to go up then you will either lose it all or make a nice small profit.

I do think this stock could go up with this bill, but if the legalization of recreational marijuana couldn‚Äôt raise this stock by much this. Remember the other big name companies like $AXIM stocks went up 2000%. I do think that this stock might go up, but it already went up 30% and maybe it can have a few more of these. It‚Äôs still your money so do with it as you wish, just don‚Äôt expect miracle returns to happen. But hey I could easily be wrong.",2018-11-30

These are the main stocks that will likely have positive gains over the next week leading up to and most likely beyond the Farm Bill. This is not the usual buy the hype sell the news situation as the result of this will have a direct effect on these companies revenues and make it much easier to do business with American banks and lenders. It will transform some of these companies. I have been following a lot of these stocks leading up to this and have positions in several. If your looking at HEMP, that‚Äôs good, just remember their ATH Is about $2.00. However this is very different than any hype news this company has ever gotten, this is transformational news that has the power to bode very well for some of these companies. Bruce Perlowin is CEO, a very colorful guy, but he has positioned the company well to be ready for this. His pace of progression just seems to be a little slow. Their sharers are day traded heavily, as a lot of pennies are, time will tell if the bulls will reward this company for their long and patient wait. Other than HEMP...CVSI, CWBHF, HEMPQ, ELXFF, KGKG will probably be rewarded the most once the bill passes. FYI, these are not the only hemp plays out there, just what I am familiar with and the ones I know will have heavy trading. Disclosure, I‚Äôm in $HEMP at .0245 ",2018-11-30
