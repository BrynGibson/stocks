*Plus* they've got some 20 million in outstanding stock warrants, which could even *further* dilute if they get the price up enough for people to exercise them. 

So it seems to me that the price will go up a bit, then drop again once (if) the warrants are exercised. 

So what I think we need is some good news on the income front, rather than the capital front. Powerhouse has never taken off; there's a reason Dow discontinued the line. What evidence is there that it will sell? It seems like Real Goods is putting every egg they have into the Powerhouse basket. 

Every penny stock is a gamble, but this seems like pretty long odds. ",2018-11-10
