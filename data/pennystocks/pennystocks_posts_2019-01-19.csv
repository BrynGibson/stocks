I know there are tons of scam and Facebook pages that are not accurate. However, this FB page has been on fire since the beginning of the year. No joke the last 4 ones they put on watch have ran from 300 percent to 3,000 percent. I am not pumping this page I just want everyone to win against this market!

2,$300K worth of insider buying in v.FIRE this week,ahp77s,Sirrus_VG,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ahp77s/300k_worth_of_insider_buying_in_vfire_this_week/,1,5,"Figured it would be worthy of a discussion to speculate around the approximate $300K worth of shares purchased by 3 executives of FIRE all within 48 hours from each other earlier this week.

Here is the [link](https://www.canadianinsider.com/node/7?menu_tickersearch=FIRE+%7C+The+Supreme+Cannabis+Co) to the insider buying transactions at the open market. Obviously something is brewing to see that type of activity so close to each other by at least the two top dogs at Supreme Cannabis.

&amp;#x200B;

What we do know are the following upcoming catalysts:

1. HC inspection of additional 12 newly completed cultivation rooms (120,000sq.ft addition)
2. Official date of TSX uplisting (conditional approval was given early last week)
3. Q2 financials due Feb 28 (but that may change to Feb 14 if they uplist to TSX prior)
4. Completion and approval of remaining rooms by March 2019.

If there is material news known to insiders, what is the blackout period that they are not permitted to buy/sell within release of this material news?",2019-01-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ahp77s/300k_worth_of_insider_buying_in_vfire_this_week/
