3,$APRI Biostock creating ED cream - could be a runner,8arhj5,IamMat,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8arhj5/apri_biostock_creating_ed_cream_could_be_a_runner/,25,7,"They closed a $3.5 mill financing at .50 cents a few days ago and an Hedge Fund Sabby Management recently purchased about 1.6 million shares.  Stock fell from $3 to $1 because FDA didn't give approval because of a few discrepancies in their cream - they've essentially created a cream for Erectile dysfunction, rather than Viagra.  After they announced a financing round which dropped the stock to .38ish cents.  

A few reasons why I'm bullish here, could turn out quite lucrative.

Firstly management is scheduled to meet with the FDA April 12th to review and resolve the issues - they've claimed to be confident they can move forward.

Financing closed at 50 cents right before this meeting, the stock is currently at ,38 cents.  Folks bought into the 50 cent round rather than open market - this is a very solid sign.  Therefore, currently buying is under the financing round which closed.

Could be huge, currently no dilution and lower volume.  She could pick up fast.  Prior to the FDA issues this was $3, if resolved this could be higher than that - significantly.  We should get an official update April 13th - Roughly.
