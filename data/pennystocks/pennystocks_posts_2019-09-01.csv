I have traded for over 6 years, the trades presented are shorts exclusively. I hope this is value to you as expounded utilizing metaphors.

Around 3 years ago, my trades would look akin to this: https://imgur.com/BOfQa6I

My cerebration process was simple, short the resistance lines. At the time, it was only a scarcely upgraded strategy from my anterior one; shorting a breakdown. Prior to that, it was simply facsimileing trades from those I mentally conceived had more erudition than me. Turns out all these strategies were hopeless dead-ends. It wasn't because of my lack of ""hope"" or resoluteness, rather it was due to a lack of asking *why*. Why would a stock keep going above my resistance ingression? Why would people buy here? Why is the person posting this ticker that I traded?

Problem was, even when I had answers, the answers would be nothing but subjective interpretations of things I've already concluded. For example if I was going long: Why would a stock go up? My reason: Because it's a good buy. It's not going deep into *why* it would be a good buy, nor is it looking to *falsify* why. 

Imagine a scenario with a person you ken. It could be with a person you ken, or maybe a friend. Let's verbalize for instance, this scenario is what you'd perceive as ""negative."" Now if you ask *why* it was a negative scenario, your first instinct is to look out for evidence proving why it is. At this point, I suggest a simple transmutation in cerebrating. Look out for evidence *why* the negative scenario is erroneous, rather than right. This is the fundamentals on how to prosperously grow on a strategy and break out.

Circling back into stocks. Top-ticking is virtually entirely feel predicated. Designating after tens of thousands of hours of visually perceiving the same patterns perpetually, you ken what to expect on certain moves. While it's not an assurance, you ken the odds are in your favor. Imagine first learning to drive a car. You had to cogitate everything; the wheel, the mirror, where to turn, etc etc. Overtime this process seemed to become ""automatic,"" as if you already ken what to do. The trading style suggested is entirely predicated on pattern apperception of highly prosperous set-ups. What is shown in the caliber 2, especially on the offer, will give clues. While I cannot be forward with what I probe for, I will point to the caliber 2, and T&amp;S as revealing massive clues. SMB capital has good commencement videos for free going over this topic.

If you're still at the tyro stage, you likely fall for stock picks and a lack of autonomous decision making. To those who have an outside perspective, you'll descry the abecedarians drink the kool-avail of stock promoters, some you'll visually perceive post their tickers on this sub reddit. It puts the abecedarians odds of victoriously triumphing to a coin flip at best. If you optate to amend your trading, watch your own trades back on a screen recording relentlessly. 1 hour a day isn't enough, make it at least 5 hours of picking out patterns in the recording. Actively falsify hypothesis you engender about a kineticism. Overtime, this will propel you beyond the competition. The focus is not on the lines on the chart. It's about making a solid trade.

Here are 4 recent examples that I either top ticked or came proximate to stringently from utilizing the tape:

Watch the **screen-captured recordings** of all your trades individually several hours each. I acquired victory't go into an inordinate amount of detail what I probe for, but the chart is maybe 10% of it, the other 90% is hypothesis and a seeking of axiomatic patterns obnubilated inside the tape. Engender hypothesis on a stocks kineticism, actively falsify it, refine it, then work upon it; I hope it works out for you in the long-run. 

Happy trading! -

**When I use level 2, I find almost no reason to look at it when a stock is:**



**consolidating slowly, bid/ask war**
You simply want to ignore it when it is just a back and forth between the bid/ask and is getting no where. Based on what I have seen, some people put WAY too much time into level 2 when it isn't relevent at all. Why bother even looking at level 2 when it offers no help? Here is what it usually looks like:







**Too much volume at once**
This takes experience, you need to look at it and understand that the amount of shares being traded makes it super hard to get a read on where it is going. Rarely does it pay off for me to even bother to try and trade in these crowded areas anyway.



**When you're in a position and it DOES NOTHING BUT GRIND**
By grind I mean move very slowly one way or the other. If you are holding a position level 2 shouldn't be heavily relied on when a stock is slowly grinding. I would only consider watching it when the stock begins to take in larger then normal volume at a price point without budging. Even then, you have a risk/reward for a reason and shouldn't be so quick to take a position off. 



**What To Watch Out For**



You can mask orders. Simple. You can pretend to have a small order but in reality have a huge order. If you trade intraday you will see this multiple times if you watch level 2 closely. I will go into further detail on how you can take advantage of this later.



People will often flash a big order for a very short period of time to try and influence the price. Basically people see ""oh god there is a big order coming up, I guess I should cover here before it takes it and reverses quickly"". This is most commonly abused in pennystocks but occastionally you can find it happen it stocks over $20. I suggest just trading around it, not trying to take advantage of it.



Do not rely too heavily on a big order or many orders as a reason to buy or short. I see this often where people get into a position because the ""level 2 is in their favor"" but quickly have it reversed on them. I personally avoid using ""multiple orders"" as a reason for an entry. 



**What I do and the best way to trade with or around it**



When people mask orders, you can tell allllllllmost instantly. Most of the time it is a 1,000 share order or a 100 share order but that isn't the givaway. The easy way to tell what is the masked order is to see the time and sales and see how much volume that price is taking in. Here is an example (note: I literally couldn't find a good picture anywhere):

https://imgur.com/beBTos1

Lets say IBIO broke out to 1.40 and ripped to new highs. I keep a close eye for a entry short using level 2. I see that 1.50 is coming up so I keep a close eye on that price for a potential short. The stock finally reaches that price and the level 2 is showing an ask using EDGX showing an order of 1,000 shares at 1.5. This is the only order showing up at 1.50 at the time and sales are showing 10,000 worth of shares every second being bought on 1.50. EDGX isn't budging and neither is the price. People keep buying and buying but it doesn't  move. Now the question to you is, would you short?





Obviously it depends. It is too difficult to say based on no chart or anything to see visually. Just image a longterm technical breakout at 1.40 and it is having serious trouble breaking 1.50, do you short? I would when more people hit the ask to back up the EDGX masked seller. Once the stock begins to turn it will turn fast, so you need to be quick. I would get short risking on 1.50, covering into a quick washout. The reason why I wouldn't hold is because it is still holding trend and will likely re-test later with more stubborn shorts and squeeze through. Also there is no guarantee that the masked big seller will still be there. 



Keep in mind this is one example, most of the time you have to out think the people thinking what I thought above. See why this is so difficult? 



**Newbies can easily be taken advantage of**



I know this might sound obvious, but it is actually extremely common for a newbie to be taken advantage of during intraday trading. Here are a few ways you can take advantage of these newbie traders using level 2 (or just bad traders in general): 



Remember how I said above how it is bad to rely too heavily on big orders when executing a trade? Well guess what, what happens when the order disappears? The people who placed the order because of that one big bid/ask will want to cover. If you watched and noticed it disappeared, you can look to trade long/short (depending on where the order was made) just because the order is gone. People emotionally cover so you can expect to see a sudden drop or a sudden squeeze.
