\-     Leased area increases from 5,000 sq ft to 25,000 sq ft with ability to sublease   


\-     New lease has a 5-year term with purchase option built in

COCONUT CREEK, Fla., Sept. 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via  OTC PR WIRE -- Global Consortium, Inc., (OTCPINK: GCGX) has negotiated a revised lease with an option to purchase 25,000 square feet of the building the company currently leases in Sacramento. Global is currently trying to secure a First Right of Refusal on the remaining 39,000 sq ft of the building.

The new lease and purchase option will be between the building owner and Global Consortium, Inc.

Leasing a larger portion of the building gives the Company time to get multiple parts of the business operational prior to purchasing the building.

Global will use 5,000 sq feet for Indulge Oils and Infused Edibles manufacturing operations, as well as manufacturing for White Label deals. Another 5,000 sq feet will be used for Delivery and Distribution, which is expected to be operational before the end of 2019. 

The remaining 15,000 sq ft will be used to house cultivation and additional manufacturing opportunities.

Following the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, Indulge Oils will begin manufacturing its THC products for sale.",2019-09-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d1t5ej/gcgx_global_consortium_inc_negotiates_5year_lease/

Dallas, TX, Sept. 09, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- NaturalShrimp, Inc. (OTCQB: SHMP), the aquaculture Company that developed and patented the first commercially-operational RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture System) for shrimp, and its majority-owned, technology subsidiary, Natural Aquatic Systems, announced with Hydrenesis, Inc. today that they have delivered one of their water treatment systems to Bergen, Norway to test the system’s efficacy in reducing or eliminating the bacteria, viruses and diseases that have decimated both indoor and outdoor aquaculture to date.  


The international aquaculture industry is growing annually. The finfish industry is one of the most developed sectors in the industry and its fish farmers are known for being early adopters of new technologies that stimulate sector growth (such as smart-farming platforms, automated centralized feed systems, and new “clean” treatments for wastewater and culture water). The salmon industry, for example, is predominantly using sea cage culture, married with recirculation systems, for smolt and post-smolt production. 

Now, larger companies are growing fish to 500g+ before well-boat transfer to sea. The salmon and barramundi industries have been the major targets for Hydrenesis and Natural Aquatic Systems for this proof of concept work. This new testing environment, at one of the top aquaculture research institutes in the world, with over 1,000 employees, will allow us a testing platform to achieve a treatment solution for warmwater finfish and crustaceans, yellowtail kingfish, barramundi, and prawns.

Gerald Easterling, CEO of NaturalShrimp, commented, “We continue to expand our aquaculture capabilities after our initial focus of bringing shrimp to market, and with this development, we are poised to expand our capabilities to additional species as well.”

Peter Letizia, CEO of F&amp;T Water Solutions, added: “The Bergen project gives us a great opportunity to test and optimize our industry-leading Hydrogas® technology for control and removal of known pathogens in aquaculture wastewater.”

David Antelo, CEO of Hydrenesis, said: “We’re happy to provide technology that gives NaturalShrimp control over the oxidation processes that create so much havoc in the tanks. We believe that the key to profitability and success in the aquaculture business moving forward will be in eliminating the devastating effects of oxidation using anti-oxidant (reducing) technologies like ours.”",2019-09-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d1v195/shmp_naturalshrimp_inc_natural_aquatic_systems/
