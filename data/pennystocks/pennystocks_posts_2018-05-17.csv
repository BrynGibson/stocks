6,LVVV in the loading zone - best time to get in,8k56bq,IntrepidBlock,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8k56bq/lvvv_in_the_loading_zone_best_time_to_get_in/,1,7,"Yesterday a lot of stops got flushed. Judging by the action today it looks like there are very few interested in selling below .06. Also with the ratio of sells/buys today (sells outweighing buys by a lot) coupled with the fact that the sp has hardly moved indicates to me that this is bottom and MM’s are absorbing shares. If you missed this when I was posting about it before the last run, this may be the best chance to get in before it goes again. I had sold in the last run and was only picking up little blocks as it was coming down in the .07 range, but after observing this morning I will be getting back in for much more.

As always, good luck to everyone!",2018-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8k56bq/lvvv_in_the_loading_zone_best_time_to_get_in/

9,Red Violet (RDVT) is a “Big Data” company that expects exponential growth plus fixed costs equals big profits,8k6gqp,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8k6gqp/red_violet_rdvt_is_a_big_data_company_that/,0,3,"Beware it’s a highly speculative mico-cap spin-off but the interesting thing here is that when it was spun off by Fluent Inc the management team saw big opportunities and shifted from the larger Fluent to the smaller sized Red Violet.

This team have form having previously built up and sold TLO LLC and Seisant Inc 

Red Violet CFO said prior to the spin-off “what we are looking at in 2018 is growing revenue exponentially and because of the fixed cost model and how every dollar revenue comes in as contribution margins, we expect by the fourth quarter that you will start to see positive adjusted EBITDA and by the end of the year profitability within that business”

And that still looks well on track in Q1 earnings reported on Monday when
- Total revenue increased 112% to $3.3 million.
- Adjusted gross profit increased 665% to $1.3 million.
- Adjusted gross margin increased to 39% from 11%.

I sure would like to know in advance when this happens but that is not possible. How do you all keep track of your penny stocks in regards to a future bullish announcement? The day of the announcement will cause a nice spike, with a drop as usual right after, besides keeping one eye on the news about Jet everyday, how else can a person know that a news update is coming?
