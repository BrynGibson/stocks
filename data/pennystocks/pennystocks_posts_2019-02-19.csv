The Ontario government is really weird with how they control everything. Liquor is sold like a monopoly - beer store and LCBO. 

The items are taxed like crazy and overpriced. The beer store is privately owned, and the LCBO is government-owned. 

It would appear that cannabis is heading in the same direction. You will be able to buy cannabis from the LCBO, and they also offered 25 licenses in a lottery format for retail stores to sell cannabis. 

Choom has an agreement with one of the people that won one of the lottery spots to represent a retail outlet. 

This is huge news, because people in Ontario love their weed, and it's been an absolute shit show of disorganized mess trying to get it going. 

Aurora cannabis also owns part of Choom if that makes any difference to any of you. 

I've been an investor in them in for a while, because when it comes to cannabis I know it has to be marketed the right way. 

They do it the right way, and now they have a leg up on the competition thanks to a retail license.

Their shares trade for about $0.37 American.

PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 19, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Canna Broadcast Media/LoudMouth News (OTCPK: CBMJ) ([https://cannabroadcastmedia.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XM7d1RB1zeqRJ28jJrt_SvMXcgga0MKeItZ5uiE0-luNEMrzCZ1qFUZJt9QEIqv-lcowXpR4mEUerLBBrntILFKwUoug_RPE_Bs_BqX__Qmt2FZq6G6u3fBgNGWC_ZbQ)/) a premier cannabis broadcasting company announced that LoudMouth News, the first, longest running, and only syndicated terrestrial (over the air) radio program that focuses on the news relating to the marijuana industry in the USA and Canada, highlights Baristas Coffee Company (OTCPK: BCCI) , Aurora Cannabis (TSXV: ACB) or (OTCQB: ACBFF), and Pot Network Holdings Inc. (OTCPK: POTN) in Latest episode.   


The popular cannabis news radio program “Loudmouth News” [www.loudmouthnews.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nj8cvLdIGY2TxXGRyaB6DoT-01xQDwi1d34SjC6xC4ar7h_yeK44w-CGvLneH5xs9LaiAyHDa3atu4pKRQEoi5-0uUYthroGZZePQzX0Y=) originating in Seattle, aired nationally over the air, became the first, and is the longest running syndicated terrestrial radio news program in North America that focuses on the news relating to the marijuana industry in the USA, and can be also be heard via syndicated networks across Canada. LoudMouth News presents the news and commentary in an entertaining neutral manner, highlighting the most impactful current news in politics, products, sociological issues, businesses, and the ever-changing perceptions of marijuana usage. LoudMouth News is currently cleared to air on over 700 radio stations in the USA, 128 in Canada. In addition to being broadcast over the air, LoudMouth News is broadcast by YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVUtl\_HEsKdZ1uTlnjmgB1Q](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XM7d1RB1zeqRJ28jJrt_SpJHW3BsK08_Y4A-zbgvPaNXZESxQeo783lBgE9AV3LWu7vKE-9rRYNFMmMAVcZNobD_QuFhjKlmrvhC5Y6mlnShupAB7fC1uAKOlqq3JpySsNePuvvyJoCInphchljWG3tyZFrgGCR8wNEQqjq0fPmOwcsKiURiH42WnmHNCbQI) and is available as a podcast on all android and apple devices.  


The latest episode discusses how now CBD in “Full Spectrum Hemp Derivative” is now legal in all of the US and can be shipped Nationwide and beyond. Baristas recently made history advertising its Baristas EnrichaRoast CBD Coffee at the Super Bowl, The Grammys, and just advertised its products nationally on the NFL TV network and other mainstream media. CBMJ was responsible for booking all of the Cannabis derivative advertising. CBMJ is the only company that ReelTime Media (OTCPK: RLTR) will allow cannabis ads to be placed through on their networks or portals. The episode also discusses the impact of the recent acquisition by Aurora Cannabis of Whistler Medical and the recent surge in investments pouring into both companies. Also discussed is how some companies are leveraging essentially a rollup model like in the 90s with telecommunications conglomeration.   


In addition to owning radio flagship LoudMouth News, Canna Broadcast Media helps solve this problem for cannabis companies needing to advertise in certain mainstream media, while allowing its investors to take advantage of the emerging marijuana market without any of the risks that plague companies involved in federally illegal activities.  CBMJ has proven an ability to get advertisements for cannabis products and businesses on mainstream media.  CBMJ has established relationships in Radio, Print, TV, and online on a National and Canadian basis that allow it to get Marijuana products and companies access to mainstream media in ways that without CBMJ, are currently just not possible.

NFL Great Leonard Marshall has been an active voice and supporter for the lives of others, particularly children and other football players at all levels.

Leonard is the first of many influencers we expect to add to our Sports Advisory Board as we roll out our consumer branded CBD Canbiola products, Pure Leaf Oil.”

Leonard Marshall stated, “I am proud to partner with Canbiola and endorse their CBD products and solutions to the market. Their team has developed unique CBD products to address tissue healing and chronic pain that I, as an ex-NFL player use to improve my quality of life. I look forward to increasing the awareness of Canbiola’s products to the mass consumer market.”

Leonard Marshall’s storied NFL career is matched only by his post-football commitment to contribute positively to the lives of others, particularly children and other football players at all levels. In 2017, Leonard Marshall received a nomination to the NFL Hall of Fame. As a founder of multiple nonprofits and a volunteer for dozens more, Marshall has made philanthropy and advocacy his post-NFL career. As a C.T.E. survivor, one of Marshall’s passions is serving as a player advocate to ensure that former and current NFL players have access to hemp-based cannabidiol (CBD), a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory.

The company informed myself and many others that called them that they are going to acquire 100% of Rotmans Furniture as indicated per their 8-K filed with the SEC below and that Rotmans is generating over $35 Million in Revenues with a 48% to 52% Gross Profit Margin and a 19% Net Profit Margin:

&amp;#x200B;

Quote:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1308027/000138713118006316/vyst-10q\_093018.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1308027/000138713118006316/vyst-10q_093018.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Within this post, the primary objective is to show investors how I believe the Rotmans and their Board of Directors (BOD) are viewing things to justify why they believe VYST can get to trading on the NASDAQ without ever needing to do a reverse split. However, there are quite a few other topics that I will discuss that I have seen others post about that believe are important too.

&amp;#x200B;

The share buyback is important, but like I stated before, the acquisition of Rotmans is what’s most important because that is what’s going to bring ”immediate” value to their financials, the company, and their stock that will position VYST to meet NASDAQ qualifications to trade on the NASDAQ.

&amp;#x200B;

The 250 Million share buyback was announced a while back when the stock was trading at much cheaper prices. That amount was announced based on an initial budget that was approved to be used to execute the share buyback program. In my opinion, I think the company was expecting to buy back shares in the .01 to .015 range. With the stock trading higher, and trading much thinner, and since the price is probably going to be 5 to 10 times or so higher when the buyback starts, I would suspect that the company will be able to buyback 5 to 10 times less than the amount from that up to 250,000,000 shares that they stated. I think they were maybe suspecting that such price increases ”could” happen which is why they stated ”up to” the 250 Million shares as a best-case scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I believe that the company will be able to buyback anywhere from 25 million shares to 50 million shares. This means that with the Outstanding Shares (OS) roughly being around 500,000,000 shares per what they had PR-ed, I think it’s fair to use the Substitution Property to replace the variable of 250 Million shares for the OS from previous valuations I posted to be as a worst-case scenario, roughly 500 million shares to simply remain constant. If in the future a more finite number exists, then once again, use the Substitution Property to replace the OS variable.

Important to note, VYST has $31,319,398 available to be used as a 2 year carry back and 20 year carry forward Tax Net Operating Loss (NOL) to reduce the taxable income for the company’s future tax years. This is why VYST is such an attractable merger candidate. This is very important because this is what will help the company to trade at levels to meet the NASDAQ share price requirement of having a minimum $4.00 per share bid for 30 consecutive days. VYST will only need to maximize the Tax NOL by carrying it forward for one year since this current one-year time frame is the most important to graduate VYST to the NASDAQ. That means that the $31,319,398 will all be applied to the financials of VYST for the one-year time frame to have $31,319,398 applied to its coming year profitable Income Statement after completing the acquisition of Rotmans.

&amp;#x200B;

I explained the Tax NOL in much greater detail within the post below:

[https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=146107541](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=146107541)

&amp;#x200B;

$31,319,398 = Tax NOL One Year Carry Forward

&amp;#x200B;

Consider the VYST valuation below with using 500,000,000 shares for the Outstanding Shares (OS) derived from using the fundamental formulas below so that all may understand:

&amp;#x200B;

Revenues x Gross/Net Profit Margin = Gross/Net Income

Gross/Net Income + Tax NOL = Adjusted Gross/Net Income

Adjusted Gross/Net Income ÷ Outstanding Shares (OS) = Earnings Per Share (EPS)

EPS x Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio = VYST Share Price Valuation

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get to the share price valuation parts, I think it’s important for all to understand why I have decided to use the Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio to determine the valuations. From my conversation with the company, the company believes that the PE Ratio is higher than 20 for its growth rate. After doing further research, I believe they are correct. When analysts talk about the PE Ratio, they commonly refer to the trailing PE which is why such is what I will use for the purpose of deriving this valuation as such logic is further explained in the link below:

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-difference-between-forward-pe-and-trailing-pe.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-difference-between-forward-pe-and-trailing-pe.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

The PE Ratio is important because to get the Fundamental Valuation to consider for where VYST could exist to trade compared to the other stocks within its Industry, we must multiply the learned Earnings Per Share (EPS) by the PE Ratio for its Industry. The links below should help to better understand the PE Ratio logic as being the growth rate to help assess the fundamental valuation of a stock:

&amp;#x200B;

After the acquisition, it will be fair to consider that VYST will exist to trade within the Furniture Industry. Confirmed from the link below, the trailing PE Ratio for the Furniture Industry is 36.53:

&amp;#x200B;

To get where a stock should fundamentally trade, as I had indicated within the formulas above, you must multiply the EPS by the PE Ratio for the Industry for which the stock would trade. Consider below…

&amp;#x200B;

From these variables, we can derive the Fundamental Valuation as indicated below from two different models: Gross Profit Margin Model and the Net Profit Margin Model:

&amp;#x200B;

Gross Profit Margin Model

The company informed me that from the over $35 million in Revenues coming in from the Rotmans acquisition, they have a 48% to 52% Gross Profit Margin. I will use the 48% to remain conservative. Consider below to derive an Earnings Per Share (EPS):

&amp;#x200B;

$35,000,000 Revenues x .48 Gross Profit Margin = $16,800,000 Gross Income

&amp;#x200B;

$16,800,000 Gross Income + $31,319,398 Tax NOL = $48,119,398 Adjusted Gross Income

&amp;#x200B;

$48,119,398 Adjusted Gross Income ÷ 500,000,000 (OS) = .0962 EPS

&amp;#x200B;

.0962 EPS x 36.53 PE Ratio = $3.51 Per Share Gross Valuation",2019-02-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/asfqgq/vyst_updated_due_diligence_found_on_an_investor/
