With 30 mins left in the day, The stock price kept sinking .05 cets but quickly would bounce back to .07. This happened 3 times i think. 

If you look at the volume weighted Macd though, it EXPLODED in the green along with the value and an up curve in average. While the macd consistently bounced off 0 in the red until green with 1 min left.

Is this somebody sinking the stock but actually buying back large volumes to liad up just a couple days ahead of earning report?
