Its been half a year since I bought it hoping for them to put out results regularly but they’ve only put out one result so far. 

Looks like my savings are going to go up in smoke but I’m not going to sell because the guy in charge is the shadiest character who taught Steve Jobs how to be shady, namely Robert Friedland.

The stock has the potential to be one of the most explosive stocks with a fully diluted market cap between $50m and $100m CAD.

Could go up 50-100 times over the year as it has the potential to be as large as the Russian Mining Giant Norilsk Nickel’s original find or it could drop in half in the next two months.

Robert Friedland has basically offered upto $30m CAD to get 60% of the company’s share in the project + 25% of the company if they strike significant amounts of massive sulfides.
This is my ultimate YOLO bet.

Likewise, does this mean If i wanted to buy, that there would only be 10,000 shares available since thats how many the market is williing to sell?

SAN CLEMENTE, Calif., March 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Image Protect Inc. ([IMTL](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=imtl)) (imageprotect.com) (“Image Protect” or the “Company”), a global leader in the end-to-end copyright Infringement sector, is proud to issue the following Letter to Shareholders from the Company’s Chairman and CEO:  


Dear Valued Shareholder,

As we continue to gain traction with our new IPShare™ business model, the road ahead is becoming increasingly exciting, and I wanted to take this opportunity to update our loyal and committed shareholders on a number of very important dynamics taking shape for Image Protect.

First off, we would like to announce our new expanded shareholder communications initiative. Our IPShare™ transformation will drive a ramp in overall operational activity for the Company, and this implies a concomitant ramping of our transparency, visibility, and proactive communications. We are excited, and we are committed to making the rest of the world excited for the same reasons.

As such, we have engaged EHC Branding Agency (ehcbrandingagency.com) as a partner to assist in proactive media and messaging outreach that will include a broad array of digital and non-digital communications strategies.

As an example of our focus on communicating our story to the world, we would also like to point out our new video, which is a powerful tool for expressing what we believe is the massive value proposition of our IPShare™ model. (That video can be viewed at: [https://youtu.be/ABs8K2cohpU](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1F002xXIP65YIdyZ9F0drmZEHPrQdL6rRjlASjJIK0221gVA7cJ81dG5cjiUKq6KWJdbv3qRudOazqZ0ENCuH9PbSrNTsKi7OmWLhqxpVHg=)).

Next on the agenda today, I wanted to point out a very valuable new partnership that has been established: Higbee Associates, a very successful Copyright Infringement Law firm with a well-established reputation for expert processing of Copyright Infringement collections, will now handle all of our collection and litigation directly for all of our domestic clientele.

The Firm will interface directly with Image Protect backend software to manage the process seamlessly, reducing overhead and granting a greater share to all parties involved, including Image Protect.

Perhaps the most important value-add of this partnership is that it will take operations related to our outgoing model completely off our plate, allowing us to move forward with 100% focus on fully actualizing our new IPShare™ vision.

On that note, there are several major announcements to make today:

1. The IPShare™ platform will be ready for market within 60 days, and we already have a number of strong partners ready to immediately join and populate the platform and have reason to expect several major new signings very soon;  
 
2. We are in talks with a major Blue Chip company about a key partnership arrangement, and will disclose more details on this very soon;  
 
3. We are also in talks with a number of internet influencers and celebrity personalities to create mutually beneficial arrangements where our tech can protect their interests and we can expand our brand through their visibility;  
 
4. Our blockchain technology has been designed from the ground up to track infringements and images across the life cycle of the image and throughout the internet;  
 
5. We are also designing our own unique marketplace that will include more than 20 million images for free use, providing us with a massive archive of live assets for tracking and monetization using our IPShare™ technology.

Finally, we would like our shareholders to know that we have addressed any possible dilution issues with our previous shareholders through a very productive and open dialogue process.

Now that we have a growing sense of traction with a viable technology that has powerful growth potential in a major market, we feel strongly that all stakeholders recognize the shared alignment of interests to support the maximization of growth potential going forward.

The big-picture idea that is fueling our enthusiasm right now boils down to this: It is becoming more and more clear that everyone sees the need for a new Copyright Infringement solution. We believe we have that solution. We also sense that the market for that solution is exploding with deal potential as a result.

Stay tuned because there’s plenty of excitement ahead!

About IPShare
Image Protect finds millions of editorial websites using their client’s photos. As an option to the standard DMCA takedown notice, IPShare™ generates a block of code that allows photos to be copied and pasted into any website – similar to code references on sites that embed Youtube or Vimeo content. It’s as simple as copying and pasting the embed code into the user’s website template, i.e., WordPress, Blogger, SquareSpace, Wix, etc. The image is then instantly transformed into an online billboard, containing in-image advertising, hot links, social sharing and dynamic messaging. This is turning the traditional Copyright Infringement model into a cooperative relationship for both parties.

About Image Protect

Image Protect protects and monetizes creative works. By uniting technology with a team of copyright experts, we ensure that content providers preserve the value of their digital assets. Our web application monitors the global Internet to seek and collect evidence for illegally used visual content. Then our legal partners across North America, Europe, and Asia ensure our clients receive appropriate compensation for work used without valid license.
