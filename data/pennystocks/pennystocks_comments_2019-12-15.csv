https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/12/magnegas-mnga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

The jist of it is that they paid stock promoters to pump the stock with falsified documents/news about the company and then dumped their shares. Since it’s inception this company has diluted its shares by 1100% and haven’t accomplished anything in 9+ years. Absolutely no progress and millions of millions in losses. I see no reason to think that they’ve changed anything in the last 4 years, the insiders are still perpetuating a fraud. You can still play the pump and dumps if you do it right but DO NOT hold for longer than a couple of days or else you will become a bag holder.",2019-12-15
6,Jarges,fax2xd5,/r/pennystocks/comments/ears18/can_we_talk_about_trnx/fax2xd5/,6,"Ps, they were never at 30.00 a share. 

Since the company started they have done the equivalent of 90,000 to 1. 

Meaning if you would have purchased 90,000 stocks at the market price 20 years ago, you would have 1 total stock today. 

Their CEO is just the latest in the line of conmen they have hired. Unfortunately for them they are growing and gaining attention, so the SEC is catching on to their illegal bull s**t. They have 5 or 6 class actions law suits against them that have been filed in the past 2 years. They will likely lose 3 or 4 of them and more are likely to come, as the ceo was caught in a few more lies and overall manipulation over the past 4 months. He has also never purchased a single stock of the company despite pumping the hell out it. He regularly gets into arguments and make off the wall statements with 18 year old investors on conference calls and has admitted to watching the stock twits board on the stock. If you dont know what stock twits is, it's essentially twitter, for stocks, filled with people that would be the dumbes people on wall street bets sub reddit. 

Do not go long on this for any reason. You want to play it for a few minutes or hours. You might make some money.",2019-12-15

Good news gets announced? there's a spike in price, then you know the very next day they'll announce an offering and dilute their shares again. I wouldn't call this a scam like others might, I do see their attempts at rapidly expanding their assets and using these kinds of things to close their debt....but it is also scummy as fuck to bend their investors for this, despite them getting the turkey contract.

The good news is, they're predictable and great for shorts, the bad news is they are unlikely to really become a long hold company....if that ever changes in the future, I'd take their actually decent product and fuels distribution into consideration.
