2,swaggypnewton,e4jw52b,/r/pennystocks/comments/98zn7s/timothy_sykes_class/e4jw52b/,1,"His videos can help you learn important concepts about trading, but he’s not going to give you some step-by-step formula for trading stocks and getting rich. It’s just not that easy.

I have followed Tim Sykes for a long time and purchased several of his DVD courses. He’s definitely not a scam like some people say, but the only way to learn trading is to do it yourself and develop your own style. 

Sykes helped me learn the importance of trading around catalysts (i.e. news/earnings) and basic things like support/resistance, and measuring risk/reward. But I was still a terrible trader after his lessons. It took me 3-4 years of struggling before I found what works for me.

Learning to trade takes a lot of trial and error, so my advice would be to just start practicing with very small positions to minimize your risk. You’re going to lose money no matter what early on, but if you stick with it you will eventually find your own style (e.g. scalping, or day vs. swing trading, etc.) and then it starts to get fun. 

Good luck!",2018-08-21

I put a small amount in 1 account so I could learn as I went. There is just so much out there, it’s hard to know who is for real and who isn’t. Ricky Gutierrez is another name I see a lot on YouTube. 

Mayb I will try out one of these classes and see what it’s like. I’m eager to learn, just don’t want to  get duped. ",2018-08-21
4,swaggypnewton,e4jzo74,/r/pennystocks/comments/98zn7s/timothy_sykes_class/e4jzo74/,1,"Yeah there is a ton of stuff. At first it can be overwhelming, but the longer I’ve done it, the more I’ve learned to simplify. 

Most of the good traders I follow don’t really use a ton of fancy scanners or technical indicators or anything like that. 

Before you buy any courses I would focus on learning the following things in depth:

- support/resistance levels
- volume (super important)
- basic moving averages (I use the 20, 50, 100, and 200 period)
- VWAP (if you want to day trade)
- order types (limit, stop, market, etc.)
- position sizing
- how to establish a risk off level or mental stop (always BEFORE you enter a trade)

You can be a great trader with just those things, so I’d ignore all the rest of the stuff you see early on (Bollinger Bands, RSIs, MACD, etc.).

Start with YouTube videos for free.",2018-08-21

Steven Dux, Tim Grittani and also Roland Wolf (all people who learnt from Sykes) have some decent content for free on YouTube but you should buy their DVDs and learn for a real understanding. 

Also check out Warrior Trading. Ross uploads his trades daily and while his scalping style isn't how I like to trade, there is a lot of good free content there.

Also check out Will Karaman on YouTube as well. He is only 21 but regularly makes $20k trades a couple of times a month. A lot more raw teaching method but offers a different look at how to trade the market.

It's going to be mighty frustrating and you'll statistically blow up a couple of times but if you stick with it, you'll do very well for yourself! Good luck trading! ",2018-08-21

20,chuckangel,e4knsys,/r/pennystocks/comments/98zn7s/timothy_sykes_class/e4knsys/,1,"This is pretty much it for me. I bought How To Make Millions and it was a great introduction. I did Pennystocking Silver briefly, but didn't find it much more help than the free stuff he has on Youtube. 

Tim's system is very basic. There's no VWAP, etc. It's basically watch for movement, look for catalyst, establish resistance/support levels, create a plan, trade. Follow plan. If you're trading under the PDT, it sucks, but it can be done.

I've mentioned it before, I started with $500 last August, cashed out with $3500 in December (and dumped it all into crypto, lol). This is entirely due to How To Make Millions and Tim's free content on Youtube and daily, religious-like attention to the markets. Meaning I was getting up every morning at 5:30-6AM, reading/planning and I'd mostly stop around 8AM as the morning spike action/etc would be over. After which I'd keep an eye for news and then around 11AM I'd start paying closer attention for late afternoon trades (I made some decent money on $SRAX last year on an afternoon spike) until market close. 

Tim's everywhere for a reason: He pays a lot of money on marketing and also dumps money into some good platforms. I loved Profit.ly as it was a really good trade history/blogging platform so I could go back and read what I thought about certain trades: why did it look like a decent trade, what the catalysts were, etc. This post-gaming helped reinforce issues and also identify other issues (number one for me was not getting out of trades early enough as they went south.)

Things I like about Tim's Program: Compared to the other day trading systems? Super simple. There's a handful of patterns to learn and recognize. Basic stuff like support/resistance. Volume, float and catalysts. There's already a bunch of new shit you have to learn getting into it; don't overwhelm yourself as it's not necessary, especially at the beginning. For $300, I don't have any complaints about How To Make Millions and would recommend it to anyone looking to get into it. Watch it all the way through once to get an idea of what it's all about. Then watch it again with notebook and pen and take notes. Then watch it again over the first month or so as you trade as some things he covers will make sense after you've seen it first hand in the market.

Pennystocking Silver is probably best for the video library. He will post stuff ""exclusive"" to his subscribers the same day as the trades, so it's nice to see his recap on his trades that you may have seen happening in real time. But, honestly, his free youtube stuff is still extremely useful. 

He has other DVDs which seem to go a little more in-depth about certain topics, but I never got into those. 

Things I don't like: Tim's a marketer. You know why you see his name coming up? Because he makes ads. Tim has also dumped a lot of his own money into several things that I like, even if they are Sykes vehicles: Profit.ly is great for tracking your trading performance and also goes into blogging territory for recording stuff. However, I will never give Tim another penny of my money due to some shady shit he pulls on his subscribers in the name of marketing. That's his business, though, so YMMV. 

I got $300 worth of value from him for my purchase and I'm happy with that.
