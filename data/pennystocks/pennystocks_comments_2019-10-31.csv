Even when you are forced to view an ad while you're watching people's stories, you can skip them with a quick touch. Snap isn't on its way out but it's not necessarily growing either. For some reason they're focusing more on the gaming which is retarded because again, I've never met anyone that uses it. Maybe younger teens (I'm 25) but I highly doubt it.",2019-10-31

If Iâ€™m seeing this correct, itâ€™s putting revenues at 91B for General Motors. That might be correct, but [Apple did 265 Billion in revenue in *just* 2018](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue) , so like... somethings not right here.",2019-10-31

I like VUZI on the hardware side but NexTech looks like there is some great possibilities on the software front. I am convinced that the next FANG stock will be a company heavily into AR. They will make the glasses or contacts even so small in the near future, that it will not be seen as so cumbersome to wear. Plus Microsoftâ€™s new Hololens will be widely used in the coming years.

I've been in tech long enough to know companies often oversell what they can actually do.  What other information do you have about their product?

Looking at a Nextech job posting (I had to google separately, I don't see a Careers page on their site), it says this:

| Headquartered in Tampa, FL, with an office in Montvale, NJ, Nextech is a leading technology employer in the Tampa Bay area. Our growing team of software development gurus, sales and marketing rock stars, accounting and finance geniuses, support superstars and project management pros has more than doubled in the past few years. Do you have what it takes to join our winning team and contribute to our growth?

18,HoneyMooningBadger,f5ztz2j,/r/pennystocks/comments/dppbwu/opinions_on_investing_in_snap/f5ztz2j/,1,"Snap is a tricky one to me. In my opinion they have peaked and there is nothing more they can contribute in terms of valuable social media experience. That being said...who knows. I dont think it's going to disappear anytime soon but I feel like eventually they will be bought by some bigger fish and fade into obscurity like Myspace. 

Unless....they develop their instant messaging capabilities further. I'm a young person by any reasonable standard, I exchange snapchat usernames more than I exchange phone numbers. In fact a large portion of my messaging is via snapchat even over facebook messenger. 

I dont think you would lose much money in the foreseeable future but I also dont think their stock is gonna skyrocket or anything.  

I'm still just salty since I straddled SNAP over their last earning calls and lost big time.",2019-10-31
