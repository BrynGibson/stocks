55,chuckangel,e99eg08,/r/pennystocks/comments/9v34j7/whats_with_tim_sykes_and_are_his_programs_worth/e99eg08/,1,"I usually post the same thing when Tim comes up: he's a very basic, very conservative trader who waits for ideal setups and minimizes his risks. The ""downside"" is that it's not very aggressive; you're not trading every single day. The upside: you probably don't need to and are over-trading if you find yourself doing that. Granted, he teaches doing this, but until you know what a perfect set-up is and how to correctly assess risk, etc, you're kinda out there like wtf am I doing. ;) 

I bought How To Make Millions. It gave me a very good overview of what I'm supposed to be doing and I don't regret that $300 (I've made way more than that). I was a member of his newsletter/chatroom for a brief while but I didn't get a lot of value from either, although I did FOMO a trade and made a hundred bucks based on chatroom chatter. Total luck. 

Recently, I found a used copy of Tim Grittani's ""Trading Tickers"" and frankly, it fucking answers a ton of the questions I still had after How To Make Millions (HTMM). One of his chapters is on watching Level 2 and it's more in-depth than Sykes' portion on HTMM. While I haven't gotten through the whole thing, so far I'm liking it quite a bit. Sykes likes to pontificate and hold court and sometimes it takes him an hour to get to a point that could've been made in about 30 seconds, much like my posts. Grittani seems to get to the meat of things a little quicker.

There's a book, ""The Complete Pennystocking course"" by one of Sykes' students and co-founders of the StocksToTrade program. If you ignore the constant plugs for StocksToTrade (fucking $179/month, who the fuck can afford that when starting out and you don't even know what you're looking at? Just get ThinkOrSwim; it's free), there seems to be a solid little plan in there on how to learn this shit and it's like $30 on amazon. I'm only through a couple chapters and it also covers a lot of the same ground and gives you some exercises to work with. it stresses the importance of things like keeping a trading journal and why you want to keep it as well as what to actually record in the journal. I'm just getting to a portion with spreadsheets and it's really nice to see how other traders track their profits/losses. I was using profit.ly when I traded, but I'd rather keep my trades to myself now. I'm not trying to impress anyone but myself, honestly (it is nice to brag every now and then, but fuck it, I'm not trying to be a guru or anything; I just want to be a successful pennystock day trader and live my life). 

So, yeah, I'm okay with Tim's actual educational material. ",2018-11-07
56,chuckangel,e99fayg,/r/pennystocks/comments/9v34j7/whats_with_tim_sykes_and_are_his_programs_worth/e99fayg/,1,"I give him props for a few things:
1) he records all his trades. Losses and all. In near real time.
2) Every year, he resets his teaching account back to $12k, I think. And then he builds that account over the course of the year and shows how, once you've got this thing nailed, how he can turn $12k into about $100-200k, every single year in any market. It's a fucking grind. And because of #1, you know it's legit. 
3) He continually stresses that you should never, ever follow his trades. He posts his trades so YOU can go look at the setup and, hopefully, figure out *why* he liked that setup and *why* he made that trade. Sometimes he still fucks up. Or he's too early. Or too late. Or whatever. That's invaluable to me, and one of the things I do tend to respect about a teacher is the ability to show mistakes. 
4) Focus on studying. This isn't going to make you rich overnight. It's basically a part-time if not full-time job when you first start out and it might take a few *years* to become consistently profitable. That's a lot of grinding and a lot of learning. You can burn yourself out, btw, so be careful. 
5) Tim constantly harps on becoming an independent trainer. The perfect student is the one who masters his material, learns to trade on her own and doesn't need a chatroom, an alerts newsletter, or whatever and makes her own trades and money. I dunno if that's just empty platitudes because he makes a ton of money off of that shit, but it's good to hear, at least.
