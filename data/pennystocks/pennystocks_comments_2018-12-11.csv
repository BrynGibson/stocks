Penny stocks are incredibly volatile and it is much easier to take losses than make profit. Also a lot depends on investing strategy, are you a day trader, a swing trader, someone investing in small biotechs waiting on FDA results? If you have less than 20k in your account day trading is pretty much out (you get three day trades every five days).",2018-12-11

They are developing a new drug that is just about to start its last Phase 2 trial on 200 + Osteoarthritis patients.  The good news about this stock is that when Phase 2 Part A was successful the stock popped from about .20/share to .80 on the good news.  At the moment there are stock warrants about to expire on Dec 15th priced at 0.22/share which may or may not be exercised.  Whats good about this company? A lot!  They are fully funded for their next trial which is about to begin in January.  Top line results readout in Q2 2019.  Fully diluted Share Count of 260M and the advisory board they just brought on board have all done $1B pharma deals.    There has been lots of chat on ATE.V on this board a year ago, but went quiet after the last trial results.  However, expect momentum to build once the trial starts in January.  At the moment the stock is at a discount given known results and the fact that its only known warrants holding the stock down near 0.22/share, these expire on Dec 15.  Best part, since the company is funded to results day you need not worry about them not being able to fund.  Further, forecast on successful results is $1.80/share CAD (Zacks), $1.40 USD (Morningstar).  Phase I looked at 25 patients and the WOMAC scores were superior.  Soo since we already passed the harder Phase 2 tests its simply a larger repeat of Phase I but with 250 patients and double blinded.  If your looking to day trade, I'd say don't buy this one, but if your looking for a PAY DAY.  I'd park some cash here and wait till April / May for the news. GL",2018-12-11

11,im_not_eric,eblfg88,/r/pennystocks/comments/a56pxa/new_to_the_game/eblfg88/,1,"It's the law. You need 20k in your account to day trade regularly otherwise you can only do 3 day trades over the term of 5 trading days.

A day trade is defined as buying then selling shares within the same day. A trading day is any day the market is open, so it isn't necessarily within a given week (like how last Wednesday the market closed for  HW Bush's funeral) but can spill over into the next.

If you do the fourth trade over that time period, your account is locked for 90 days. Many brokers have protection for this.

One loophole is that you can buy the night before and sell the following morning after the bell rings so you could still turn fast profits over a 24 hour period, you'll just need more planning.

I believe this is done to prevent massive price fluctuations caused by inexperienced people. ",2018-12-11
