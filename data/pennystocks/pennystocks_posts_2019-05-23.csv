&amp;#x200B;

I followed them several years ago after tuning in to their nano technology portable battery pack, but not much was happening with their last CEO. At the end of last year the company was taken over by Anshu Bhatnagar, the same person who has made major positive changes for VRUS. The XDSLD ticker is new after just finalizing a reverse split (formerly XDSL). Does anyone have any info on this company? I have a small position, considering further investment, and I am cautiously optimistic, in part because Anshu has proven himself a competent CEO, but also because they have some very competitive nano tech patents that may be utilized in the portable battery / electric vehicle industry.

Clearly it is, and the guys that keep posting about it are trying to bring in new investors so we can all make money and help one another out, idk about you, but I'm a broke bitch and want to see others make bank with me, Instead of hiding in the dark promoting bullshit while I'm low key buying into stocks I've never talked about. There is plenty of evidence that supports everything they are doing, and not a shed of evidence that doesn't, the only thing you guys are worried about is the PPS, which has nothing to do with what the company is doing, people short, people flip, it fucks with the PPS it happens a lot with good and bad stocks and if you don't think so, then they aren't in the otc, and oh BTW, bemg won't be an otc stock much longer as it's uplisting to otcqb where flipping and other Bs isn't so apparent. Buy, sell, hold i don't care anymore, for those who don't know what to do, 100% buy. Do you DD there is plenty of it and it's very easy to find.

“While this is not an equity crowdfunding offering, nor a campaign directly launched or supported by TruCrowd, Inc., it is still exciting to see one of our industry-specific portals leveraged for a Reg A+ offering,” stated Vincent Petrescu, President of TruCrowd, Inc.  “Especially when this offering is [reported by OrgHarvest](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5oXRkiJvgxH9NRvnUfH1mx7DHIe2dbN905e_6e7F4_4LuuhAzm4I4zF0q0pUSUXMEsMrqfydPjSM4jqqKjhG4R9kjXEwNHDh5liSb_keo2ahaczgOv_5Safo92lG2NRpvH0JeZ2VKY36SmLEby7Mu4CFqf-DYkf258cN16Q8AMmbFhWLV4jjGKeqd8AAexqYe7z8_26EfRIEMPcrNnto1oPYllAMpwBPKnyYfIp8QE6ZPED-ZoVxiIRj_cZPkJOL9DI80TuDN9qVj2nSwIpAbvZcCC0bzGWp8MtYAXyds5s=) to be, the first such offering made by a cannabis cultivation company.”

Mr. Petrescu concluded, “As the first and currently only cannabis-focused equity crowdfunding portal operating, opportunities like this continue to increase the overall visibility of Fundanna.com. While I may not know what the future of Reg A+ holds for TruCrowd, with new listings continually onboarded for Reg.

## Deal Provides SinglePoint Monthly Access to over $50 Million in available products to Streamline Sales Process to CBD Positioned Companies

PHOENIX, May 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **via OTC PR WIRE** \-- SinglePoint (OTCQB: SING) announced today that it has signed a comprehensive supply chain and co-selling agreement with Nevada based JMSJ Holdings.  The scope of the agreement provides SinglePoint, guaranteed access to $50 Million USD of industrial hemp derived CBD isolate each month.  SinglePoint will then in turn offer for sale CBD Distillate, CBD Isolate, and Hemp Biomass to fortune 500 and B2B companies to be used in the manufacturing of retail products.  


According to President Wil Ralston, ""There’s a lot of confusion among the CBD marketplace, specifically companies that are actively endeavoring to purchase Hemp and CBD raw materials necessary to formulate/fabricate retail products.  We dove into this intricacy and quickly saw an opportunity for SinglePoint to step in and streamline the exchange between buyers and sellers.  Our agreement with JMSJ Holdings gives us access to a consistent supply of products and a direct co-selling relationship.  We are confident that customers will respond favorably and SinglePoint's revenues attributed to the CBD market segment will grow exponentially as a result.""

Meghan Rodriguez, co-founder of JMSJ Holdings, ""We are excited to partner with SinglePoint on this bold initiative.  Our experience to date has been that in which the demand consistently outgrows the supply. Yet, the continued demand for hemp derivatives remains prevalent, in accordance with third-party analyst supporting expectations of consistent market growth well into 2030.  In large, our success in the hemp market has been a byproduct of the longitudinal approach taken to construct a robust supply chain rooted in operational 'know-how'.  However, frequently the rate at which additional market share can be acquired is directly impacted by Buyer misinformation.  Resulting in the necessity to ask the Buyer to participate in a time-intensive process focused on qualifying prospective clients.  SinglePoint, being a fully reporting public company brings a certain transparency to much of the aforementioned vetting process.  Our expectation is that in tandem with SinglePoint, buyers will become aware of our premium offering; now able to purchase goods in a condensed time frame at a meaningful internal cost reduction.  Earned efficiencies in combination with SinglePoint's willingness to co-invest authoring a truly ‘consistent supply’ are likely to result in significant revenue.""

SinglePoint has set up a new sales hotline to facilitate inquiries and sales. Interested parties can call 855-203-3318 or send email to [sales@singlepoint.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2tBGS8R8HOmiNie2PzzWtJ4lZ0K_9xbXRuFKMuKHdT7D4yPRLAstn3yyBu5iA9dWOG9A9Nu1zkLunNYOFcUInCBLu40gIwH-iO9WMD36LJA=)",2019-05-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bs4uaf/sing_singlepoint_signs_master_distribution_and/
