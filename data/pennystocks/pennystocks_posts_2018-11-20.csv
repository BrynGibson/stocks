EUGENE, Ore., Nov. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quest Solution, Inc. (QUES) (“Quest” or “the Company”), a provider of Supply Chain and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, announced its financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018.

Shai Lustgarten, CEO, commented, “We are pleased to have delivered a solid third quarter, reflected in 3.6% organic growth, increased adjusted EBITDA and a strong order backlog that we believe will drive continued momentum through the end of 2018 and into 2019.  In an exciting development after the close of the quarter, we announced the acquisition of HTS Image Processing, which adds patented AI technology to our portfolio of solutions, positioning us to take advantage of new opportunities in the marketplace.   In addition to sales growth in the third quarter, we continued to execute our turnaround plan and reduced our total operating expense by $0.3M or 10% as compared with the third quarter of 2017.  This included a reduction of approximately $0.7M or 29% in salary and benefits.  We remain focused on servicing our Fortune 500 customers with our industry-tailored, end-to-end solutions that intelligently connect people, assets and data to help our customers make business-critical decisions.

“Our acquisition of HTS Image Processing significantly expands our capabilities to include AI technology solutions for use by our current blue chip customers as well as by new customers from growing verticals like Security, Safe City, Traffic Management, Parking automation, Surveillance and Access Control.  The acquired AI technology is capable of machine recognition and data recording of invaluable information for managerial and marketing decision making. As the AI solutions are mainly based on sophisticated software, our new mix of products and solutions should increase our margins and generate profitability.  HTS brings several existing Homeland Security anti-terror projects and discerning customers and users including: the Brookhaven National Laboratory (for access control), JFK Airport, Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, Boston’s Logan Airport, the U.S. Department of Transportation for readers at the US/Mexico border crossing, as well as a Middle Eastern Homeland Security authority for the automated monitoring of sensitive zones.”

Mr. Lustgarten concluded: “To date in 2018 we have made excellent progress, highlighted by debt reduction, significant expense reduction and the acquisition of industry leading AI technology.  With these developments we have transformed Quest and we look forward to an exciting 2019, as we continue to drive innovation, efficiency and profitability.”

**Financial Results:**

Quest reported revenues of $13.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $13.0 million in the comparable 2017 period.  The increase was primarily related to strong execution by the Company’s sales team and growing customer relationships.  Gross margin decreased to 20.1% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 21.8% in the prior year period.  Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 decreased 8.9% to $3.1 million, or 22.9% of revenue, compared to $3.4 million, or 26.1% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily related to a $0.7M reduction in salary and employee benefits expenses. 

Net loss attributable to common stockholders of $0.98 million, or a loss of $0.02 per share, was consistent with the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) for the third quarter of 2018 was $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million in the prior year.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Quest reported revenues of $42.4 million as compared to $40.9 million in the prior year period.  The increase was primarily related to strong execution by the Company’s sales team and growing customer relationships. Gross margin decreased to 20.5% as compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Total operating expenses for the first nine months of 2018 increased 16.4% to $10.6 million, or 25.1% of revenue, compared to $9.1 million, or 22.3% of revenue, in the comparable 2017 period. The increase was primarily related to non-cash changes related to issuances under the Company’s new Equity Incentive Plan, increases in sales commissions related to revenue growth, and increased professional fees.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $4.5 million, or a loss of $0.11 per share on a nine-month basis, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or a loss of $0.05 per share, in the comparable 2017 period.  The increase in net loss was primarily related to non-cash changes related to issuances under the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan, increased professional fees, and the conversion of a debt instrument into common stock requiring the Company to recognize a non-cash loss on debt settlement in the amount of $1.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2018 was $1.46 million compared to $1.4 million in the prior year.
