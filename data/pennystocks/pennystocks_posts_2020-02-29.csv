The Coronavirus outbreak has reached the ‚Äú[highest level](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51680560)‚Äù of risk for the world, the World Health Organization announced today.

*[Keep in mind the asymptomatic period was reported to be at most 27 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/), which means public exposure in these countries could have began weeks ago.

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly harder.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3¬∑5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1¬∑5. For R0 values of 2¬∑5 or 3¬∑5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6.

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.",2020-02-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fb63j4/corona_virus_research_and_stock_dd_part_2/

* 43 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship

* 3 people repatriated from China

* 15 US cases

[The 15 US cases include nine in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California. The latest case in California did not have any relevant travel history or known contact with another infected person, suggesting it could be the first instance of ""community spread"" of the virus in the United States, according to health officials.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html)

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.",2020-02-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fb5skw/corona_virus_research_and_stock_dd_part_2/

18,An Honest Look/In Depth DD/Opinion on IBIO,fbcqy4,hchiyan0925,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbcqy4/an_honest_lookin_depth_ddopinion_on_ibio/,1,46,"Relatively new investor here, especially in penny stocks, switched over this week due to the complete disaster that is the US markets right now. Disclaimer: After clearing $500 in the early hours of the 28th, I put in an order for $5000 at avg. 2.87, so I'm currently in the red. I got caught up in the frenzy over the day and didn't do as much DD as I usually do for even non-pennies. Now my skins in the game, time to do some analysis on how this might move.

*The Company*

This stock (As with most COVID stocks) are currently trading purely on technicals and no fundamentals (Posting continuous downwards revenue/losses YoY is enough to see that the company fundamentals don‚Äôt justify a price that‚Äôs over .50 cents), the company itself is also shaky, having been sued over misrepresentation of its role in combating Ebola (19m settlement). It is entirely possible that they are doing the same shit again with COVID, but the fact that there have been no announcements except for this partnership doesn‚Äôt seem to suggest they are bullshitting us round the block. They make plant-based vaccines as per client specification, with minimal R&amp;D on the part of developing the cure in the first place. 

Although I question whether 2 relatively small biopharma companies (iBio and their Chinese partners) can really outgun multi-billion dollar pharma in the race for the cure, them being in the race right now is more than enough to net big interest for the stock. 

For the 5th March shareholders meeting, I honestly don't know what to expect but predict some they either go down the Ebola route and lie about progress, show actual progress, or announce their acquisition. (All 3 of which would net gains in SP)

As of the 28th, the stock is netting a roughly 700% increase in the share price at its usual ""base"" level of $0.3 ish. It is good to see the AH hours not tanking, as this shows some confidence is still around the stock, and this is not a one day pump and dump affair, (although it is entirely possible this is a multiple day pump and dump affair, in which we ain't seen nothing yet. Trading volume on the 28th sitting at above 200m+ is a good sign that big guns are watching or are involved, but the fact that it kept hitting resistance on the 28th in the PM is making me question exactly how bullish the bulls are on this stock. It should be noted BlackRock (Yes, that BlackRock) owns 180k worth of shares acquired not too long before it exploded, and thus they may look to cash in soon, or they may want to blow this higher before cashing out. 

Comparing this with CODX (Which has an actual product that could work), the gain on CODX over the ""base level"" is currently 1300%, peaking at 2100% approximately a short while back.

It is entirely possible that this stock would blow past the 700% to hit past 1000% (Which was hit yesterday in the AM, right before the big crash (someone tanking the SP deliberately, no market forces involved) but due to the lack of any significant coverage or any progress report on any actual feasible product, I think the pure speculative hype around IBIO is not enough to get it to $20 or $30 or even $10 as some people are hoping. There is a lot of bullish sentiment on the stock by retail investors, however, there are also a lot of short positions, and thus, I'm uncertain, based on technicals alone, how this is going to go.

A lot of you had probably hoped that it would've ripped in the AH (So did I), but my guess is that a lot of big guys are cashing out on the profits made (holding from the .3-.5 levels), compounded by the weekend, + RHers and other weak hands letting go have slumped the AH performance somewhat (in addition to the Dow clawing back over the POTUS statements). I think the support level stays between 1.9-2 (barring any bullshit or market manipulation) and resistance being 2.8-3. 

Interesting to note is the S-3 filing, which seemingly has had no effect on the SP whatsoever, even if I personally do have some concern that if they throw all the shares into the market (considering the market cap as of 28th is about 180m, this would significantly dilute the SP) It must be noted the S-3 document is in relation to them having the right to ‚Äúshelve‚Äù and sell the securities from time to time, and thus what I think may happen is that they will drive the stock price more, prior to putting the shares on the market (to use the investors as an ATM per-se) shortly before it tanks. They also have a reverse-split to contend with, but since stock prices are way up, It is unclear whether this is going to happen or not. 

There is some extremely unsubstantiated information I read about on Stocktwit that suggests the March 5th shareholder meeting includes the disclosure of an acquisition of the company, and if that holds to be true, the stock can truly rip after that. (Take this with a grain of salt)

There is also currently an outstanding bid of 500k shares at price point 2.45 (consider AH closing at 2.07), and if that is true, then perhaps insiders know something we don‚Äôt, and this could also rip on this (presently unknown) information. (Also take this with a grain of salt).

*Market Sentiment:*

This is the fun part. COVID is now in full swing. The news of COVID is going from bad to worse. South Korea is done, and the United States is now in a borderline pandemic. In the past 24 hrs since market close, cases have been discovered to suggest extremely widespread transmission of COVID. 800 cases new cases in Korea, a bunch in Europe AND worst of all, mystery infections on the shores of the US. AND EVEN WORSE, it seems as though Humans are unable to produce a natural remedy to the COVID, judging by a bunch of people that got sick AGAIN after they were discharged in China. 

To say that Mondays open will be a sea of green would be beyond highly unlikely in my opinion. Institution investors are bracing for impact and its gonna hit way hard. (I had shares in AMD and all the growth stocks that just continually take a shit whenever bulls say it‚Äôs bottomed out) The Dow clawed back on the 28th because of the Feds and POTUS trying to drum up some market confidence by shouting fake news (and funnily enough, blaming the democrats) and introducing relief measures. This doesn‚Äôt stop stone-cold empirical numbers from instilling fear into millions. Living in a COVID struck area (Hong Kong), I know the damage this can create not only to supply chains and manufacturing but overall market sentiment, and willingness for people to go out, spend or do anything to contribute to the economy. Work from home also reduces productivity like a bitch, so be aware of this unforeseen impact on the economy.

I have sources in large Asian institutions that are confident that May/June will be the tipping point of rebound or entering a bearish market, completely dependent on whether the COVID dies off with the heat. (I think it will rebound)

All in all, this company SP is and will be based on market speculation and hype. I think the hype is somewhat warranted on the back of this disaster pandemic, and I think prices will top out $3.5-4 somewhere (with people panic buying if the Dow, again, is a sea of red this coming Monday) then tank, or soar if something comes out of the 5th of March meeting (maybe 6-8, but 10 would be a 3000% increase from base, and that seems a little high to me to ride off of sheer hype)

**I will be moving my money out if I‚Äôm green at open on Monday as I would have recouped my losses in the blue chips, but for all of you who are holding since pennies, I think the stock has someways to run. Wrote this fast, apologies for any errors.**

38,OGEN is on the move!,fbjoe4,RamzFanz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbjoe4/ogen_is_on_the_move/,1,19,"I've been meaning to remind everyone they are approaching P2 results. I didn't want to jump the gun because every one of you autists has A.D.D. and no patience, but I goofed. It shot up 40% Friday and AH.

I would absolutely still invest, especially on a dip. I'm adding on any major dip.

We have 3-5 weeks for results. It's an FDA FastTrack and EU orphan drug with no approved competition so conditional approval or approval with good P2 results is possible which is why I'm playing P2 and not waiting for P3. They do have a competitor in P3, but it's an injectable, not a rinse.

OGEN has AG013. It's an oral rinse that is expected to both prevent and cure Oral Muctosis, a common and painful symptom of both chemo and radiation treatment. OM has no current treatment other than numbing agents and OM often leads to treatment failure, it's that painful.

Major partnerships and/or a buyout is also more than likely, in my estimation. There are no rumors, I'm not pumping, the numbers just dictate this is probable.

The market is very conservatively valued at $750M annually and that's only assuming a 15% penetration. 15% is ridiculously low for a painful and incurable illness that can lead to an early death. If they had said 75%, I wouldn't balk. It could literally be prescribed for almost all chemo/radiation patients, worldwide. True story.

There are no know side effects.

It's also only being tested for OM. It is likely, because of the way it works, it may prevent/cure/abate many blistering mouth and skin diseases.

It's a lantibiotic. Lantibiotics are the future with antibiotic resistance becoming a major issue.

At less than $1, though, we all know there have to be downside risks.

Risks:

* They have competition in P3. It's an injectable so it's not much of a long term issue, but that could deter conditional approval or approval after P2.
* If P2 results are bad, which is not at all expected but is possible, this stock is dead. They have a large library of lantibiotics (over 400) and a few other drugs but those are years away from reviving this stock from bad results, if ever. Do or die!
* The market is complete shit and may dampen the anticipated run. Of course, it could also heighten it as profit-makers are hard to find. I don't have any idea.
* They are funded through late 2020. If they don't announce a partnership or buyout after results, expect dilution.

I'm not at all sure how I'm going to wrap this trade up. I will probably swing half of it repeatedly in the coming weeks and exit most of it before or just after P2 results. I don't want to be holding a big bag if it dilutes.",2020-02-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fbjoe4/ogen_is_on_the_move/
