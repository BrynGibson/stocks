Also penny stocks are a day trading kind of activity. If you cannot spend your day watching the computer it is not a game for you. If you expect to make a lot of money from it then you need to take huge agressive positions and then sell at a reasonable price. So, if you are hoping to make it big, treat it like gambling with money that you already consider lost. When you invest consider the money spent. So start with $25.00, see if you can make 20% on one trade. Then try another. If you can do this consistently with like ten trades, you have a good handle on price fluctuations. Also learn about limit orders and stop limit orders. Some penny stocks can be held for longer than a couple of minutes. And truthfully, since it doesn't sound like you have a ton of money true day trading is only legal for individuals with $25,000 and up currently in play. 

Learn to evaluate stocks for long term or short term growth by watching the news. 

A better option if you are worried about price would be to buy fractional shared from companies like Stockpile or Motif.
