*"" is pleased to announce the Company has expanded distribution into 4 new states, Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, and Utah where its popular Kona Gold Hemp Energy Drinks and HighDrate CBD Energy Waters will now be sold at local retail locations.

It's been a while since I've seen any talk about Kona Gold here, I know they peaked a few months back around ~$0.1494. I know that there was some people who were talking about being invested in the long haul, but I'm just curious where y'all are at on this now?

In the article they claim they're headed for another record quarter, and that their beverages are going to be entering into some chains soon. Given their growth so far it seems plausible.",2019-07-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cjbsxz/kgkg_expands_distribution_into_4_new_states/

5,Buy CTXR (Potential of $3),cjbb69,yeezus___christ,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cjbb69/buy_ctxr_potential_of_3/,2,1,"Potential Catalyst Triggers For CTXR
#1. As I mentioned earlier, CTXR displays 154% in upside potential to with an analyst provided ""Buy"" recommendation and a price target of $3.00.
So why does this alert show potential to climb to those levels? Well, one reason, it has a 52-Week high of $3.14, but keep reading.
#2. CTXR has seen its fair share of insider buying over the previous year.
According to a recent report from Simply Wall Street, ""Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 5.2m shares worth US$7.0m. In the last twelve months Citius Pharmaceuticals insiders were buying shares, but not selling.""
""It’s good to see that Citius Pharmaceuticals insiders have made notable investments in the company’s shares. In total, insiders bought US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and [the company] didn’t record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company’s future.""
Knowing that insiders appear to be ""all in"" on CTXR's future should give traders added confidence that share price growth could be right around the corner.
#3. Another thing to watch on CTXR is its Phase 3 clinical trials for Mino-Lok, an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).
Recent PR on Mino-Lok:
Citius Pharmaceuticals' Mino-Lok® Highly Efficacious in Rapidly Eradicating Candida auris
In Vitro Study at MD Anderson Cancer Center Labs Shows Mino-Lok Components to be Effective in Completely Eradicating All 10 Strains of Candida Auris Tested
CRANFORD, N.J., May 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Citius"") (Nasdaq: CTXR), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on adjunctive cancer care and critical care drug products, provided a report today on the in vitro efficacy of Mino-Lok against various strains of Candida auris.
Candida auris (""C. auris"") is a fungus that causes serious infections. C. auris can cause bloodstream infections and even death, particularly in hospital and nursing home patients with serious medical problems. More than 1 in 3 patients with invasive C. aurisinfection die. It's often resistant to most antifungal agents commonly used to treat Candida infections. Although C. auris was just discovered in 2009, it has spread quickly and caused infections in more than a dozen countries. Patients who have been hospitalized in a healthcare facility a long time, have a central venous catheter, or other lines or tubes entering their body, or have previously received antibiotics or antifungal medications, appear to be at highest risk of infection with this yeast.
Mr. Myron Holubiak, CEO of Citius, said, ""We are very enthused Mino-Lok has shown strong activity against a significant number of C. auris strains and that complete eradication occurred within an hour of exposure. Fortunately, our patients have not encountered any C. auris CLABSIs to date in our clinical trials. While these data for Mino-Lok are highly encouraging as they relate to Candida, in vitrodata do not necessarily correlate with clinical results; and, we recognize more work needs to be done. The company is currently studying Mino-Lok in a phase 3 trial in over 40 participating institutions, all located in the U.S.""
Blood stream infections due to Candida aurisare an emerging public health concern due to high prevalence of antifungal resistance and significant rates of patient mortality. C. auris is typically highly resistant; and, several strains have been identified with elevated MICs to all major classes of antifungals. Previously Citius reported that Mino-Lok was highly effective in clinical trials that evaluated salvage of catheters in patients with highly virulent bacterial infections. In this laboratory study, Mino-Lok was evaluated in its ability to eradicate C. auris in mature biofilms in vitrowithin an hour of exposure*.

If this antibiotic lock solution passes Phase 3 trials, it could be a giant momentum boost not only for the company, but also its share prices.
#4. CTXR's chart and technical indicators provide bullish signals for a possible upcoming breakout.
For the past month, CTXR has been on a steady climb from a $.93 low on June 27th to today's share price of $1.18.
Because of this slow grind up the charts, CTXR has now pushed through multiple layers of potential resistance, and in turn, may have now made these lines of support for a bigger push.
Currently, CTXR is bullishly trading above its:

5-Day Exponential Moving Average

13-Day Exponential Moving Average

20-Day Simple Moving Average

50-Day Simple Moving Average

Additionally, CTXR's 5-Day EMA is also trading above its 13-Day EMA in a bullish manner.
Now, here's where things get super interesting. Right now, CTXR is in a battle with is 200-Day Simple Moving Average ($1.20).
During Friday's session, we watched as that level was tested repeatedly early in the morning, but was not able to be broken down.
If traders pay attention to this stock come tomorrow and see the chart setup displaying a possible squeeze play, CTXR could see serious momentum flood into it.
When a stock starts trading above its 13-Day EMA, 50-Day SMA, and 200-Day SMA, it can be viewed as having a ton of chart support allowing for a potential move up the charts.
And, as I mentioned earlier, CTXR has a 52-week high of $3.14 and a low float, creating the possibility for 166% in upside potential.",2019-07-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cjbb69/buy_ctxr_potential_of_3/
