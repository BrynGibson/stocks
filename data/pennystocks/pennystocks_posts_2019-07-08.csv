&amp;#x200B;

CAMPBELL, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 8, 2019 / KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúKULR‚Äù), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management technologies, has partnered with Centre de Technologies Avanc√©es BRP-UdeS (CTA), a leading Quebec-based vehicle research organization, to provide its LYRA internal short circuit (ISC) battery testing device. The CTA plans to leverage KULR‚Äôs technology to enhance its ongoing research into the safety of electric vehicle battery systems for its tier-1 OEM clients. Due to the confidential nature of this contract, exact terms were not disclosed.

&amp;#x200B;

The LYRA ISC testing device, utilizing proprietary technology exclusively licensed to KULR by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and NASA, creates failures in lithium-ion battery cells in controlled laboratory conditions, uniquely enabling designers and researchers to study methods to reduce failures and design systems to mitigate their consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

The failures triggered by the LYRA ISC replicate cell failure defects in batteries, which can be some of the most common, serious, and difficult cell failures to detect using traditional battery testing methods, presenting risks to a wide variety of commercial and consumer battery applications. The LYRA ISC received the prestigious R&amp;D100 Award in 2016 and was the runner-up NASA Invention of the Year in 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWe are truly excited to collaborate with the CTA team to advance their electric vehicle research and engineering efforts. We expect our collaboration will provide the CTA with the necessary tools to further designs for their tier-1 partners, while steering them towards better, safer thermal management solutions,‚Äù said Michael Mo, Chief Executive Officer of KULR Technology Group. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made a concerted effort towards making our LYRA ISC devices more widely available, allowing OEMs to better understand the risks associated with their current battery safety systems. As a next step, we are also working towards establishing a comprehensive battery design and testing methodology, which will be based on our robust portfolio of battery safety technologies.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAs an established leader in next-generation vehicle research efforts, CTA is pleased to work with the incredible team at KULR to characterize and test our energy storage designs in ways not previously possible,‚Äù said √âric M√©nard, Electric Programme Manager at CTA. ‚ÄúWe look forward to leveraging the LYRA ISC technology to better understand and improve the behaviors of our electric vehicle innovations.‚Äù

ORLANDO, Fla., July 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AVRA Medical Robotics, Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (OTCQB: AVMR), an emerging company developing a proprietary software coded system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for the purpose of creating the next generation of fully autonomous medical robotic systems, announced today that its Chief Strategy Officer, D. Nikhil Shah, delivered a presentation at this year‚Äôs Annual Meeting of the Society of Robotic Surgery. The meeting took place June 20-23 in Orlando, FL.  


Barry Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ‚ÄúI was extremely pleased that we were able to share the AVRA story at this year‚Äôs meeting of the Society of Robotic Surgery. The audience was able to learn about how AVRA is currently developing proprietary algorithms along with specialized software to develop a semi-autonomous operating medical class robot, which should have a relatively quick path to commercialization. Such a device will be a vital solution for our initial market of aesthetics, which focuses on the skin, the largest organ of the human body that experiences many problems that require detailed attention by today‚Äôs dermatologists and aestheticians. In addition, our longer-term goal is to then leverage these technologies and create a fully intelligent system with built-in imaging and software programs to offer complete autonomy for medical robotics.‚Äù",2019-07-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/caov0j/avmr_avra_medical_robotics_announces_its/
