I noticed a lot of people say blanket statements like be diligent, research, and try to better yourself. Please add ONLY straightforward logical solutions for watching and investing penny stocks. This is what I do, feel free to add.

My Post market Checklist:

1. Check if the stock gapped up: why did so many people invest in this stock? Is it a pump and dump based on P/E ratio? 

2. What is the volatility? Is it unpredictable behavior or does it have a reliable news cataliyst in the past to validate a good entry point with a market stop or breaking point?

3. What is the short float percentage. Anything over 20% I wouldn't invest long. Also learn to read a balance sheet for SEC filings!

4. What is the CEOs reputation I invested in OPK and I wish I did more research. Always check your CEOs history.

5. What is my game plan? For the most part I lean towards getting cash and not getting caught holding the bag. Day trading requires 25K US cash and a more experienced  trader. I typically enjoy week trading. 

6. What my exit strategy? What is my loss limit before I say the trend is over and I have lost. Cutting losses does not make you a pansy. If you don't know when to walk you are no different from a gambling casino addict. 

7. Please add your own advice below. No long stories or fluff just evidence for a logical investment. Thanks",2020-03-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fs6dsy/penny_stock_checklist/

53,AYTU SABBY and Armistice capital,fsfupz,mysonbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsfupz/aytu_sabby_and_armistice_capital/,11,58,"Interesting information that i have discovered. 

Sabby bought 6 million shares worth $11 million at $1.84. They purchased on 3/12/2020

Armistice capital bought 5 million shares on 3/10/2020. It does not give a price for that but my guess it is close to Sabby's price.

If you do the math, they both are down about $2 million right now because of the drop. 

Now you might ask why aren't they buying more?- The answer is because they probably can't. I'm willing to bet the FDC gave them a date and said: ""You are allowed to buy shares up to this point, after that you aren't allowed"". My guess is because they have insider information, and they know that this will explode in price. 

I think there is no way Sabby and Armistice bought into AYTU blindly and said let's shoot in the dark and see if this stock would hit. 

O. and also Steven Boyd, Armistice capital CEO is on the board of directors of AYTU.

Hey guys I see people talk about investing in oil companies and a bounce back has to happen, the truth is many of these companies won’t secure loans and will have to liquidate. Do your research before investing don’t follow trends. Many of these companies no matter how big or small from CHK to CPE will probably file bankruptcy or liquidate. Beware of the energy industry because it’s just going to get worse.",2020-03-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fso50s/oil_companies/

114,Hope for $AYTU news soon...,fsmmy8,TransSpeciesDog,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fsmmy8/hope_for_aytu_news_soon/,3,22,"Just relaying the information...

&gt;The first PR about the test exclusivity on 3/10 stated that the first shipment would arrive in 3-4 weeks. Then, on 3/23, their PR stated that it would arrive that week (which was last week). Looking at [import records](https://twitter.com/pakman452/status/1245093701900263427/photo/1)... I see that a cargo ship arrived from Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech last Friday, 3/27, in Los Angeles. Perhaps the other shipments were for other products and not the test for AYTU. If this 3/27 shipment is indeed AYTU'S, perhaps that's the reason for the delay in PR. It does fit with the timeline that they have been consistent with in their PRs. That's my only offer of hope for everyone.
