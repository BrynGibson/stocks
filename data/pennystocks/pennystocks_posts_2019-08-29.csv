CAMPBELL, Calif., Aug. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**KULR Technology Group**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q21O1ZE9DfP1Pf2rRcfKo-U7JbLC3imWF8mBWpuIkLNu-9Rw-GCZoGI5PJpXhtp7JDZb5mhBxukXVjrqsJ9TknjXr6kNCtyggbX5suIstBU=), Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) (the “Company” or “KULR”), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management and battery safety technologies, announced today that its [**Internal Short Circuit**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yL8LYQj-tGpT_BIRivO9m6goPtDan_UgyLVExrGp8tOrk40RCS9BipwIQ0qsrJ-tmLjtYRwRbODziE8dubNzkffITlEYR2CCBTRfIB9gIs7NDv-uWUwOc1kABiEzBHG2SXQP3S4BJ1K-xnSJtvSIng==) (ISC) device will be required by the Navy Sea Systems Command to test the safety and storage of battery designs for planned use in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV).  The requirements to use KULR’s ISC were outlined in a [**Request for Information**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zcS51hKrRfWAbGCW7BjijR93tSbUGRYgTJcTfB1xC8Snq9kqhWPUXcMaVrJbUx-6OiNWm_pbHHVx1B2VTxqfYvvArwsjMexPiUM1LsVKlf0LZhxsJLRHiNILENQ_ufpNZTxVgmtUx1ueIb19ey5Vnz9tVlU3iZOilM2HcRA-9rW7mPZooHKyuPeZyMkzPhvfTbOPxUL3Qq0MZxSE5pSFveNuLjeyTLjs1yUs7KhyRRo=) (RFI) released by the Navy earlier this month.  


The Navy’s RFI is “seeking organization\[s\] that are potentially interested in screening lithium-ion cells for high reliability, critical applications” as well as storing those cells for future use in, “large lithium-ion battery systems for Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) applications.” 

The RFI specifies that responding organizations should be able to “generate small batches of reliable and repeatable trigger cells (e.g., cells imbedded with the NREL/NASA internal short circuit device, available through a partnership with KULR Technologies, exclusive licensee for the device).” The RFI says, “These ""trigger cells"" are needed for verification and validation of the safety of battery designs…”

“KULR is pleased to have the ISC technology be the safety and validation testing solution for the NAVY battery reserve program,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR Technology. “It validates our long and successful history of working with government and industry experts to design and deploy the most comprehensive battery testing and safety platforms possible.”

In addition to the ISC, KULR also provides other leading battery safety and storage solutions including its patented [**HYDRA TRS**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pvKlm8gW475iJFm3tGOSDyWlVViipU7N4Dkmd98WKkpxIgrmu6XvjHi6suVa3zYp99s6O7Xbw98l0O0zOAplu8KjJqHDl4oEZikALi8UGc0ToU95aSm-7-gfEfEqOzkZ) technology. The TRS, developed with NASA and other partners, has been proven in testing to reduce the risks of thermal propagation fires and explosions in battery packs, making them ideal for shipping and storage.
