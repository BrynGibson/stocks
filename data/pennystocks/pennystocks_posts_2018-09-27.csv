WESTON, Florida, September 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC: PYTG) announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (""NxGen Brands"") - specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products.

Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies.

CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states ""These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far - all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell.

Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue."" He continues on to add, ""I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018

Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY).

In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:   

  

HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.”

CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.”

Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora.

INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

TORONTO, ON, Sept. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Easton Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OTC: [EAPH](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bD26I3NzIrkAy_3j4OJps6v1iT615C0HNLecnsCmvBwVIRDzUBRKzruRaeQz3aou708bWQk64P5LzuYKlWOyOMoFVfFQu1xK8s8-6BzEv54=)) is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement on the main terms to take over an operating boutique hotel and real estate asset in the heart of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.   


After several weeks of negotiations, Easton has reached a consensus on the main terms that will form the final agreement whereby Easton will take ownership of an operating Boutique Hotel located on Bay Street in the heart of Toronto’s Financial District and the City’s main tourist attractions. Once the transaction is completed, Easton has plans in place that will increase revenues to over $8,000,000 per year, which it intends to implement shortly after closing. The property currently has a value in excess of $17,000,000 CDN and its coveted location makes it a prime re-development opportunity for residential condominiums / office space and hotel at some point in the future. Easton expects to have a final agreement signed by October 16, 2018 or shortly thereafter notwithstanding any unforeseen delays on other minor terms still to be agreed to. Full details on property location and business will be made available shortly or once the transaction is completed and approved.

In other news, Easton is in the final stages of negotiations to be the majority partner or participate in another operating Casino in the United States that currently has existing revenues and profits. Easton hopes to finalize and close on both the Toronto Hotel and the operating casino in the near term while it also negotiates on other similar potential transactions in Europe brought forward through Easton CEO, Mr. Evan Karras and his extensive relationships. Updates on both projects will be disclosed as they are made available and approved for release.

In other news, a court hearing on the Georgina property permit dispute with the township of Georgina, located in Ontario, Canada was adjourned by the township on September 13th with a new court date to soon be set. Easton and its partner Alliance (o/s 1124123 Ontario Inc.) jointly own a 135-acre property which is currently zoned for aggregate and recycling, but the township stopped its soil operations which started in June of this year, following a court order. Easton / Alliance believe it has a strong argument and will seek damages in the millions of dollars for lost revenues. Updates will be disclosed once they are available and approved for release.

&amp;#x200B;

BATON ROUGE, La., Sept. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCQB:OBMP) (""OncBioMune"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of a proprietary immunotherapy cancer vaccine technology and targeted cancer therapies, today provides a status update on the Phase 2 clinical trial of ProscaVax for early-stage prostate cancer.  The Company is pleased to report that initial installments for the study have been made and the final preparations culminating in enrollment are being completed between Theradex Oncology, the Contract Research Organization overseeing the study, and the host hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard University Medical School in Boston, MA.  


ProscaVax is OncBioMune’s lead immunotherapy platform candidate consisting of a combination of prostate cancer associated prostate specific antigen (PSA) with the biological adjuvants interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).  Per study protocol, approximately 120 patients are expected to be enrolled.  The patients will be in what is termed “active surveillance,” a disease management option for patients with localized prostate cancer that elect to work with their doctor to monitor the disease for progression before taking more drastic intervention measures, such as surgery or radiotherapy.  To the Company’s knowledge, the trial of ProscaVax is the first ever worldwide for a prostate cancer vaccine technology addressing the active surveillance patient population.

“Our excitement is growing as we draw closer to enrollment.  We (our Company and the host hospital) have already fielded inquiries from prostate cancer patients interested in participating in the study, which is an encouraging sign about recruitment once the trial is opened,” commented Dr. Jonathan Head, Chief Executive Officer at OncBioMune.  “We think the interest is owed to the strong safety profile and meaningful immunological effect demonstrated in the Phase 1 study of ProscaVax in advanced-stage prostate cancer patients and the simple fact that there are no FDA-approved therapeutic options for the tens of thousands of active surveillance patients that want to be proactive in addressing their cancer.  We believe that ProscaVax has a lot to offer these patients and potential future partners as the only vaccine of this type.”

In preparation for the trial and other pipeline developments, the Company has taken measures to clean its balance sheet, including recently retiring $900,000 in convertible, floorless debt.  Management is currently in negotiations with its lenders and accredited investors to secure additional funding structured under attractive terms, including preferred stock and fixed-rate convertible debentures.

**About Prostate Cancer**

According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men other than skin cancer, with about 1 in 9 men diagnosed during their lifetime.  ACS estimates that about 164,690 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed during 2018 and approximately 29,430 men will die from the disease this year.  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, trailing only lung cancer.  Approximately 2.9 million men are living with prostate cancer today.  The average age of diagnosis is 66, with the disease considered rare in men under the age of 40.

18,$AVEO - Aveo Pharma DD,9jf0op,Chill_Duck_,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9jf0op/aveo_aveo_pharma_dd/,12,2,"#**$AVEO – Aveo Pharmaceuticals**

**Overview:**

Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.

The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. 

Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.


**Pipeline:**

With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.

**Oncology**

Tivozanib:

*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)

*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)

*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)


Ficlatuzumab:

*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)

*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)

*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)


AV-203:

*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)


**Non-Oncology**

Ocular Form:

*AMD (Preclinical)

AV-308:

*Cachexia (Preclinical)

AV-353

*PAH (Preclinical)


While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.


**Specific Drug:**

Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.


To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:

VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;

VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,

VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.


With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.

TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  

When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.

Tivozanib – P = 0.034

Axitinib – P=0.908

Pazopanib – P=0.354

Sorafenib – P=0.427

Sunitinib – P=0.002


As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.

The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 

In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. 

For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. 

Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  

Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. 


**Current Market:**

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.

While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.

Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.


**Financials:**

Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  


**Review:**

I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  

I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.


#**TLDR**

This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.
