If the price for ADXS hits $1, it’ll automatically trigger a sell at the best possible price for 107 shares. 

Do you use Robinhood?  If so, when you go to sell, you can select the type of transaction you’d like to set up prior to selling. There are several options, one of which is a stop loss. 

That said, you still have to be sort of careful not to set the stop loss so high that you accidentally sell before you’d actually want to.  

Depends on the typical size of the swings of your given stock.",2020-01-02

190,stranger_freak,fcwhw4m,/r/pennystocks/comments/eiuani/this_group_is_awsome/fcwhw4m/,1,"Oh, I wish I had the best answer for you.

I have a stop loss on INPX of $0.20. I picked that number because it’s low enough that I don’t think it’s likely to trigger by an accidental temporary swing that rebounds 5 minutes later, and I got in at $0.08, so I can be happy with a profit of $0.12/share. 

I will say that, in my opinion, I don’t think it hurts to set a stop-loss on a stock equal to your purchase price (or a penny higher to allow for some drop while it tries to sell your shares). At least that way the odds of you suddenly losing out on a stock that has made some gains are basically nothing. 

For instance, since I bought INPX at $0.08, I should at least have a stop loss set at $0.09 so that I can’t lose money on it, only (more-or-less) break even. 

That said, this isn’t effective for when you first get into a stock and there’s no room between its current price and your purchase price. If you buy in at $0.08 and it’s at $0.09 and you set a stop loss at $0.08, it’s probably going to trigger very quickly just through small fluctuations. 

Of course, all of this is obviously just my opinion and you’ll have to decide what’s best for you. Like you, I’m pretty new to this as well (started in September). 

Good luck!",2020-01-02

It peaked so much over the last few days that it hit the major bottom of Aug 12-13 where it dropped almost 50% in a single day.  .34-.42 range is Major resistance.  It shows that level was in play today as it struggled to get higher than that.

A Fib retracement at key levels lines up very nicely at the previous highs and lows in the last few days.  It dropped a lot after hours into the .24 range for awhile, sorry if this isnt exactly accurate.  Tradingview doesn't chart after hour activity and I only looked at it once or twice around 4pm when I was getting ready to leave work.  If the retracement continues it could easily hit .18 (Stopping just above the Dec 18th High) or continue down to the previous day of .11 If it continues to rally it needs to break .44, if it does the next level to sell would be around .77
