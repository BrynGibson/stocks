From their servers to their tools/resources down to their customer service. I have been noticing that they're much stricter than other brokers when it comes to penny stocks. I understand it makes complete sense for a broker to protect themselves (and their investors) but I feel as though they have purposefully made it so that their members steer away from pennies and volatile ETFs. 

I would like to look into this more with your help but let's just use one example for now. $SCO has been made non-marginable through Schwab. TD Ameritrade (not merged yet) still has it for 100% margin maintenance. Robinhood however has it for 60%. I have enough equity to trade non-marginable stocks BUT the T+2 rule really limits the amount of entries I can have. 

I also suspect that if I checked the margin maintenance on all of the small-mid cap morning gappers I would find that Schwab will always come in higher or even non-marginable.

The man's dedication to warning us about ""Bozo Berman"" all day, every day, was remarkable, albeit, odd. His daily ramblings, dissuading us to invest in DECN, going as far back as 2016 had me convinced that he was possibly mentally retarded, or at least suffering from an obsessive compulsive disorder or something. 
So, like many others I ignored him. I invested most of my hard earned cash into this endeavor, along with most of my 401k. 

Now, I need to explain to my wife and her boyfriend that *yours truly* yolo'd everything they had into a company with a 1997 Angelfire website, fronted by a man named Bozo Berman with a questionable past who claimed to have a *game changing* product that even the FDA couldn't comprehend. I'm dead.

9,DECN Test Kits,g84paj,AspiringPhysician7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g84paj/decn_test_kits/,1,12,"I know DECN is being investigated by SEC for some bold claims and possibly due to a massive sell-off a few days ago. I want to focus this post on the testing aspect because as a future healthcare provider, I am very interested in the technology that they claim to have ""perfected"" and I aspire to give my patients the best care that I can. 

So let's jump into it, DECN claim to have perfected their technology because they use their electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in their glucose meters and they are recalibrating it for detection of coronavirus, which is not as crazy as one would think after looking into it.

I have been doing some research because there is a lot of misunderstanding of what DECN's test kits actually are.

* **Test Kit #1** (currently pending FDA approval). This is a test kit for hospitals, labs, and clinics to use. This test uses a technology called electrical impedance. This is how I imagine it. There is a circuit and electricity is running through it at a certain voltage and frequency. Now once you add things to that circuit (such as a blood sample) that will cause some sort of resistance and using the Ohm's Law (Voltage=Current\*Resistance), we know that will cause a change in the voltage that is produced. This is the reason why the results come out so fast because it's literally electrons running through the circuit. (Please correct me if I am wrong. I would love to learn more about this technology). Now the reason why this is important is that different types of microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and etc... cause a different amount of resistance. Based on how much resistance is changed is how they can distinguish, in this case, if you have coronavirus or not.
* **Test Kit #2** (going to file with the FDA before 5/1). This uses the same technology as above and is going to be an at-home test kit. **TK#1** and **TK#2** ARE NOT serology tests. They are NOT looking for antibodies. They are looking for the presence of the coronavirus in red blood cells that have been lysed (cut open) which I assume happens when the voltage runs through the blood sample in the device.

Now that has been cleared up, let's move on to the perfection of this ""technology."" I DO NOT KNOW if they have truly perfected it. I will, however, say that there have been scientific studies (which I will link below) that show that this technology can be compared to the sensitivity (correctly detect positive result) and specificity (correctly detect negative result) of PCR. With that said, there are some limitations to what I have come across.

1. Study #1 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088225/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088225/)) This study used nasal samples (not blood, I know different sample type) to assess the at what concentration they could detect the presence of different microorganisms (they used it for MERS-CoV and not for COVID-19). With that said, if you read at graphical abstract... you can see a diagram that looks VERY SIMILAR to that used in the GENVIRO product.
2. Study #2 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/)) This study is the CLOSEST one that I have found to our actual product technology. The only issue is they did not use it to detect this coronavirus because this study came out before COVID-19 was around. It does not take away from the fact that this technology COULD POSSIBLY BE used to detect COVID-19 if more studies support it.
3. Study #3 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21872621](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21872621)) This study is the shortest to read of the 3, but they were assessing the avian flu (H5N2). With this study, they found that electrical impedance was very COMPARABLE to PCR. They got their results within an hour whereas rRT-PCR (this is how most swab tests are being run) would take much longer (several hours to possibly days).

What's the takeaway? More studies need to be done to see if electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to detect COVID-19. Also, more studies on COVID-19 need to be done, because these studies I have came across are looking at different types of viruses. From my research, I am not seeing detection in 15 seconds, but I have seen some authors claim within minutes. However, with that said, it's possible that DECN may have this technology ""perfected"" with their colleagues in South Korea.

At this point, it's really up in the air if this product has the capability to back up it's **bold** (see what I did there) claims.

UAVS is a tiny company in comparison to Amazon, but that’s exactly who is getting the ground delivery contracts, so if they keep consistent with their methods of ground delivery operation, it is very possible that UAVS could be just one of multiple small drone companies coming in to begin drone delivery in the same fashion as they have been doing ground delivery for years.

20,Some thoughts on AYTU...,g8ktnw,TransSpeciesDog,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g8ktnw/some_thoughts_on_aytu/,1,29,"If you've been watching AYTU, then you already know that good news seems to drop the share price a couple of cents and bad news seems to raise it a couple of cents. It's an overgeneralization, I know, but the point is that up until now news hasn't seemed to have had any significant effect on AYTU's SP. 

Now it's different. This company is caught up in the middle of a political tug-o-war. Whether or not AYTU's UV-light thingy does what it says it does, or if their COVID-19 tests are as accurate as they are purported to be, this company has been elevated to the national spotlight. Their ability to produce a successful product is temporarily irrelevant to their brand. From being mentioned on Fox News on Friday, to this whole censorship debacle—*AYTU published a promotional video about their UV-light product on YouTube and because the mere existence of this UV-light treatment has the potential to refute the official narrative which casts the President's previously mentioned idea of using UV-light to treat COVID-19 as silly and ridiculous, The Peanut Gallery is invested in making sure they don't have egg all over their faces by reporting the video to YouTube and Twitter for ""content violations,"" which subsequently led to AYTU's Twitter account being suspended (and unsuspended and then resuspended, but I digress, I'm not really paying that close of attention to it). This has both the Red Gang and the Blue Gang up in arms on the internet battlefront. One side claiming the other side ""wants censorship because orange man bad"" and the other side claiming ""the UV-light treatment is disinformation designed to make orange man look good.""—*this is mostly likely only going to be good for AYTU's SP, regardless of what side you belong to (or if you just impale yourself on the middle-most fence post as I do).

Neither the company's efficacy nor their ability to produce profit is going to matter in the next few days. Public perception of AYTU is going to be the sole driving factor in its SP. And, as of right now, it definitely appears to me that the perception of AYTU is generally positive (full disclosure: this may be informed by my bias as I am holding about 2500 shares). I say this because I put stock in Joe Rogan's ability to affect the perception of both gangs and he recently retweeted someone griping about AYTU's recent battle with censorship to his 6+ million followers. To reiterate, AYTU is front and center right now and I contend most people have a positive perception about the company.

If I had to guess, I would say that we'll see AYTU go above $2 in the immediate future, and possibly up to or surpassing its 52-week high ($2.99) by the end of the week. And if the President tweets or mentions AYTU's name? Please know that I don't type this lightly: **to the frickin' moon!** (Ironically, a few weeks ago I read a comment on this sub which stated ""President Trump could tweet about AYTU and its SP would still go no where."" I laughed and enjoyed the satire, but who knows? Maybe we'll get to see what would actually happen.)

Once again, all of this could be just wishful thinking from an AYTU bag holder, but to elaborate more on my point of view: All of the information I have presented here comes from the viewpoint of a former journalist, trained at one of the top journalism schools in the country, who has practiced the bloodsport that is journalism for years. I'm still a noob as far as trading stocks goes, but I consider myself to be born out of the media lifecycle.

I dont support the far left or right but im not going to rule out the possibility that the uv light will work. Looks like people are finally hearing about aytu. Breitbart just released article explaing censorship of the aytu youtube and twitter accounts. Washington time just release article about trump suggesting uv light can kill virus. Both mentioned aytu by name and it looks like this may blow up soon. I hate breitbart but im not ruling out possibility this might be helpful. Either ways, this hype will bring a pump. I see this week climbing high. Good luck everyone.
