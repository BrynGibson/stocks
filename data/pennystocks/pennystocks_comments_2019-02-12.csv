 I think everyone got caught up in the overall selling of the market and these tanked further than they should have. Earnings is coming up next week I believe for $CLD so that should be a good indicator. I'm holding 15k shares, so a shot over $1 would be some pretty nice returns.",2019-02-12

I don't know why so many people on this sub don't get this.  

It's not the first company.  There are multiple per year.  Granted, it's rare to see these type of quick gains in a week/two weeks, but you still see a handful of companies that are legit go from a couple pennies or less to a dollar plus within several months to a year.  

You can find them with research and DD.  

Trade those pump and dumps day to day.  Use those profits to take chances on companies like SHMP.  That's my strategy.

Do you want to go long or short? do you want to do day trades or swing trades or invest? Learn the lingo. 

Do you have any expertise in any field? It can be useful to figure out what stocks may be useful (just be careful of insider trading).

PUT YOUR RESEARCH INTO YOUR INVESTMENTS. Don't just do it because people online say to do it, read up on the company, read what both bears and bulls have to say about it. Figure out what the plans of the board/CEO are in their public statements. For example one company I've invested in brought on an exec known for getting the companies she works for bought out. 

Don't touch option until you really understand what they do and the risks involved. Although buying them to execute them (calls especially) could be a good place to start learning about them. 

Maybe consider using Robinhood or WeBull. It's not perfect but trades cost nothing to execute which can be good if you don't have much to invest with. ",2019-02-12

But I do think you can be smart about it.  I do think you can make money flipping on the otc, I've consistently done a few hundred a week for around a year now.  You're never going to make ""real"" money though if you don't take at least a few chances on stocks like SHMP.  

Once in a while, you still have to take a chance on certain stocks, even if there's a possibility of it being a pump in dump.  

In those cases, set a stop loss, and still walk away with a few thousand or more.  

I'm not looking to ""get rich"" on the otc.  

I'm using it to supplement my income.  If I can put an extra 10 grand towards the principle of my mortgage every year, and maybe pay for a couple long weekend trips plus a cruise per year from otc trading....then I'm a happy man.  And so far I've been able to do that.  

And on certain stocks like this, I'll take an extra risk to maybe make 10 grand, even if it turns out to be a pump and dump and instead of making 4k I make 2k with my stop loss.

I would grab a bunch of well known companies you personally know.  Try not to invest in anything you haven't heard of. Companies like Microsoft, Roku, Square, Amazon, Home Depot, Chipotle, EA, Boeing, etc.

If you are set on doing some pennies try to keep it to a small portion of the portfolio such as 5-10%.

I've now learned to think about outstanding shares, authorized shares and how the stock price floating under $1 for long enough might force the company to do a reverse stock split. I learned about the split and wow does that suck. 

If it gets to a dollar, then I could pullout and make 10k or so, based on a 100 reverse stock split. I don't think it will ever be as popular a format as snapchat, which I think is at $8 bucks a share.

Today I also learned that there is a thing called ask/bid for which a company will be asking for more per share than what the live price is, and will want to buy for less then the live price too. 

And today I learned, that I need to look at share structure and do more homework before making a move. That $100 is going to sit there and be a reminder of that. ",2019-02-12

I feel that penny stocks are a different beast entirely and have a higher penalty for error. I've seen toxic stocks on my watch list become delisted and go into the grey market, basically making your shares null and void. Investing in the triple-zeros (.000x stock price) is very speculative and high risk, with .0001 usually being the death throes of a toxic investment. Its difficult to find people who want to trade 1s and 2s and for any real volume or momentum to develop. I will say that I did trade FDBL about a year and a half ago when it was trading within certain higher ranges and had decent volume, but I did so under the assumption that the management team behind them was really lacking. I wouldn't personally recommend a stock that's trading in the .0001 to .0003 range unless it comes under new management and seems to be rebranding, but even then it's very high risk because that could very likely be smoke and mirrors.

Hope this is helpful at all, best of luck. Penny stocks will always be the wild west, stay vigilant and learn what you can.",2019-02-12

I opened my trading account a while back but haven’t even made my first trade yet. Although I am really excited to start, I feel very overwhelmed with all the information and different terms out there. There are so many different things to invest in I am not sure what to look for. 
I have $500 CAD as a sort of “trial fund” that I am willing to part with if it means learning something. I am conscious that I won’t make millions my first trade but I would like to know where to start! 
Any advice?

Thanks ",2019-02-12
