Post I made a little while back. GLFH - check it out. I posted some DD in there. It’s realllllly been picking up momentum and people are playing games and setting up walls (real and today a fake 2.5k wall from ETRF *of all MMs* that was hit for like 200k shares). 

It’s hovering at .2399 I think right now. This thing trades on air and we are all waiting for the 10Q to pop out. This isn’t a “let’s make 100% every day” stock. This is a load up and hold for the heat stock - something very RARE in the stinky pinks. Just check the chart, but most importantly check their filings. It’s all there. Good day bud ",2018-05-01

Tim Cook from Apple sold a ton of shares in 2016. Does that mean he isn't confident in Apple's future? No, he sold shares to get money. Simple as that. In the end lots of CEO's sell shares and it doesn't mean they don't have faith in the company. Now if a CEO sold all the shares they own I would be little worried but not too much.

This being said I too was worried many months back when I saw a CEO from a different company sell a ton of the shares they own. So I looked up some stuff online about CEO selling shares. I do not remember clearly but I think lots of times a CEO has to plan ahead of time when to sell their shares. So it may just be that the CEO decided a while back to sell some shares at this time with no secret meaning to it besides just wanting some extra cash. 

Not to mention he is the CEO so I am certain he will be rewarded with more shares at some point. Especially if the company does well. ",2018-05-01
