I'm not sure why people keep bringing up the 5th of each month. The FDA releases the list of approved devices from the previous month on that date. The news can come at any time and AKERS is firmly in the window of releasing that news.

https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/ucm070201.htm

There is a link to the FDA process above. AKERS received the 'Additional Information' request in December and released a press release stating ""Sooner rather than later"" on January 31st. They most likely responded to the request very very quickly as that would have been priority number 1. Based on that, they most likely responded by January 1st but to be safe, we won't even use that date.

They were already on FDA Day 60 by getting the 'Additional Information' request so lets start the clock on January 31st b/c that article would indicate they had already responded. By FDA Day 90, the FDA has to provide the official decision. Let's only count business days.

January 31st - 30 days out would be March 14th. You'd be crazy to think the actual response went out on the same day as the press release. Link below:

GlobeNewswire•March 6, 2018
BEVERLY HILLS, CA, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTC: RCHA), is a Biopharmaceutical Company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology using its study drug RP-323 (TPA). Multiple clinical studies have shown a significant increase in WBCs in patients with solid tumors who suffered from low WBCs counts, and the studies show that RP-323 plays a major part in the developmental processes that are vital to many patients’ treatment and recovery.

""In one of the studies with 52 patients, all but one of the patients treated with an infusion of our drug TPA increased the number of WBCs, some significantly.  We know that WBCs are key to fighting disease and are vital to many patients' treatment and recovery,"" said Rich Pharmaceuticals CEO Ben Chang. 

“Physicians become concerned if the number of WBCs fall or rise out of the healthy range since they help fight infections by attacking bacteria, viruses, and germs.  Having a higher or lower number of WBCs may be an indication of an underlying condition,” explained Mr. Chang. “The ability to regulate WBC is a key element in immunotherapy.  Immunotherapy is the treatment that stimulates your body’s own immune system to help fight cancer.”
