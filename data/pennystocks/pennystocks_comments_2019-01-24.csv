This basically is at least 250,000$  of revenue could be up to 500,000. I think it‚Äôs more around 300k area. Next, to refill the Contrapest it‚Äôs 35$ a unit. Then you have feedlot contracts that will add lots of revenue. In addition you have wildlife reserves in Hawaii which is big money. And finally you have home and managers of neighborhoods that have many different houses. These will have giant money as well. A bunch of city‚Äôs are already using it.

Also, their website is not meant for Ecommerce so that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt purchase product off of their website. I recommend giving them a call, the CEO is extremely nice and takes the time to answer all your questions.

2. The CEO did NOT buy his own company. I‚Äôm not sure where you got that from? The CEO of Rotmans merged with Vystar to manufacture the latex in house since much of the product offerings used Vytex latex and since Rotmans also distributed through NHS. The CEO of Rotman was then appointed CEO of Vystar.

3. I can‚Äôt speak to the update of information on the OTC website. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not updated. They probably should to ease shareholder confidence.

4. The purpose of mattress-in-a-box is for the convenience of transporting and not necessarily shipping to anyone and anywhere. I‚Äôm sure in the near future, they will offer their product all across the US but they just started. Give it time.

Containment of the liquid. Stations need to be secured and locked. There are some players already out there that own this market. They will need to integrate their product to fit into more rodent ‚Äústations.‚Äù 

This product doesn‚Äôt kill rodents. They still feed, defecate, and cause damage. The rodenticides that mentioned in other comments are cheaper and VERY effective. There are plenty of different rodenticide options out there.  If this product is used I‚Äôd imagine they would have to also actively use snap traps along with it. 

The industry isn‚Äôt quick with ‚Äúchange‚Äù. People that have been trapping and poisoning rodents for years, aren‚Äôt just going to switch. The first thing they will ask, is if it the product kills the rodent.
