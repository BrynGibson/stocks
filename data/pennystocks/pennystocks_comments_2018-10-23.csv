There was a research note released by Zacks on 10/12/18 downgrading the stock to a ""sell"" rating, yet for some reason that news is appearing all over the internet *today*. Even so, right now bids and asks are up higher from the closing price yesterday, and the stock climbed 18% after hours yesterday. This is a promising company because the unique nano-technology that they're implementing in their CBD beverage ""Lalpina"" is currently unchallenged in a booming sector, plus that sell rating could possibly give you an excellent entry point if it indeed does sell off today. Take a look at the chart. It's definitely bullish long-term, and many investors seem to be holding with strong hands. As an added side note, the CEO is currently having multiple meetings with big names, and HIPH is appearing more and more in press releases and articles, one in particular being mentioned alongside names like New Age Beverages, Canopy Growth Corp, and Aurora Cannabis.
