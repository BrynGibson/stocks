17,Finarel,e6m4zur,/r/pennystocks/comments/9irprf/when_is_a_penny_stock_considered_investable/e6m4zur/,1,"The very vast majority of the penny stocks are just Pump and Dumps. That is what the previous posers are referring to: stocks that hire promoters to move the stock, and then the promoters dump all their shares. You can see that very clearly on the charts: one huge spike upwards that seems to come out of nowhere followed by an equal spike downwards. It’s almost as if it was a mountain.

That said, there are actual businesses down there, but you must look for verifiable information. A great example of this is AMFE.

AMFE owns Snakes&amp;Lattes, Natural Stuff Inc, GROZONE and Interlock Kings. They are 4 separate subsidiaries but the real gem, the one making the most revenue is Snakes&amp;Lattes. They have already reported 11 million in revenues in the last 3 quarters, the numbers of the 4th quarter are set to be released this month.

They recently also released a multi year audit, which is a requisite for up listing from the Pinks to the OTCQB. You can verify all this information on OTCmarkets.com

If you want to find where to invest I would ask myself the following questions:

1. Is there an actual business behind the stock?
2. How much of the information provided is verifiable?

I think AMFE is going to be traded in the dollars sooner rather than later, but that is just my opinion. Snakes&amp;Lattes is about to open its 4th location (and 1st in the USA) very soon, they also have 4 LOIs (letters of intent) for locations in Texas, Charlotte And 2 in Colorado I believe. They are currently projected to have 10 locations open in 2019, and now that the audits have been completed it is finally possible to aggressively pursue franchising. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg. That company has TONS of DD and is basically unknown. 

Once they up list to the QB, they will spin off IK and give their shareholders a one time dividend in shares of the new company based on their holdings to date.  

If I were you, I would check that out. 

Good luck",2018-09-25
