(OTCQB: KUTG), (the “Company” or “KULR”), today announced that it will provide specific-use thermal management material to [**Leidos**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=geopCbe9ulj8LDdCZawN7v-N2frkdIHxDhcPWeDFXKWhKbrqivqxQuMs42GrycTq2Whq5YkLiKijSnDZXumqJA==) (NYSE: LDOS) for ongoing testing, research and development on defense-related projects.  


Details of the agreement, the specific materials, and proposed projects are under security restrictions and will not be released but company leaders highlighted the importance of the relationship to continued programs within Leidos and with other partners.

“Whether in space, aerospace, defense or in consumer electronics, managing the heat of high-performance, high-demand components is always mission critical – too much heat, or not enough of it, in the wrong place at the wrong time can impair system performance or in the worst case be catastrophic,” said Dr. Timothy Knowles, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at KULR. “We are proud to continue our work on safe and efficient thermal solutions with industry and research leaders such as Leidos.”

“The design and development of next-generation products and systems requires next-generation energy management or thermal management solutions,” said Vice President Billy Schaefer, Leidos Business Manager for Directed Energy. “Partnering with KULR will help us create these innovative products from conception to implementation for the customer.”  


Though it’s not the company’s only thermal product, KULR’s core technology is a space-used, vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible, and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. As pure carbon, KULR fiber is perfectly heat efficient and because it behaves like a flexible fabric it can fit with just about any power or electronic configuration in extremely demanding spaces with minimal contact pressure. Partners, including NASA and multiple defense agencies and contractors, have contributed decades of research and development on KULR’s thermal technology solutions.

“New areas of defense technology like directed energy systems, for example, require upgraded, optimal thermal systems, even just to test them,” said Michael G. Carpenter, Vice-President of Engineering at KULR Technology. “That’s why agreements with companies such as Leidos are so exciting for us.” Directed energy research programs are similar to those being promoted by the [**Directed Energy Professional Society**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ws7DxmDVMLKFLFJDJIMQI7Al-BQT7aPNxnPzYTmvkd_w9vl0wv7Pi8yPzazdqwpAA-u3BbBHsE2PH9FrmARRDCoxVgqZAnBSWlzz-ZV95_CTuCVPfBsLLZZswswkWD1J).

KULR Technology Group, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary KULR Technology Corporation (""KULR""), develops and commercializes high-performance, space-used thermal management technologies for electronics, batteries and other components across an array of applications such as electrical vehicle, autonomous driving, AI/Cloud computing, energy storage and 5G communications technologies known collectively as e-Mobility.

SUNRISE, Fla., Oct. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profile Solutions, Inc. (OTC Pink: PSIQ) is pleased to announce it has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register securities under the Securities Act of 1933 as the first step to becoming an SEC reporting company and uplisting to OTCQB.    


Included in the S-1 Registration statement are PSIQ’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as well as the reviewed financial statement for the period ending June 30th, 2018. PSIQ intends to furnish its stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year, whether or not it is required to file such reports pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1390329/000157570518000211/psiq\_s1.htm](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=r4M7eqrNTeGCdPiYF91JptH3a9ikUGCHacN-JycRPT9sOpVPdn_ZD1q-rlIcZ12dyyvSpDEy2nMrYTtaPs0UjrblyNGdvo5mVtElcEtNAsrH3OT7LJTCm9t76WUvsiGe4IjlYx9sgx_tT_fQdJO8XUx_eS3o1XJODlK2pns__pCuGEjRts0EG48e7po9aHS5vCm-PWEnVD-x5C__3tJsa5fzp82awSx7xdW3FS7JDLcloRjldP-E99pmcz5a7pTp). In addition, PSIQ may from time to time furnish to stockholders’ additional information about PSIQ and its business as its management deems appropriate.

The Company’s voluntary filing of Form S-1 is the first step to becoming subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act) which includes annual, quarterly and current report filings. Subsequent thereto, PSIQ management intends to move forward with an application to OTC Markets to uplist to the OTCQB market tier.

Dan Oran, CEO of PSIQ stated, “The filing of Form S-1 is the next logical step of our plan to become a transparent fully reporting SEC Issuer filing timely reports with the SEC. We strongly believe in our business plan and expect to deliver positive results for our shareholders in the foreseeable future”.

20,Three Small Caps on this Fund Managers list [CO2 GRO],9t9bqh,I_Zeig_I,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9t9bqh/three_small_caps_on_this_fund_managers_list_co2/,1,0,"[Link to the article](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2018/10/30/three-small-caps-on-this-fund-managers-list.html)

&gt; *SP:* We started talking about cannabis, and there's one company that we own that has applications in the cannabis space, but it's not dependent on it, a company called CO2 Grow Inc. (GROW:TSX.V; BLONF:OTCQB). It has a CO2 foliar spray. It basically infuses water with carbon dioxide, which plants need to grow, and sprays it on the plant leaves. It has done some trials including in cannabis, and they have shown to increase the bud value on cannabis plants by 60–75%.

&gt; So it's significant for the cannabis players; it's a play on the space. And CO2 Gro is talking about it because it gets people's ears. But there is an even bigger market for vegetables like lettuce. Anything that has a lot of leafy mass particularly would benefit from this technology.

&gt; *SW:* Does it have to be used inside a warehouse or greenhouse? Could it be put on plants in an open field?

&gt; *SP:* Greenhouses often do infuse carbon dioxide into the air, but they can only do it so much because if people have to be in that environment, it's a hazard if the air is too concentrated with carbon dioxide. So there's a limit. CO2 Gro's technology can put way more CO2 between the water molecules and apply them directly on the plant leaf, and it doesn't pose a risk for people. So growers can use it in a greenhouse and improve what they already have. You can't concentrate air outside, so there's no CO2 supplementation happening in any outside growing, but there can be with this technology. For example, in California farmers could potentially add another crop cycle for things like lettuce, which would be huge.

&gt; CO2 Gro is at a similar stage as Avivagen, where it's validated the technology in trials and now it's at the early stages of getting contracts and revenue. It has guided to first revenue this quarter.
