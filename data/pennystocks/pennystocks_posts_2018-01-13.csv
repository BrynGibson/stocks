1,BVTK. A note from the CEO,7q2nl4,5MonkeyPunches,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7q2nl4/bvtk_a_note_from_the_ceo/,21,13,"The following was just posted by Tom.

""For the Record...: I've learned here in ""OTC Land"" that it doesn't matter if you provide good news--as folks will try to bash our stock and ""stir the pot"". BTW--we have reported them to FINRA. Because we have to prepare all weekend for next week's activities, let's take this time to get the record straight:

1. Fake News: You have been refused a patent for Ecrypt One. Non-sense. The patent process is a ""back-and-forth"" with a patent examiner. Our Harvard-trained patent attorneys just sent a doc today to the examiner in support of our claims.
2. Fake News: You have no equity investors. Non-sense. I think the technical phrase is we have a ""shit-load of them"" at our doorstep everyday of the week. We will make a well thought-out decision.
3. Fake News: All the note-holders will dump all their shares immediately. The fact is we have an excellent rapport with them and they want to become equity investors.

Despite the above--we will receive a gizzilion questions/comments/etc. this weekend...We have to work on the next set of JVs and acquisitions and don't plan on dealing with the fake news...Have a great holiday weekend! Do something good in memory of Dr. King...""

4,Carbon fiber revolution coming soon?,7q67us,Wisdom_from_the_Ages,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7q67us/carbon_fiber_revolution_coming_soon/,5,9,"From [this article](https://www.popsci.com/carbon-fiber-from-plants#page-3): 

*Researchers are now working with several firms to produce a large quantity of acrylonitrile that will be turned into carbon fiber and tested for use in automobiles. By making carbon fiber cheaper, scientists could help car owners save money in the long run. Cars made with carbon fiber are lighter than those made with steel. As a result, they need less fuel to cover the same distance, helping drivers save on gas while also cutting planet-warming carbon pollution.*",2018-01-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7q67us/carbon_fiber_revolution_coming_soon/

6,A heads up for the bottom scrapers: LEAS is active again,7q5w30,nbd9000,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7q5w30/a_heads_up_for_the_bottom_scrapers_leas_is_active/,3,6,"After bagholding on these guys for like 3 years, they just announced yesterday their intention to get current and someone bought up a sizable portion of the stock. It isnt really moving yet, but after being at the bottom for so long, any kind of activity is going to drive these guys up. I cancelled my sell order to see what happens..

DD from when they actually had a website that worked: LEAS originally leased mining equipment to large stripmines along with some farming equipment. they tanked after venturing out on a limb that broke, leaving them insolvent. currently trading at 0.0003$ a share.
