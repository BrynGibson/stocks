115,BaronCapdeville,dtfhzjx,/r/pennystocks/comments/7t4pka/best_trading_appwebsite/dtfhzjx/,1,"I second the bid for Fidelity. 

If you are starting over 10k, and want to day trade once you hit 25k use Interactive Brokers, if not, use Fidelity. 

TD is great, and their “Thinkorswim” software is wonderful, but the additional commission doesn’t net you much compared to Fidelity. Also, Fidelity has outperformed in the realm of execution (anecdotal). I routinely get better trades out of Fidelity, and my Customer service experience has been quick and US based, even after the markets close. 

Just call Fidelity, and ask for a free year of ATP, their level 2 trading software. 

Use the fuck out of ATP, and start reading books and articles on trading. After the first year, you should have no problem meeting the 36 annual trades. 3 trades a month? Easy. Even if you don’t make the trade quota, you can pay sub $200 for another year. The platform is great, and super customizable. I have over 20 custom templates set up for various purposes. 

I’ve familiarized myself with the basics, and am now moving on to options. 

Once my portfolio hits 10k-15k,I will likely take everything but my Roth’s to Interactive Brokers. Better business model, and I plan to day trade once I hit 25k-35k. 

Final note: it’s nothing too special, but Fidelity’s basic 2% visa card is easy to obtain, and has an option of dumping your 2% directly into your investment account. I recommend this. The 2% accrues on literally anything you use the card for, effectively netting you a 2% discount on... well, everything, assuming you never carry a balance, like a good boy/girl. 

Yes there are better cards, yes credit cards are frowned upon by many subs, and for good reason, but this one is better than just ok, and you can easily manage it from Fidelity’s app, which runs smooth, is relatively secure (historically speaking) and 2% on everything adds up faster than you think. 

I tossed my debit card in a drawer and had my bank freeze it (regions bank let’s you lock your debit card within their app). We use the one credit card for everything from Netflix subscriptions, to the power bill, to gas and groceries. It keeps a layer of insulation between you and would be thieves. 

Also, don’t carry a balance. Oh, and if I forgot to mention it above... don’t carry a balance. 

Alright, Fidelity mode off. Resume your day. Haha. ",2018-01-26
