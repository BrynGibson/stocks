0,Trump to re-open businesses...,fnx88s,Nice-Location,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fnx88s/trump_to_reopen_businesses/,1,9,"Trump said today on his Coronavirus press meeting that he will allow businesses to re-open in a few weeks. Instead of trying to get a stimulus relief package to help the economy get back on its feet. 

He's going to allow businesses to re-open 😒 With no plan to stop the spread of the Coronavirus...

Is this going to make companies like AYTU, DECN, TOMDF, OPK, Roche, etc etc more profitable in the long run? Since their the ones making test kits.

3,My DD on $AGRX,fnwpgr,ryan_opie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fnwpgr/my_dd_on_agrx/,1,0," 

Agile Therapeutics ($AGRX) is a pharmaceutical company and has one contraceptive product: Twirla. It was FDA approved in mid February 2020. Unfortunately, stock price has gone down due to stock dilutions and the CV outbreak, along with the fact that the FDA approval was baked into the stock price.

On StockTwits, user super\_marioo wrote:

*"" okay since I heard someone mention BO i'll share my thoughts again. i know posters on other beaten down stocks scream &amp; hope for BO out of desperation but a few minutes of research and you notice - insider selling or product was PIII approved but still needs years and $ to submit NDA &amp; receive FDA approval. AGRX is diff and is a prime buy-out target! min of $8 in March or April is my guess.*

*1. Agile has expertise in developing products - not sales &amp; marketing*

*2. FDA approved product with big market share potential*

*3. Big pharma already have sales &amp; marketing teams, doctor connections, etc and can launch Twirla much sooner*

*4. Cheaper for big pharma to buy an FDA approved product instead of developing one that may take 5-10 years*

*5. CFO recently hired has sold last 3 prior companies*

*6. CEO also has a history of selling companies*

*7. Insider buying - quite a bit last 6 weeks*

*8. Big cash position for negotiation leverage. the timing of the cash raise suspect &amp; had a BO taste ""*

and also wrote:

*"" a bad market is good timing for an acquisition. you are a penny flipper &amp; can't see beyond tomorrow. ofcourse they can sell the product - it's free with affordable care act and the CHC market is growing YOY. big pharma's growth strategy is m&amp;a's not holding onto cash!""*

Analyst forecasts range from $6 - $15. It's currently hovering around $1.60. As long as you hold tight onto this stock, you should eventually make a profit if a BO happens :))
