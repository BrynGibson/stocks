3,Iwasthechosenone,dtyytwt,/r/pennystocks/comments/7wb012/is_there_any_reason_not_to_share_the_size_and/dtyytwt/,1,"No, not really.  Not unless you have a massive amount of shares or tell him your stop loss.  He may be probing for entry and exit points to get a feel for things or to create averages.  

Stop losses are public and computer systems will find investors with large shares or a group of a lot of investors at a round number, they will then run the stock down to where a lot of people have a stop loss and trigger it.  They then will buy up all the shares sky rocketing the stock and throwing small and uneducated investors out of the stock and literally take their money.   

So I wouldn't tell him stop losses, and I wouldn't tell him if you have a massive amount of shares.  Many professional traders include what stock they are buying and how many shares.  By itself it's not harmful in any way to give, but also, you don't owe him anything and there is no reason to really tell him. ",2018-02-09

This is a penny stock and they'll get to ya if you aren't prepared. I missed out on the great DCTH run when I saw it coming because I but my faith in the stock CVM and was already uneasy cause I lost some cash then. 
Plan your course and keep researching 

I tried pulling up the chart and nothing came for me so will post when I can find more info. 

But from what it seems, that's a really weird price point for an investor to put in when the shares are .59 at time of writing. So my prediction is reverse split and or they wrote their own little thing.

After the jump I was looking around to see if it’d be a good investment with possibilities to jump further and that’s when I found StockTwits.  When I found Aker on StockTwits it had only roughly 900 watchers and it had the same 3 “regulars” who posted every day about how “Aker is going to the moon!”.   Now it’s at 15,000 watchers on StockTwits and the community has dozens of “regulars” who post everyday.

I have to say that StockTwits has helped me temper that a lot....and AKER has helped me hone my patience, too.
