It’s a trading platform u can use on your phone and they don’t charge fees for trades. Most other platforms charge $5-$10 a trade. 

You can start small and sink away $50-$100 a week or so until your portfolio grows without paying pesky fees. 



The thing with penny stocks is it’s a huge gamble. Some pop, most don’t. Additionally, you really have to do solid research on a company. 

I know you don’t want to hear this, it’s not as fun. But sinking your money into ETFs or a solid stock such as Visa or Nike right now is a good way to start.

Get a few stocks like those destined for slow bust steady growth, and once you have anywhere from 1K to 10K in those fuck around with penny stocks

If you want to roll the dice, I’d sink like 5%-20% of your portfolio on penny stocks when you get a solid base built. 

Sorry to ramble on , good luck trading! Keep at it!

OTLK is a good penny stock to look at.",2020-01-20
