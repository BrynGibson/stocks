0,Look at $PCTL on 2 day chart please. Giant Spike and Dip. Opinions?,cg98z9,GreenStonks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cg98z9/look_at_pctl_on_2_day_chart_please_giant_spike/,7,2,"On Friday it went from .0025 to a high of .019 and closed at .0092.

It had 133M in volume, and it looks like the spike happened when the stock was overbought on RSI. 

&gt; Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corp (PCT) is a technology licensing  company specializing in environmentally safe solutions for global  sustainability. The company provides innovative products and  technologies for eliminating contamination from water supplies,  industrial fluids, hard surfaces, food processing equipment and medical  devices. 

I have no idea what caused the stock to spike and pop the way it did. It must be a P&amp;D.

22,The Nano-Stock-Company Application,cgej8u,KKBHH,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cgej8u/the_nanostockcompany_application/,1,1,"An application developer has developed a corporate structure that is a nano-stock-company.

A nano-stock-company is a state-registered C-corporation that issues shares of stock under SEC rule 504. Stock issued under Rule 504 has less regulation to meet and the company has less regulation to meet. Rule 504 allows up to $5 million in funding per year unless limited by state laws.

The nano-stock-company has some core purpose that is historically true. However, the funding raised will likely go into a non-core wealth portfolio that assures the future of the company. Then the nano-stock-company positions the wealth as 60% Treasury securities and as 40% other regulated securities and that avoids investment-company definition and regulation.

Since the nano-stock-company is a C-corporation then there are no dividends paid to the shareholders because dividends would be double-taxed. So the nano-stock-company is interested in growing in value and has a liquid-net-asset-value. Now a C-corporation does face only the new lower corporation tax rates. Also a C-corporation does not face any limits on number of shareholders.

Next, since the nano-stock-company does not pay a dividend then the shareholders are allowed, after a one-year regulatory wait requirement, to post their holding on a company internet bulletin board if they want to sell their position. The stock is posted on the internet bulletin board using a cryptographic hash as a public Serial Key, public Registration Key, number of shares, e-mail, and other notes. Then the shareholder holds the private ID Key. The private ID Key proves ownership by combining with the public Serial Key to output the correct public Registration Key. Of course a standard software is available and used and standardized procedures are used to update a position on the internet bulletin board.

KBH Editorial Corporation is the first nano-stock-company. Google doesn't always give the most up-to-date link so consider www dot kbhscape dot com slash kbhia dot htm .
