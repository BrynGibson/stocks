12,$AITX Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions DD,av7kmr,ckeith7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/av7kmr/aitx_artificial_intelligence_technology_solutions/,1,6,"Hey everyone, wanted to bring this stock to your attention. Here’s some history and links. 

AITX started out as a security robot provider called RAD (Robotic Assistances Devices) where they created the software for a robot producer. In time it was shown that the robot was ineffective which caused the company a good amount of debt but thankfully they pivoted into a self made solution called SCOT. 

[SCOT](https://roboticassistancedevices.com/scot/) is a robotic security tower that can replace security guards and provide better protection for a fraction of the cost. Currently operating in 11 states with each deployment being atleast 2 SCOT Towers. 

They also created the Wally which is a wall mounted SCOT that has gained traction in different verticals. The [Use Case](https://roboticassistancedevices.com/use-cases/) page is also extremely impressive listing out multiple situations where SCOT has assisted Costco (who’s listed by name)

Beyond this they’ve also been in discussion with Fortune 50s, 100s, and 500s. Their ceo Steve Reinharz is worth following on Twitter as he’s extremely communicative with shareholders. 

After pivoting last year it looks like the company is gaining some real traction working with federal transportation clients and large enterprises currents yet the market cap is still only 1mil. 

Compared to their biggest competitor knightscope (who spends way more, makes less, and has untraceable shares) who’s current valuation is 250mil, RADs valuation seems incredibly low especially with the main goals being to uplist to OTCQB, get cash flow positive, and release an outdoor robot in April/May. 

Not to mention that they also partner closely with Allied Universal which is the largest security provider in the USA. 

Myself and others were burnt on this one before but at its current valuation with its future potential it’s an absolute no brainer. The chart also looks primed and ready to go. If the company releases any news about re-negotiating debt or more contracts this thing has the potential to skyrocket.
