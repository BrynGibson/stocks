Highly recommend NOT signing up to newsletters as most of them are pump and dump scams. In this time of the economy there is blood in the streets, and that is the best time to invest. With 5k you dollar cost average. Learn it, and use it. You can make money breaking even on a stock. Don’t get emotionally attached to stocks. Set up your entry points and exits before buying a stock, and execute that plan. Do not deviate unless you are in the green. Don’t be greedy. Make sure the penny stocks you are trading have decent volume action, otherwise it will be hard for you to sell.

I’ve made well over 1000%. As I understand it there’s some big money behind the reverse takeover of NHPI and some serious investors involved. Yahoo finance has the target price @ 2$ and I could honestly see it going higher, the chart has only been getting stronger and I’m still kicking myself for all the times I thought about adding to my initial investment. That being said it does have a long way to go before it hits $2 so anybodies guess is as good or better than mine. At the current .019 i think it’s a steal and there’s absolutely still some money to be made.
