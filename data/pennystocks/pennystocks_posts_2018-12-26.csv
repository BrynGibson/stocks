How does everyone not invest in these companies?

Parcelpal is like uber.  Get paid to deliver parcels. If you buy stock and you work for them you literally double down. It's like making money twice over.

Mcoa and ghg work with HempSmart.

You know isagenix, prime America, doTERRA? 

It's the same thing but with hemp.

Why not buy stock and work for them at the same time? If you get one person to sign up under you and they're dedicated, you're making a lot of money. 

Even if you don't want to work, you know other people will. it's literally like having a small army under you.
