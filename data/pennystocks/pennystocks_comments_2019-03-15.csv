First, you can only buy shares that are willing to be traded on trading platforms like E-Trade and Robinhood. I don't know how many are available but it's probably much less than 51% of any company.

Second, companies are worth a lot of money, millions of dollars, so even if the penny stock is worth 0.005 dollars you'll still need tens to hundreds of millions of shares to get close to buying it.

Third, even if a company has listed 80%+ of their stock on the open market there are still TONS of stocks that are owned by many other people so you'd have to get a large chunk of those too if you wanted 51% of one company.

No. With only $100 you shouldn't be looking to ""invest"". You should be trying to build an emergency savings. You certainly shouldn't be looking at pennystocks, which are essentially gambling. Check out /r/personalfinance before coming back here, IMO.

To your second question, yes, penny stocks are just stocks. You can buy them off any broker. The only issue is that some penny stocks aren't listed on NASDAQ so some places like Robinhood won't sell them. But you'll get eaten up by fees trading penny stocks on some brokers.
