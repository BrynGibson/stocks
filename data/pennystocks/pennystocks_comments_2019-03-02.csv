NDM is an exploration company, not a mining company. This means the catalysts you seek are JV and ultimately BO. It’s currently in an expeditor day NEPA process and just had a very positive DEIS. Less than a year to FEIS and a year and some change till RoD. 


If FQM valued this at 1.5 billion for 50% with all the previous risk; I.E no DEIS, Walker in office, BM1 on the ballot, etc. than it’s worth far more than that. 8-18.50 in a buyout IMO. 


If you don’t mind waiting. M&amp;A is heating up in the space and this is a world class asset. HMU if you want to chat about it further, I’ve research this everyday since 2017 and have used the past year to average down from 2.10 to 1.01 average.

I’ve come to find a great understanding of patience while learning this sector thanks to NDM. The copper space is about to get pretty wild thanks to a deficit with minimal replacements down the pipeline. This crossing over with clean energy and EVs.

It is worth noting that until they get a JV partner (which I believe will happen March/April), NDM does not currently have enough finances to complete the permitting process. Dilution to finish permitting on their own is still a possibility however it would only be a short term hit. They’ve considered investment firm offers and have a base shelf just in case (see those podcasts) which is not a bad way to get through IMO. I have never seen a management team that I am this confident in ever. 

I believe they are still susceptible to lawsuits from enviros after RoD, but NEPA is the gold standard and they would prevail. IMO a full buyout would happen prior to the RoD (mid 2020) and said major or consortium would win the case easily with a Positive FEIS.
