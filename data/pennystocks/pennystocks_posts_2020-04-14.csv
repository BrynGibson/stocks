I'm a founder of stockval ([https://stockval.co](https://stockval.co/)).

Stockval is a lightweight realtime stock market price tracker with *anonymous* portfolios and alerts. It's loginless. No personal data. Still, your portfolios and alerts stay on our server and are accessible via a unique URL.

So why stockval? There are hunderds of portfolio trackers out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a simple one that would be fast enough, have realtime prices and worked well on all devices. All I found seemed to be extremely bloated.

I've been tweaking stocvkal for over a year. Today, I finally decided to share this lightweight app with you, guys.

Please make sure you try all features, bookmark a customised URL (e.g. [https://stockval.co/10fb/usd](https://stockval.co/10fb/usd) or [https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd](https://stockval.co/aapl/1000usd)), create a portfolio, save some alerts, and then share the app with your friends if you like it.

All the feedback is appreciated! Thanks!

P.S. VIDEO that shows all the features: [https://youtu.be/bLBIs9OLfxk](https://youtu.be/bLBIs9OLfxk)
