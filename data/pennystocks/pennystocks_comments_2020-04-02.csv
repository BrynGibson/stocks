They already have supply chains and logistics figured out. They just took out a $13 million dollar loan non-dilutive for production.

11,DuhYes,fm6jq5v,/r/pennystocks/comments/ftdzv6/decn/fm6jq5v/,2,"I think its a pump and dump the 13 million dollar interest free loan they got was false or very intentionally vague. Why didnt they post credit agreements on the OTC market as supplemental information?

As of March 23, only $500,000 of the announced subscriptions had been funded. Plus, $10,000,000 of the $13,000,000 was announced as a line of credit, not a loan. And the $10,000,000 is to be used to finance inventory, thus DECN cannot even touch the line of credit until DECN begins producing COVID-19 test kits in ""LATE SUMMER 2020""! There is good chance funding of the announced credit instruments is conditioned on DECN getting FDA approval to sell kits in the U.S. and/or a CE Mark to sell kits in Europe.",2020-04-02

16,gism1984,fm6lk6y,/r/pennystocks/comments/ftdzv6/decn/fm6lk6y/,1,"DECN has a history of boasting they will over perform and consistently don‚Äôt meet the expectations they set so be cautious with what you see them put out there. This happened with their diabetes strips and will without a doubt happen with the Covid-19 tests. All their PR reports have been vague to purposefully pump stock price and not amounted to any to much. Seems like a lot of investors don‚Äôt think highly of Bozo the CEO and he has done some shady things in the past. Read up on Investors Hub for more. I‚Äôd be surprised if they manage to sell a million kits.

I feel by the time they get approval for their tests the market will have already decided who the go to players will be for these rapid tests. Since DECN is relying on a different approach, the diabetes meter, they will have a hard time swaying people from the other tests that have been tried and true for a few months already by the time DECN hits market. Abbott is gaining a lot of traction but there are hundreds of other that will be producing FDA approved tests and not to mention the 100s of producers in China that are not FDA approved and selling to third world countries with less strict guidelines.

If you do decide to get in I would suggest waiting a few days and watching the stock, it will be going much lower than it currently is and I don‚Äôt see it rising for a few weeks as according to the report they are 8 weeks out from being market ready. There is the possibility for gains with FDA approval which is probably a minimum a week away. Other than that smells of pump and dump. Notice how everyone that says they are a good play will be vague just like con man Bozo Berman.",2020-04-02

Virus was fresh news and fear was strong...

Then nothing but fluff. Stock up and down, never really ran over 2 bucks again.

2 direct offerings which can raise price if people think that's a good sign, or lower price of that think it's just more shares out there...

Now tests finally selling. But bit too little too late for capitalizing on hype. 500k tests still 2 weeks out.

Price died back in 18 and hasn't seemed to ever make any real run at coming back.

I gambled 5000 shares and didn't jump when it broke $2, so still watching at small profit. I'd love to see it rocket off, but unless the 100k tests get some more press I'll probably sell then buy maybe 2000 on a low limit and hope the 500k tests makes a bigger impact.

I've researched a fair amount, but it doesn't feel like price is moving on solid company and sales, but just hype.  I could be totally wrong, just how it feels to me",2020-04-02

Check out all the random stock accounts on Twitter pumping DECN. Check out the DECN message boards on investorshub.

The post history on Reddit all time for DECN is also very telling, you can spot the names early.",2020-04-02
