1)  I will give you between 24-48 hours notice before a sub $0.02 stock hits between $0.03-$0.07 in one day and;

2)  I will give you between 24-48 hours notice before a $0.00004 stock makes let's call it a VERY substantial move.

If I am wrong on either, please feel free to call me at 844-565-5665 for a full refund of your funds invested.  Not a joke.  In exchange, I ask that you play even closer attention to my next ""investment idea"".",2018-08-17

111,ChartsNDarts,e4es3bb,/r/pennystocks/comments/97yiin/psa_please_do_not_buy_hmny_there_will_soon_be/e4es3bb/,1,"Let‚Äôs assume in order to ‚Äúretire‚Äù, as you said, you will need $1,000,000. So if you took the $30 that was mentioned above you could essentially buy 1,000 shares of HMNY in the open market right now for ~$0.03 per share. 

In order for you to ‚Äúretire‚Äù you would need the stock price to reach $1,000 per share (1,000 shares x $1,000/per share = $1,000,000).

Since HMNY keeps selling more shares into the market, their shares outstanding in the open market is nearing 1 billion.

So the stock price went to $1,000 per share, the market cap of the company would be nearly $1 trillion (1 billion shares outstanding x $1,000 per share = $1 trillion).

That would mean it was worth more the Google, Netflix, and Amazon. 

TL;DR There is a 0% that MoviePass breaks above $1 ever again.
