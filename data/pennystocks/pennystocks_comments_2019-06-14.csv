Courtesy of Bloomberg : The license permits Stem Holdings, Inc. to cultivate cannabis locally for research and development, prior to the issuance of new licenses under the newly established Medical Cannabis Authority. Under the order, Stem Holdings, Inc. will construct a modern research facility which will house the cultivation of a variety of high cannabidiol (CBD) and low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cultivars. SVG and Stem will utilize a variety of agronomic methodologies, including traditional outdoor, greenhouse, and indoor cannabis, to analyze which approach would be most productive for the Caribbean country. The partnership between Stem and SVG is expected to position St. Vincent and the Grenadines to tap into the global industry generating an estimated US$1 billion in earnings. In December of 2018 SVG passed a bill in Parliament to decriminalize cannabis for medical and scientific research purposes. The research license awarded to Stem permits unlimited cultivation of both CBD Hemp and cannabis in the Caribbean country. Stem‚Äôs facilities in SVG are projected to be operational by the first calendar quarter of 2020 and all the raw material produced will be processed, packaged, and distributed under Stem‚Äôs widely recognized brands.",2019-06-14

Especially one that's at fifty cents?  

If I wanted to take a huge gamble and blow my money I'd find a semi-clean shell that is currently in trips and hope that sometime in the next few years someone tries to pump and dump it with some bullshit RM that will never really happen.",2019-06-14

84,tmh0312,eria2da,/r/pennystocks/comments/c0gogc/simple_questions_june_14_2019/eria2da/,1,"No account limit I believe. Account should be free to set up even if you only have $100 in it and they don't charge you to maintain it. They have a broker fee of $4.95 per trade. They also have fees on option contracts. 

All that being said, they have pretty much every stock you could ever want on there. If you list the stock symbol you're looking for I could check for you before you go through the hassle of setting up the account.

Or you could email support on their website and ask them. They're always very helpful.",2019-06-14

I did pretty good with GFI and sold at 5.10 after getting in the low 4.00s but that was because i found myself on a broker's email list and just picked one of the companies after reading through their reports.  

I'm just starting out but i'm wondering if i should be paying more attention to p/s or p/e ratios; total debt; or debt to equity? recent news articles? any bit of help would be appreciated. thanks",2019-06-14
