No thanks. Your post history shows all you try to do is pump up the penny stocks you own. Most of which haven’t done anything.

Also, nice try but your $10,000 bid happened a month ago too apparently.

90,chud6,fgsz30m,/r/pennystocks/comments/ezzn31/still_cant_believe_acb_is_the_most_popular/fgsz30m/,1,"&gt;TLDR: ACB has some fantastic indicators of turn around. Just not for day traders.

I agree, based on what I read this morning.  

They are cutting jobs, which is good for share price. 

Old management made promises about strategy that they didn't keep, so I say good riddance; bring on new management. 

The company had their hands in a lot of different projects, but now are talking about focusing on the core projects that make the most money. 

They have already taken steps this quarter to reduce their debt. 

TL;DR - it will take a while to rebound, but I believe ACB *will* rebound.",2020-02-06
