104,PlatypusOfWallStreet,dukxl5n,/r/pennystocks/comments/7yy1mh/where_did_you_start_where_do_you_get_information/dukxl5n/,1,"I aim for medium with my purchases (I would buy options with an expiry date 4-6 months from now in case there is any kind of correction or month long dip that could damage me) but am perfectly willing to sell if a stock pops up even the next day. So buying medium term with the hopes for short term sell returns. But nothing wrong with just going long (it has a term in the options world, this strategy is called leaps). Going long on a stock that you already go long on with an option instead is a sure way to make that much more. My buddy who does this full time, made 1600% from a 1 year hold of one option stock.

My strategy is to stay liquid as much as possible and use dips as opportunities to buy and sell and get back to the state of liquidity. Its actually working out phenomenally, while everybody on Reddit panics about losing their money, I always have money readily available to take advantages of the market going down.

As for earnings, most good stocks have a run up 3-6 weeks in advance to their earnings so you can even just ride the run ups and get decent money. Find a real winner in the stock world (i.e. amazon) go to earningswhisper.com, punch in their name, get the next earnings date.... and a month or so before earnings buy a call option with a slightly higher strike price than current. You are almost always going to make something as long as... as I said there's no month long dips. Which again if you think buying medium term (which I think you should given how volatile everything has been) is okay because you got those extra months before your options expire.

Just so you know, with options you are betting that by date *X* company stock price will be *Y*. If by or before that date the price hits it, you make a lot of money(more if it continues to rise). However If it does not and it goes in the other direction, you lose alot of money too. As good as my returns have been, I have seen my option from one stock being worth $2,000 when I bought it  to now being like $20 too... lol, So unless you can stomach that kind of loses with the same kinds of gains... You will be fine, just warning about making dumb plays with options is no joke.",2018-02-20
