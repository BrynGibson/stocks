86,matthew-jumper,fdho9zk,/r/pennystocks/comments/ecwo6g/chk_chesapeake_energy/fdho9zk/,1,"This stock has been in a downward channel since late-August/early-September.  It's been doing nothing but lower highs and lower lows.  They have until the end of May to have been over $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days or they get delisted.  Honestly, this company is headed for bankruptcy.  The debt restructuring sounds nice until you look at the terms.  Sure, they sold some debt for $.60 on the dollar, but the interest rate almost doubled, effectively nullifying any gain from restructuring, not counting time until they default.  So, yeah, they pushed off defaulting, but it doesn't mean they'll even be able to full repay the new senior promissory notes.

In the end, this thing is headed down the drain for a few months until they reverse split to stay listed.  My advice: short the brakes off this stock until a reverse split is announced.  After it occurs, jump back in and short it again.  I'm doing it and you can bet many others are as well.

Final note: CHK is sitting on $9.5B in debt with a market cap of $1.76B; unfortunately, I don't see them digging out of that hole.
