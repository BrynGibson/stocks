SHMP doesn't make it real clear how indoor growing will up pass 90% survival.  With control of the bioflock, current systems seem to be working quite well. Bad bacteria and ammonia are the enemies of every system. This is where bioflock comes in. It is the good bacteria. It consumes the shrimp poo, which then is consumed by zoo plankton,  and then up the food chain until it is consumed by the shrimp. 

SHMP's hype about indoor farming anywhere. ..well that's already being done...and successfully. This shrimp farming has peaked my interest. I've got a couple of empty buildings that might work for growing.

If it‚Äôs 250 million and they get 10 million for their trouble all though that‚Äôs a boost it‚Äôs not anywhere close to 15$. If you said a run up to 2$ I‚Äôd be inclined to say it‚Äôs possible but 15$ is why everyone is looking at you crazy.

In trumps USA technology infringement has become a huge thing. In the case of google they have been infringing for a decade now.
