9,MauldotheLastCrafter,ecm4ciw,/r/pennystocks/comments/a9s1v7/people_seem_to_be_confused_about_the_fdas_stance/ecm4ciw/,1,"These people are wrong. The federal government has full jurisdiction over interstate commerce, and so if CBD is illegal at a federal level you cannot transport it from a legal state to another legal state. 

This is a link about mailing through the federal postal service, but it applies to any federal transport: https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/mailing-cannabis-through-usps

So no, big box retailers would not be able to transport CBD products, like /u/ThatPeskyRodent asked. They can transport them within state limits, just like states where marijuana is legal have to handle every aspect of marijuana cultivation within their territory, but they cannot ship CBD from, say, Arkansas to Oklahoma.

While the IRS will take the money, banks will not which makes selling weed products, of which cbd is, effectively a cash business. Which is not something you can do with companies like amazon. They do have a plan ready to roll out in the event that laws pass, but until then, don't hold your breath. 

Another big reason is that even though states can sell, but transporting a Schedule 1 narcotic across state lines is still federally illegal. CBD has been reclassified to a schedule 5. However, transporting any scheduled controlled substance across state lines is federally illegal. ",2018-12-26

It's like an old-school loophole. 

If you spend a billion dollars on the Cannabis industry, you will be the one the FBI busts.

If you're buying the joint to smoke in your own home, they're going to leave you alone.

You don't need to advertise cigarettes, because everyone knows they kill you. But if you like to smoke you still buy them. but if you advertise how cool they are outside of a school the cops will arrest you.
