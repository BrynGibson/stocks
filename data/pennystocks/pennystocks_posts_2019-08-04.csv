1,"$LPTX - upcoming event, ER, and encouraging data to date...",clrovj,WonLinerz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/clrovj/lptx_upcoming_event_er_and_encouraging_data_to/,3,8,"Encouraging data to date, with an upcoming presentation to review results on 8/6 [to provide an update on their DKN-01 program and trials](https://investors.leaptx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/leap-therapeutics-host-conference-call-provide-dkn-01-program).

Little pullback this week due to S-1 but, rebounded same day. Applications in gastroesophageal cancer certain gynecological cancers, esophageal cancer, and hard to treat prostate cancers.  Clinical trials are underway for several of these. [Check out the pipeline here](https://www.leaptx.com/science)

They generally don‚Äôt push news for events *this* far in advance, and they will be presenting with 2 clinical investigators. Add to that an earnings report two days later, looks like they‚Äôre setting up to juice the two for combined momentum.

Interesting independently, but the big potential catalyst could be the use of the drug in combination with Keytruda, to treat esophagogastric cancer. Keytruda is owned by Merck, a company with deep enough pockets to see them as an acquisition candidate.

They have a 12 month PT of $9.00, but short term could jump significantly with the news. I‚Äôm long here, but think an acquisition could happen well before the year is up. Currently trading at $2.35 with a great setup heading into next week‚Äôs presentation. 

IMPORTANT NOTE. Biotech stock with binary event - sooo there‚Äôs *always* the possibility it gets trashed if data is bad. Nothing is a guarantee (but this seems to have positive indicators abound).",2019-08-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/clrovj/lptx_upcoming_event_er_and_encouraging_data_to/

Just seems silly and unnecessary, and I'm glad nobody really does it on this sub.
