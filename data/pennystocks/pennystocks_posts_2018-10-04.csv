I thought it had for a bit and bought at .049 when I thought it was evening out and literally 10 minutes later it dropped to .035 and then now it's at .023.

My intro to penny stocks the last couple weeks has just been 2 for 2 for losses (CEI &amp; HMNY) which is kind of entertaining to me because I expected to double my money coming into this side of investing but obviously this is based on a lot more DD and being ahead of the curve and of course a decent amount of luck than I expected instead of following the hype and buying as soon as people tell me to as I started out.

Thank god I only started with $150 instead of diving in with my bank account whew, definitely love trading so far so I'm going to keep at it and hopefully make some profit eventually!

21,MWX.V - Mineworx completes construction of their new proprietary three-stage E-Waste and mining concentration plant,9lcfog,kansaigaidai,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9lcfog/mwxv_mineworx_completes_construction_of_their_new/,1,0,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mineworx Technologies Ltd., (the ""Company"" or ""Mineworx"") (MWX.V) (MWXRF) (FSE: YRS WKN: A2DSW3), a leading provider of proprietary, cost-effective, and non-toxic precious metals extraction solutions to the E-Waste and mining industries is pleased to announce, along with its JV partner EnviroLeach Technologies, the completion of construction of the new proprietary three-stage concentration plant located in our new 13,600 square-foot facility in Vancouver, B.C. 

As outlined in EnviroLeach’s Corporate Update, over the last 2 weeks approximately 10 tonnes of printed circuit boards were successfully processed to test the performance of the installation.  The line ran at a sustained rate of 900 kg per hour and produced a very high-quality, pure metal concentrate which is saleable to one of our refining partners.  The company projects an initial production rate of 10 tonnes per day and plans to add an additional shift when appropriate, increasing production to the designed rate of 20 tonnes per day.

To accommodate the processing of larger scale E-Waste such as complete power supplies, computer servers, telecommunication components and cable/satellite set top boxes, an additional large 4 cubic meter pre-shredder is being added to the line.  The new pre-shredder is expected to be fully operational by October 15th.

The first load of 40 tonnes of printed circuit boards recently arrived and the Company has secured an additional 400 tonnes of low to mid-grade circuit boards, cable boxes, modems and PC/server power supplies which will be processed through October and November.

The new concentration plant allows for the economic extraction of all valuable metals from a significantly wider variety of E-Waste than was initially targeted.  The process is able to separate, extract and monetize 4 fractions.  The copper based precious metals concentrate will be sold to refiners while a ferrous metal and aluminum fraction will be sold to recyclers.  The final light substrate fraction which contains approximately 50% of the precious metals value will be processed with the EnviroLeach formula.

The post-leached substrate material, or tailings, will be repurposed for use in construction materials.  This new utilization of the tailings combined with the reduction of carbon emissions from smelting plus the EnviroLeach formula’s reusability will create the world’s only zero emission E-Waste recycling process.

The new “Dry Side” process, combined with the proprietary “Wet Side” leaching system, utilizing the eco-friendly patent-pending EnviroLeach formula, now delivers significant improvements in performance.  The combined process results in estimated metal recovery rates in the 90% to 95% range.

The intention is to produce and ship 20 tonnes of the light substrate fraction from the Vancouver plant to the Jabil Memphis facility in November for full-scale tank leaching. This is being done to prove the feasibility of the complete processing cycle which incorporates the Company’s new concentrate methods.

“Both the Mineworx and EnviroLeach teams are to be commended for their achievements in the design and construction of the concentration plant,” commented Greg Pendura, President and CEO.  The new modular plant was created in the new Vancouver facility in less than three months and the enhancements to the revised system cannot be overstated.”

27,EXMGF / MIN.TO - Excelsior Mining Company,9le0p8,Footsteps_10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9le0p8/exmgf_minto_excelsior_mining_company/,1,0,"I received this tip from a CPA on plane from Palm Springs. Company’s name is Excelsior Mining Company based out of Arizona, traded on the OTCQX.

They have developed a new mining strategy which involved water acidic treatment of copper reserves deep in the ground. The process is called “in-situ” is minimally invasive and involves water pumping and treatment to extract copper in the ground.

Excelsior was facing regulatory approval on their two sites in Arizona and just received both approvals from the EPA in late August.

They have tremendous bench strength with a former congressman and multiple PHDs and CPAs. 

It’s trading at .75 USD and they should report Q3 in November. I believe mining operations have begun and if you can sit on your investment for 12 months, I believe this has boom potential.

Copper is $2.81 / lb

28,It’s not about to be a penny stock anymore guys. DYODD!!,9lh87c,Azuwho,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9lh87c/its_not_about_to_be_a_penny_stock_anymore_guys/,1,1,"Ticker WTER This company just applied to list on the NASDAQ on October 1. The application process takes roughly about 6 to 8 weeks for it to be approved. The stock has A flow of 36 million shares LOL. Also the volume on the stock is only 150,000 a day. Take a look at the stockNBEV whom has a float of 46m is listed on Nasdaq and 60+ million shares exchanged. 

TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!

Only people who sell as market orders cause this to dip. Company is sound and under the radar. They diluted some shares yesterday to cause a dip. So hop the hell in &amp; buckle up. 

My first suggestion on Reddit... :) 

Also Namaste tech NXTTF is in a silent period and is being bashed down relentlessly by CITRON 
The silent period is over on 10/16/2018 but expect slow movement on this stock until around then. They hired the PWC auditors a week ago. Golden as their the 3rd biggest auditor globally. Also they plan on uplifting to Nasdaq! If you buy shares now set the price up high for sale so they can’t be shorted. It’ll cause it to rise sooner as it’s heavily being shorted now. From $3.10 to $1.50 fighting between $1.62 and $1.84 atm. I’m hoping it stays under $2 until the 15th :)

 ALEAF also applied  to uplist to the NASDAQ on 10/2
