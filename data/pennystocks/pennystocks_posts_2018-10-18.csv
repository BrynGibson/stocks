1,Are penny stocks a bad idea for beginners?,9p735n,girl_vs_world,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9p735n/are_penny_stocks_a_bad_idea_for_beginners/,1,14,I'm kind of busy right now studying for some medical licensing exam. So I don't have much time. I'm dedicating a few hours of my day to learn about stocks. I do not want to waste my time learning about something that is not going to help me make money. The reason I wanted to look into penny stocks is because I have a small capital (a little under $1k). But I heard some youtubers saying that penny stocks are too risky and not a good idea for beginners. ,2018-10-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9p735n/are_penny_stocks_a_bad_idea_for_beginners/

They dropped an 8k detailing a plan to merge with vidbox which is a redbox platform based in mexico and plans to spread to south america. I know your probably thinking redbox?

Redbox type kiosks would make an absolute killing down there. Former netflix guy is on the advisory board for vidbox as well. [https://vidboxmexico.com/homepage](https://vidboxmexico.com/homepage)
