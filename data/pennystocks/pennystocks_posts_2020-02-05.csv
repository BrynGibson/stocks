1,New stock app on android store is a virus?,ez68sh,dfssuperherp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ez68sh/new_stock_app_on_android_store_is_a_virus/,1,19,"I know this probably doesn't belong here but I figured someone must know on here. Has anyone tried this new stock trading app called tradeup? I got a referral from someone to get a free stock and after downloading my phone started acting super weird. They make you verify your phone number right, well about an hour afterwards I started getting some weird texts from people I don't. One of them was saying they were an old friend I haven't talked to in years, when I questioned how they got my number they said through my brother Jimmy and I don't have a brother Jimmy. It's not just the wrong number because they knew alot about me and where I lived. They kept asking questions trying to get information. It also kept randomly saving files in my folders on my phone in Chinese. And opening an closing by itself. I looked on app store under comments and it seems there are only 3, with one of them saying it's a app used for stealing information and spying. I wound up doing a factory reset on my phone and now they keep emailing me saying my deposits have been successful over and over and I haven't used the app since then I never even deposited. I even tried logging in again on the website thinking maybe they are somehow taking my money but I think I'm locked out or something nothing happens when I login.",2020-02-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ez68sh/new_stock_app_on_android_store_is_a_virus/

25,My Guide for Researching a Stock using Financial Ratios,ezhwmx,TheUnadvisedGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ezhwmx/my_guide_for_researching_a_stock_using_financial/,1,10,"I'm just now learning how to trade penny stocks. The number one thing I've learned so far is to do my research on a company to minimize risk. I've made a list of the financial ratios that i should look at and what some of them mean.

  

Liquidity Ratios\-Lower liquidity ratio is a good indication that a company is struggling to stay in business and grow

Quick Ratio-Indicates the company’s ability to instantly use its near-cash assets to pay down its current liabilities. A higher ratio means the company is having no trouble paying its current liabilities. Calculate: (Cash and equivalents + marketable securities + Accounts receivable) divided by Current liabilities. 

Operating Cash Flow Ratio- Tells you the number of times a company can pay off current debts with cash flow from operations(cash flow after expenses have been deducted) generated within the same period. Calculate: Divide operating cash flow by current liabilities.

Leverage Ratios\-Helps determine the company’s ability to handle long term debt

D/E Ratio-Indicates how a company derives its capital financing. Shouldn’t be above 2.0. A higher ratio indicates the company borrows more money than it owns, and that it is at a higher chance of defaulting on a loan. Expanding ratios should only occur if the company is trying to support future growth. Calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholder equity

Interest Coverage Ratio-Higher ratio indicates the company is good at managing their debt load. Measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payment with its available earnings. Calculated by dividing company earnings before interest and taxes(EBIT) by the company’s interest expenses for the same period.

Performance Ratios\-Help determine the sustainability of the company

Gross Profit Ratio- Gross profit is the business revenue after subtracting the cost of goods only. It is a good indicator in determining how much profits is generated from the company’s goods or services, which can help you determine if a company is going to be able to last another year on its current trajectory plan. Calculate: Gross profit margin is gross profit divided by net sales.

Net Profit Margin-Net profit is the business's revenue after subtracting all operating, interest, and tax expenses. The net profit margin illustrates how much of each dollar in revenue collected by a company translates to profit. Calculate: Subtract all expenses from revenue, the divide by revenue, then multiply by 100. 

I need to check both of these because the Net Profit Margin takes all expenses into account, including expenses that could help the company down the line, which would lower its ratio giving me a bad indicator.

Valuation Ratios\-Measures the appeal of the stock at its current price. Helps identify undervalued stocks

P/E Ratio-Relates a company’s share price to its earnings per share. It can show how overvalued(a high P/E) or undervalued(a low P/E) a stock is. It can also help determine how a stock’s valuation compares to its sector and benchmark like the S&amp;P 500. Basically, the P/E indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of the company’s earnings Calculate: Divide the current stock price by Earnings per share

Price/S Ratio-An indicator of the value placed on each dollar of a company’s sales. Shows how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of sales. A low ratio may indicate the stock is undervalued, or it may indicate the stock is premium. Calculate: Divide the current stock price by the sales per share.

Price/CF Ratio-Measures the value of a stock’s price relative to its operating cash flow per share. Shows how much cash a company generates relative to its stock price, or how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of cashflow. Calculate: Current stock price divided by operating cash flow per share.

Earnings Per Share-Shows how much money a company makes for each share and what the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. Higher EPS indicates more value because investors will pay more for a company with higher profits. Calculated: Net income divided by the stocks float.

These ratios are great for determining how a company compares to its competitors in the same sector.

Are there any ratios specifically helpful in research penny stocks or will these provide me with sufficient information?",2020-02-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ezhwmx/my_guide_for_researching_a_stock_using_financial/
