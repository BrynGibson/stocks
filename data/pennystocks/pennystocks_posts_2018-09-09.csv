**2. Sonasoft announces it will become an AI-First Company (Artificial Intelligence)**   


Sonasoft will be entering the AI arena but integrating AI solutions into some of its existing email and eDiscovery products/services. But further, has stated that it will be developing “New and disruptive AI solutions”.   


The AI Industry has been exponentially growing, and Sonasoft is positioned with its soon-to-be acquired Cornerstone Technologies, in the EPICENTRE for technology developments. The Artificial Intelligence Industry is estimated to be worth $1.2 TRILLION by 2020.

**3. Sonasoft completes 2 year audit and applies to uplist to OTCQB Venture Exchange on Sept 5, 2018.**   


This is a key step voluntarily taken by the company which independently verifies the company’s financial statements and is sure to leave shareholders feeling confident in their investment. This is just another step to further bolster the company at its core, allowing it to launch forward with its highly ambitious growth strategy which was announced in February 2018. Sources: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Corp-SSFT-Announces-the-Completion-of-2-year-Audit-and-Uplist-Application-for-OTCQB-Venture-Exchange?id=202768](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Corp-SSFT-Announces-the-Completion-of-2-year-Audit-and-Uplist-Application-for-OTCQB-Venture-Exchange?id=202768)

**Forward Looking Catalysts**   


**1. Uplist to the OTCQB Venture Exchange** \- Uplisting to the OTCQB Exchange provides shareholders with greater transparency, opens the stock up to new market-makers, and is likely to attract larger independent and institutional investors. When listed on the OTCQB Exchange, the public will have access to free in-depth Level II quotes, and the company will be able to reach a broader audience of investors through the various “visibility” resources provided to companies on the exchange such as the OTCQB Podcast, social platforms, newsletter, and website.   


**2. The Completion of the Cornerstone Technologies Acquisition**   


The acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies will be finalized upon audit completion of their financial statements. This is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Cornerstone Technologies is a key delivery partner for Microsoft, Dell/EMC, cloud, and infrastructure-based solutions as well as engineering solutions for TransVault, Veritas, and Exterro. The Silicon Valley-based IT company has built an impressive list of customers across multiple verticals including retail, high tech, healthcare, state and local government, and financial services. The merging of Cornerstone Technologies with Sonasoft will add an estimated $13M in annual revenues. This would mark a 1500% increase from Sonasoft’s fiscal 2017 revenues. (It’s actually closer to 3000% from $570k in 2017)   


The company recently announced a contract worth roughly $250k with the Golden Gate Bridge. Upon completion of the Cornerstone Technologies acquisition, the company has stated that contracts and news releases of this calibre can be expected regularly.   


“The Company anticipates exponential growth as a result of the Cornerstone acquisition, and shareholders can expect to hear about major contracts with large enterprise customers regularly. The previously announced Golden Gate Bridge contract is just the tip of the iceberg.” Stated Mike Khanna, in the most recent press release.

**3. Preferred Stock Initiative**   


The Company will issue preferred stock and implement an initiative that will allow shareholders to convert their common stock into preferred stock. The Company anticipates that at least 25 percent of its outstanding shares will be converted into preferred stock. This roll-up will tighten the float of tradable shares, add investment stability, and assure investors that many of the large stakeholders are taking a long-term view to their investments. The company has already begun this process and will provide further details in the coming weeks.   


**4. New and Disruptive (AI) Artificial Intelligence Products/Solutions –** As mentioned above, and in recent press, the company is implementing AI Solutions for their current line of eDIscover and email archiving products/solutions. FURTHER, the company has stated that they are currently developing new and disruptive AI products/solutions. As previously stated, this industry is growing rapidly and is estimated to be worth $1.2Trillion by 2020. How big of a piece of the $1.2 Trillion will the company be able to capture? Even 1% would be $12Billion.   


**5. Ongoing Deals and New Large Enterprise Clients –** One would expect the core business of eDiscovery, email archiving, and other tech products/solutions to continue to thrive. **With the addition of Cornerstone Technologies and its annual $13Million book of business, the company has announced that shareholders can expect** ***REGULAR*** **announcements of contracts with Large Enterprise Clients, such as the recently announced deal with Golden Gate Bridge worth $250k. The $250k may not sound like much, but if a deal like this is made once a week we are talking an additional $13M/year.**
