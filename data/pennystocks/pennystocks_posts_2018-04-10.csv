LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 10, 2018 / Applied Biosciences Corp. (OTCQB: APPB), a diversified cannabinoid therapeutics company focused on the medical, bioceutical and pet health industries, announced that it has expanded its product line and launched a hemp-derived CBD product line under the Remedi CBD brand. The products will be sold on Remedi's new website (www.remedishop.com) and in select locations in the U.S.

As the health and wellness market continues to more broadly accept the therapeutic properties and applications of hemp, Applied Biosciences is working closely with doctors, scientists, industry advocates and the general public to ensure each group is receiving accurate, reliable and helpful information regarding the benefits of CBD and our branded line of products.

Applied Biosciences uses organic ingredients and formulations that were created to target common ailments in the health and wellness industry for anyone who is open to trying hemp derived products. The products use industrial hemp as an input to produce high quality CBD for a variety of health and wellness products.

Chris Bridges, President of Applied Biosciences stated, ""According to the Hemp Business Journal (www.hempbizjournal.com), the hemp-derived CBD products market is expected to surpass $450 million by 2020 and we are pleased to be getting involved during the industry's infancy. With the overall CBD market expected to surpass $2.1 billion by 2020, we feel strongly that the legalization and availability of hemp-based products stands to attract the lion's share of the market as hemp-based CBD products overcome the federally imposed hurdles.""

JJ Southard, Vice President of Products at Applied Biosciences Corp. added, ""It is important for consumers to be educated on the differences between hemp-based CBD for multiple reasons including efficacy, legality and safety. Hemp-derived CBDs provide an attractive alternative for people looking to reap the medical benefits of CBD, but who cannot obtain cannabis due to legality issues, or simply do not want to experience the psychoactive effects of THC.""

The new e-store, Remedishop.com, currently offers the Applied Biosciences line of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) isolate infused gummies, topicals and tinctures. Applied Biosciences is continuing to launch its product lines in select specialty and retail stores.

The organic CBD gummies come in both daytime and nighttime formulations, with the additions of melatonin to facilitate healthy sleep cycles. The all-natural topical CBD lotions for pain and inflammation absorb quickly and are pleasantly scented with blood orange essential oil. The full-spectrum hemp-derived CBD tinctures come in a wide range of strengths to make dosing easier and are offered in peppermint and flavorless varieties.

CBD is the non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in hemp and has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions and ailments. CBD is a natural compound which functions naturally and seamlessly in the body. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds derived from hemp and have shown the ability to stimulate the endocannabinoid system and provide therapeutic relief to many ailments.
