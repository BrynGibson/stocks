Here are some facts about the opportunity. Much more to discuss which can be done in comment section with those who find the subject interesting.

The company has phase 2b ongoing, results are likely due in August or September. See earlier results below:

Compassionate study:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438479/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5438479/) (search for ""Human Expanded Access"")

https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/rockefeller-institute-drug-provides-hope-for-alzheimer-s-treatment/article\_bf5bab5f-e40e-5f47-95ca-666f14b795e0.html

Phase 1/2:

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02221947?term=neurotrope&amp;rank=3

Phase 2:

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?term=neurotrope&amp;rank=2

In previous phase 2 company failed to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint. But they did achieve statistical significance for predefined subgroup (p=0.012). Current ongoing phase 2b is based on these past results from compassionate and phase 1&amp;2 studies which have clearly indicated the optimal dose and other variables:

https://neurotrope.com/neurotrope-announces-publication-of-phase-2-study-of-bryostatin-1-in-moderate-to-severe-alzheimers-disease-in-the-journal-of-alzheimers-disease/

Below, I have run some standard t-tests based on published phase 2 data to get p values for two scenarios related to the upcoming phase 2b results. The first test is post-hoc type of test grouping patients in previous phase 2 to two distinct groups. The second one is testing what would happen if ongoing phase 2b have similar characteristics as the previous phase 2.

Test: ""Bryostatin-1 treated patients not on memantine had better outcome (SIB score) than placebo patients or patients on memantine (since memantine appears to block most of the treatment effect of Bryostatin-1 in this indication).""

Result: With p&lt;0.0001 it can be concluded that patients treated with bryostatin but not having memantine had better outcome (SIB score) than rest of the patient population.

Test: ""If phase 2b shows the same treatment effect and standard deviation as previous phase 2 will the study meet the primary endpoint (change in SIB score).""

Result: Yes, with p&lt;0.0001. It can be concluded that if ongoing phase 2b patient population has similar treatment effect and standard deviation values that have already been seen in the previous phase 2 study the primary endpoint of the study will be met with p &lt; 0.0001.

Based on available information I would say there's over 80% chance that phase 2b will be successful. Furthermore Bryostatin-1 appears to treat and potentially reverse Alzheimer's disease, not just slow down the progression which unfortunately has been the goal of all other studies and investigational drugs so far.

So what about valuation?

Axovant (AXON) had a market cap of around 2,5 billion based on phase 2 results where from many different subgroups that were analysed one subgroup was found out to potentially slightly slow down the disease progression. Predictably phase 3 failed.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intepirdine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intepirdine)

https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/intepirdine

Last July Biogen (BIIB) and Eisai (4523.T) announced that their investigational drug potentially slightly slowed down the progression of disease in one of the subgroups in phase 2 study. As a result  market cap of the companies immediatelly increased by 20 billion (couple of weeks later it was found out that the actual results weren't that good after all):

[https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/05/1533998/0/en/Eisai-and-Biogen-Announce-Positive-Topline-Results-of-the-Final-Analysis-for-BAN2401-at-18-Months.html](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/05/1533998/0/en/Eisai-and-Biogen-Announce-Positive-Topline-Results-of-the-Final-Analysis-for-BAN2401-at-18-Months.html)

These two examples (and many others), the lack of any effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease, the huge and growing amount of patients suffering from Alzheimer's and the potential ability of Bryostatin-1 to not only treat but also reverse the disease mean that once proved effective Bryostatin-1 can potentially be the most valuable drug ever invented. After current phase 2b results it may be approved for the severe patient population without further studies with future studies expanding the usage to all stages of Alzheimer's disease (so that people wouldn't need to wait until they progress to get the treatment):

[https://newyork.legalexaminer.com/health/senior-care/advancements-in-alzheimers-treatment-interview-with-dr-daniel-alkon/](https://newyork.legalexaminer.com/health/senior-care/advancements-in-alzheimers-treatment-interview-with-dr-daniel-alkon/)

Based on available data it seems clear that successful phase 2b study on this indication alone (bryostatin-1 and company's other patented PKC epsilon activators have many other potential CNS target indications) could result a valuation somewhere between 5 billion and 30 billion. Fully diluted share count is around 25 million (float 13 million) which would translate to $200-$1200 price per share.

Everything put together I think this is the largest opportunity in existence in biotech sector. The upside is huge and data is going to be available soon. And thanks to the previous phase 2 data, the risk has been greatly reduced and there are clear reasons to anticipate clean positive data.

TULSA, OK, Feb. 04, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- *via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- RJD Green Inc. (OTCPK: RJDG) CEO Ron Brewer updates shareholders on 2018 activity and anticipated 2019 growth.*   


Dear Valued RJD Green Shareholders,

As we have finished our 2018 fiscal year and moved into the 2019 fiscal year, RJD Green’s management team would like to take the opportunity to update all existing and potential shareholders with the latest information on developments with the company. Please be advised – this letter is not a substitute for reviewing our press releases and SEC filings. Some of this update is opinion – so be sure to note the forward-looking statements disclosure. We wanted to simplify the complexity and put our latest news items in context and keep you updated on our activities and events that may not rise to the level of a press release or SEC filing.

We continue to work diligently to execute our business model to create a substantive holding company with a focus of acquiring and managing assets and companies. RJD Green operates in three divisions: 

**RJD Green Healthcare Services Division,** which owns **IOSoft Inc.** a company that provides discrete payment technologies, services and software that can be integrated into targeted offerings for healthcare provider networks, hospitals, healthcare payers and individual providers; 

**Silex Holdings Division,** which offers installed granite/other counter tops, cabinets and related products to the residential builder, commercial contractor, remodeling contractor and retail customers; 

**Earthlinc Environmental Services Division**, which provides green environmental services and technologies. 

In the past 12 months:

**RJD Green Healthcare Services Division, which owns IOSoft Inc.:**  For 2018, IoSoft is fully launched and initial contracts are being serviced and creating revenues. The management of IoSoft feels confident that steady growth and revenue can be achieved in 2019.

RJD Green Inc.’s Healthcare Services Division announced the company has refined their ability to quickly and painlessly customize all software products to the special needs of each account. IoSoft’s initial clients are utilizing White Label licensing agreements to provide the software and processing services of IoSoft within their own corporate brand. 

IoSoft Division of RJD Green Inc. has executed its first non-medical insurance sector contract. The contract is a private labeling agreement to provide payment services and the licensing of their recently launched Unified Payment System technology platform including Vcheck, a patent pending virtual check technology. The Company is a twenty year-old third party administrator with a client focus in the insurance sector. IRG Resource Group introduced and facilitated the transaction with IoSoft. After research and review, IoSoft was chosen to provide ""best in class"" payment technology to include its industry leading Virtual Check.

As well, IoSoft has reorganized its sales team and efforts to include other markets where IoSoft has been approached by interested entities in additional markets such as hospitality and legal services where large volume payment processing occurs.

Vincent Valentine, IoSoft Inc. President, states: “We are excited to be solidifying our efforts on existing agreements and reaching new business sectors that create diversity of our revenue streams. The journey has been much longer than ever anticipated, but we feel the potential for clients and revenue has actually increased during the time passage.”

RJD Green is in discussions with two possible synergistic acquisition and merger candidates as we enter 2019 with a focus of completing an additional acquisition that extends “our services to healthcare companies” platform.

**Silex Holdings Division**

The commercial division continues its revenue growth and geographic expansion with new commercial contracts awarded Silex this year. Many of the commercial contracts awarded Silex are creating backlog within the next six months of 2019. 

Silex Holdings has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a well-established industrial manufacturer in the South-West United States market. The Company offers an excellent growth opportunity in a related industry with increased profitability and revenue to Silex Holdings. The initial projections by the companies reflect a ten percent growth in revenue profitability. Upon consummation of this acquisition, the Silex Holdings Division total annual revenue would be over $10,000,000 annually prior to the organic revenue growth expected.

As Silex Interiors expands with additional regional locations, the commercial division will act for all locations in regard to commercial and multi-family projects, which maintains our proven controls and profitability success while increasing the division’s revenues. 

**Earthlinc Environmental Division**

The Earthlinc Division enters 2019 with its initial Memorandum of Understanding for the purchase of an established environmental consulting and engineering firm. The 2019 focus is to acquire three such entities in strategic regions of the United States, which creates national coverage for corporate, industrial and institutional clients.

Earthlinc Environmental Division has acquired industrial property to be utilized for an initial animal waste processing facility. The property acquired is located in Nowata, Oklahoma, a strategic location for Mid-America transportation, and it is in the heart of commercial meat farming and oil &amp; gas services. The development plan allows for two separate operations on the property. The plan has been delayed as RJD Green capital resources were being placed in more prioritized projects. The development of theses services is targeted after the completion of a revenue producing acquisition in each of the three RJDG divisions.

The first of the two projects are an animal waste processing facility to be utilized for demonstration and ongoing development of environmentally friendly, and cost saving processes and services.

The second project is a Waste Oil Recovery facility that will utilize proprietary processes previously acquired by Earthlinc that creates efficiencies in the oil recovery process and returns a higher ratio of salable oil recovery from the waste oil barrels processed. 

**2018 Financial Results**

Revenue                     $3,900,034                 Current Assets                        $1,269,377

Cost of Goods               2,266,450                 Long-term Assets                        777,122

G &amp; A                           1,339,722                 Total Assets                            $2,046,499

Net Operating Profit     $   294,622

                                                                    Current Liabilities                    $1,146,959

We will continue to update our investors with any and all progress in the coming months as newsworthy occurrences happen.

In closing, the vision of RJD Green Inc. is clear. We have accomplished a great deal in creating the groundwork and solid platform for growth. We will continue to target creating accelerated growth. Our focus is to continue building a solid company with rapid growth potential, and we remain committed to pursuing initiatives that maximize value for all RJD Green stakeholders.
