NEW YORK, Oct. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – NetworkNewsAudio announces the Audio Press Release (APR) titled “Growth of Blockchain Provides Financial Services for Underserved Markets,” featuring [SinglePoint, Inc. (OTCQB: SING)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HqyT2AhAby_F3XUoJX6VxhUA05W7pOQ7cKTyjtq-8XARjkKTljaLfW0Rv2LlSV6aA3vQmgphMgJ_h0KyNqWiGnTUXeLzH352Lhb_Cfe362g_i7h2cefEMzzwX1RlgZbu2K9SuNpL0WPqEk7SDFFU6Y8P05k3qWpSZu-Orz9ZCh0=).

Celebrity endorsements have added to the credibility of crypto. When Harrington shows faith in blockchain by acting as a spokesman for SinglePoint, people pay attention. With his high public profile and reputation for savvy business dealings, he’s showing that business insiders believe in blockchain.

As cryptocurrency ATMs appear on the streets of Japan and SingleCoin wallets appear on ordinary consumers’ phones, it’s clear that blockchain is about to hit the mainstream. What was once a specialist payment tool for computer programmers, then a novel form of asset for investors, is now a widespread way of paying for goods and services.

I rarely post on reddit so excuse me if I’m not doing this right. I’ve been researching BPMX when I read that the CEO bought over $100K in shares. Is this sign of short term or long term growth? They’re in the midst of a 12 week FDA trial on treating rosacea and with the recent news of the CEO investing more that’s a good sign the trial may work? What are your thoughts on this?

However, from when I put them on my watchlist 2 weeks ago it’s gone up almost 400%, .0004 to .0020 as of close today.  They seem to be on an upward trend, especially with the recent news that they’re expanding into the Cannabis field.  If anyone knows anything else on this stock please post on here.

Thanks, and good hunting.
