The results for the dosing efficacy otherwise known as Phase 2b Part A were released topline in November 2018 [http://www.antibethera.com/2018/11/27/antibe-therapeutics-announces-successful-completion-of-part-one-of-phase-2b-dose-ranging-efficacy-study-for-atb-346/](http://www.antibethera.com/2018/11/27/antibe-therapeutics-announces-successful-completion-of-part-one-of-phase-2b-dose-ranging-efficacy-study-for-atb-346/)

&amp;#x200B;

The next event is the start of Phase 2b Part B - The Final Phase 2 Trials.  This is the efficacy study on 250 Osteoarthritis patients.  Double Blinded and Placebo.   The trial starts January 2019 and Results in Q2 2019 i.e. April to June 2019.  However Phase 2b - GI study was the real hurdle and was very successful.   The price is climbing on no news because the trial is about to start.  The SP will easily be double today's close prior to the results readout.  

Antibe received approval from Health Canada in August 2017 to conduct a  Phase 2, double blind GI safety trial of ATB-346 in 244 healthy  volunteers. The study was designed to demonstrate the superiority of  ATB-346 in GI safety compared to naproxen, the most prescribed  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (“NSAID”) in the USA. One group was  treated for 14 days with ATB-346 (250 mg once daily) while the other  group was treated for 14 days with the standard prescription dose of  naproxen (500 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint for the study was  the incidence of gastric or duodenal ulcers of at least 3 mm diameter  with unequivocal depth, considered the gold standard in assessing the GI  safety of NSAIDs. On March 20, 2018, Antibe announced that ATB-346  successfully met the primary endpoint in the study. Subjects on ATB-346  exhibited an ulceration rate of 2.5% (3/118) versus an ulceration rate  of 42.1% (53/126) for subjects on naproxen at the end of the treatment  period, with a very high degree of statistical significance  (p&lt;0.001). ATB-346 was also safe and well tolerated. A detailed  summary of the clinical trial results, including secondary endpoints,  will be available for release in Q2 2018. ",2019-01-02

I think the run up prior to results is inevitable. We went 500% on the prior trial in the run up and that was with nothing but a tiny phase 2A study and hopes.

We now have a deal valuing atb346 at this current time at 600M with double digit royalties... after this next trial if the dosage goes down ( which I surmise it will based on the plotted half life and accumulation of the drug ) we will have an even more attractive candidate and the inherent value will only go up. I wouldnt be surprised to see a valuation deal of atb346 of 950M or over. If the pain reduction is consistent and verified with the first 2A pain trial it will be over 1 billion for sure, guaranteed, no questions asked. 

Extrapolate the cash bonus theyd get for signing as well as the future potential value of the next 2 drugs (atb352 specifically) and I could see a pipeline valuation of $2B, not even pumping absurdly or exaggerating.

People should keep in mind that after the stock ""pops"" after next results (if they're good) there will probably be another significant retracement/sell off. While we did get rid of a TON of warrants this December, there's still like 20 million or so out there at a very low strike price, so after the next results it is likely those warrant holders will exercise and many of them will sell due to instant gains. This is what happened last March/all summer after the last results. Sadly I was unaware of the share structure, so I held through all that selling. Became aware and realized we'd likely sell off to near the strike price, which we did, and then start heading back up after the warrants all expired on December 21st, which we did. 

Looking forward to hopefully really great things with this stock. There is still some risk, for sure, even before the test results come out. There is some history of adverse reactions to this drug, although it was some guy with pre-existing liver issues who lied and never should have been in the study, when he came down with his issues though, and the news was released, the stock went from 50 cents to 5 cents essentially over night.

Any trader/analysts should be able to anticipate that another run up is likely. We also just go rid of a crap ton of low strike price warrants in December, and there's no more significant quantity of warrants until June 2020 expiry. So there's very little headwind right now and a whole lot of tail wind from what I can see. 

Meanwhile, POST results, anyone can see what happened last time, an initial pop and then a long, slow bleed. It bled off due to low strike price warrants expiring within the first couple months, and then many more expiring in December. We will have a similar scenario with these results, though somewhat different. We'll have a hell of a lot more warrants out there that will be very in the money, but they will expire quite a ways further out... Plus the drug will then have a lot more credibility.

My understanding is that we can expect both the dose ranging efficacy and the Phase 2B Part B results in Spring 2019.

The reason to get in now is that warrants that have been holding this thing way below fair value just expired on December 21st (and almost all were exercised, showing both confidence from investors, and that ATE got some more cash to use), and also because we all can see how well ATE performed before its last big study results were released, and so traders are going to try and hop in for not just the results, but also the pre-results run up.

I fully expect ATE to be around 60-70 cents before the Phase 2B Part 2 results are released, and with no other catalyst really... Then the results, if positive, should get us well over $1.",2019-01-02

Always found the $20 price targets people come up with with napkin math to be ridiculously optimistic. But $3 seems perfectly realistic.

What I'd find amazing though is, it seems there may be some cancer fighting and maybe even colitis fighting properties to ATB-346 and the H2S pipeline of drugs.

However, after these results the main catalyst will be the FDA meeting in summer 2019.   Given ATE can demonstrate superiority above naopraxen and have metabolites and pharmacology  with the GI study, should be an easy approval, good on ATE for taking a step back to get everything in order.  Partnership will occur afterwards with an American and Western European company $$$.  I battle back and forth about selling the news.  But a biotech with superior Phase 2 results that are complete, no debt and FDA approval will not be falling back below .80/share and the upside is far greater with a surprise partnership.   Likely to occur is a reverse share split to uplist the company on NASDAQ with shareholders voted for the last few years.  I think its very likely to occur prior to the June 2019 Annual Meeting with a strong volume supporting an SP north of .80/share.  Which would be great!

• Mr. Andrew Powell, who played a key role in a number of biopharmaceutical deals exceeding $6 billion each, including the sale of Medivation to Pfizer, the sale of InterMune to Roche, and the sale of ImClone to Eli Lilly.
