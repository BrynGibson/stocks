China acknowledged that temperature scans are not sufficient to detect carriers who are asymptomatic, this means global testing capacities need to improve as soon as possible. 

* Co-diagnostics's (**CODX**) CDI test is able to detect 2019-nCoV in asymptomatic patients, which is critical for preventing spread as the incubation period can be as long as 14 days, and takes around 45 minutes. Additionally, the test is high-throughput with the ability to run 48 samples at once, which is important, considering that governments are target clients, it is cost efficient. One of the reasons the development for 2019-nCoV has been so rapid is the CoDx design software, which automates the discovery process and helps design the CoPrimers faster than could be done by hand. (http://codiagnostics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Maxim-Update-CODX-.2.18.20.pdf)

Co-diagnostics received CE approval to market their test kits in Europe on Monday, which was great timing because Europe just began getting hit hard. On Sunday, Iran stated that they only had 50 test kits are are largely unprepared (https://irannewsupdate.com/news/socially/6883-shocking-confession-of-iranian-regime-s-secrecy-over-the-coronavirus-two-doctors-die-in-one-night.html).

A major part of containment is personal protection equipment for medical staff and the population. Medical professionals have already stated that we are fundamentally unprepared for a pandemic due to shortages in medical supplies and the global ability to treat the infected. https://imgur.com/c5NOGN2

* Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. (**AHPI**) manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of respiratory products used in the health care industry to hospitals, hospital equipment dealers, hospital construction contractors, home health care dealers, and emergency medical product dealers. Its products include respiratory care products, medical gas equipment, and emergency medical products. 

* Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. (**APT**) develops, manufactures and markets disposable and limited use protective apparel products for the industries, clean room, medical and dental markets. The company operates through the followings segments: Disposable Protective Apparel segment, Building Supply segment and Infection Control segment. The Disposable Protective Apparel segment includes many different styles of disposable products, such as shoe covers, bouffant caps, gowns, coveralls, lab coats, frocks and other miscellaneous products.

Both APT and AHPI will see a big spike due to domestic and global demand increasing.",2020-02-27

I was hoping it would go under $1 but I when I logged on it was at 1.80 and I didn't feel it was worth it. In hindsight I think it may go up on monday so if I can get it in the low 2s I may only get 100 or so shares.,2020-02-27

I read that this company was among a list of a small few that might be used to mass produce a vaccine if one is made yesterday and this told me a few things

1. It isn't guarneteed that this company will be used for this purpose

2. People believe this company WILL be used for this purpose

3. It will likely rise if people are still fearing the virus more tomorrow (duh)

4. It might not pass its all-time high that it had during Ebola outbreak (it did 
for a short moment today) (there was a 10 to 1 reverse split since then so it doesn't look like it, meaning people might not realize it)

5. If it does pass it, sell.",2020-02-27

I also made money off crypto - the key was getting in VERY early so even after all the dumps I still came out with 400% gains (I also got burned - I had 2000% unrealized gains at one point). 

Right now is getting in very early for MMED. There is nothing wrong with believing in a future technology. A bumpy ride is expected. Cannabis also moved with hype but people who got in early are still very much in the green, and the industry is improving.",2020-02-27
