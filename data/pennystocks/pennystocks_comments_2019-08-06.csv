Alot of money to be made when a stock goes bankrupt or is a few days from delisting. Thise pumps can be massive but if you are new, I'd stay away.

I'm under the impression nakd will run on extension news for their delisting period and will probably r/s to get over $1. They had an offering at .10 just a few weeks ago, if they delist that is straight criminal",2019-08-06
