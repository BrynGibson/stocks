If you have a Merrill Edge account, you can no longer make trades on stocks that are less than $5/share. In order to sell, you have to jump through a bunch of hoops and other shit. This is fucking bullshit! I should be able to make that decision myself. FUCK MERRILL EDGE!!!!! If I want to take that much risk, it should be my decision. It's my fucking money! Fuck them! I hear a lot about Robbin Hood. Is it any good for penny stocks? What do you recommend? Thanks.",2018-08-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/96efgy/best_platform_for_penny_stocks/
2,[DD] $RKDA - Good Wheat Market,96goac,aurochfam,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/96goac/dd_rkda_good_wheat_market/,21,6,"$RKDA is a plant breeding company. It is nearing 10 years of product development, this is how long it takes to release new wheat varieties onto the commerical market. Therefore, they are currently at the position of product commercialization for their main product goodwheat. As we speak wheat millers are processing their first batch of wheat which they will provide to product makers like specialty baking companies. Their shtick is niche consumer -traits like low-gluten and better wheat composition for digestion. The miller testing their product is the largest in the USA who, if they find value in their product will create a major partnership with their company. Two other sources of major PR will be access to Chinese markets and FDA approval of their health claims. Additionally, they own IP on drought resistant soybean and long-last tomatoes which I suspect they may leverage as licensing or sell outright to bigger boys in the plant biotech industry to focus on the wheat industry.

They have fast access to the US farmers market through their Farmers Business Network partnership which is a silicon valley company which provides price matched resources (seed, pesticides, etc... ) as well as suggestions for which seed to plant based on neighbors yields/profits. Once goodwheat lines take hold they will be a premium commodity get promotion through the FBN.

Current price action is near an all time low after multiple positive PR's and a positive ER (transitioning from accepting research grants to focusing on mobilization of their miller partnerships. It has been daytraded to hell since a r/s in the past year where the price spiked to 60 dollars and has been bled out and diluted to \~5-6 dollars where it is currently. Their recent dilution have accumulated approximately 20 million dollarrs which they will use to fund the mobilization. They have at most 1 more dilution left in them before they start turning major products after miller-product testing this season. If they do dilute again I will pull money to invest in it for the medium-long term.

Wheat is especpially an interesting product because Wheat is one of the least innovated crops due to breeding difficulties, so a new product like goodwheat has the potential to shift a large portion of the market.

I have closely observed a single penny stock which has taken off, TNDM. This company is very similar to the foundation they've built and the trajectory they're about to pass.",2018-08-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/96goac/dd_rkda_good_wheat_market/

I read somewhere that if you keep shares for over a year, you are taxed at 15%. I day trade and swing trade, so what are the rules with that? Thanks
