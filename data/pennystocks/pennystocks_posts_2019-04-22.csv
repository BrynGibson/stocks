3,OMED merger details,bg8h4x,ertmeister,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bg8h4x/omed_merger_details/,3,0,"[merger deets](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/TraderNews.aspx?id=ECA2019-78)

Baby‚Äôs first merger here, can someone shed some light on this for me? 

Does this mean that the ADS issued for each share tomorrow at COB will be basically the price of OMED, plus .127 of a share of MREO in USD? 

So like if the merger was happening today it would be .91+(2.14x.127)=1.18. So each ADS would be worth 1.18? 

Or is the ADS going to take into account more than just the SP when it‚Äôs calculated, and we‚Äôll all be surprised Wednesday morning? I‚Äôm not sure what else factors into what the price is going to be. I‚Äôd seen PTs between 1.20-1.50, and I don‚Äôt know how they get those numbers... 

To me, it seems like it‚Äôs smart to hold through the merger, big company buying smaller company, what‚Äôs not to love? My DD says hold, but I‚Äôm a total noob, so am I generally correct in my suspicions or should I bail and take the loss before it plummets further?",2019-04-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bg8h4x/omed_merger_details/
