Their closest competitor is Charlotte's Web, and they are getting ready to go public, but only in Canada I believe. So CVSI has a chance to dominate once they get on the Nasdaq.

Dont overlook the fact that the GI safety data are astoundingly good, no change in blood pressure is a huge derisk, and the clues we have on efficacy (TXB2 data) are all pointing to a successful next trial.

They have stated that they are continuing to test the liver enzymes during efficacy trial, with two of the doses being lower. Assuming the dose effects the liver numbers, then should be good. As long as it is the same as current NSAIDS on all aspects but superior on GI safety it’s a huge win, the increased efficacy that stated in 2A was a bonus, so if they can match or slightly beat those numbers, bring down liver damage and be GI safe, buckle up, we are going for a ride.",2018-08-29

They own this with Intesa Sanpalo, large bank in Italy with over 8 million customers. Have a deal with Samsung where the app is being automatically provided on new phones in Europe. The Robin Hood app was valued at around a billion in latest financing deal and they had less customers. So what’s marketwall worth? Eventually Marketwall will do a financing that puts a value a value on it and the market here will wake and say wait a minute, ALY owns 49% of this??? This asset worth more than the entire market cap of the company right now. Now the core business operations of ALY is their machine learning platform, capital cube which analyzes 50,000 stocks world wide and they just signed a distribution agreement with Thomson Reuters. They also have Workflow management software with bunch of customers and seeing revenues increase 30% quarter over quarter. Their YTD revenues are up 80% year over year and are inching closer to profitability. 1.8 mill of working capital presently so no risk of a PP for now. Will do top line sales north of $10 mill inclusive of revenue from marketwall that is not consolidated in their financials.
