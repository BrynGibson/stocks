This is snake oil. for one its just water and CBD, absorbtion is going to be next to nothing, you need a liposomal carrier of some sort to be really effective. You also need 2-6mg of CBD per 10 pounds of body weight to have basically any effect. So would need to weigh 15-50lbs for this to do anything.

I think you will be happy in two days. In two days, they are releasing their analyst update in which last October Goldman states them to be at .25 a share. Never reached it but I would imagine it will be close to .28-.33 this time. They are also talking about a 1.5 million contract with GNBT. I am guessing it won’t reach that high but I can see this price peaking around .17 by Thursday. Obviously, I hope as I have been following this company for over a year now and very optimistic. There are other nay-sayers out there though. But who knows. Best of luck to you! ",2019-02-26

100,ChuckJA,ehenjuw,/r/pennystocks/comments/auv0z4/when_to_sell/ehenjuw/,1,"As much as I loath Jim Cramer in general, his philosophy on trading small winners is spot on: Sell 20% of initial investment after a 20% rise. Sell remaining 80% of initial investment after 100% rise. Let remaining position ride out to its full potential.

As soon as your initial investment principal is recaptured, all anxiety melts away and you can think clearly about long term vs short term returns and the risks associated. ",2019-02-26
