SAN JOSE, CA, May 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE – [Sonasoft](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f0Y_LwD5G8Bp8MoVNKsstlq1JlikLYa3nzLz62IT4Byh1Podzg63yDoBpYirnRuLCb_MHQl0gTRylVRUJZnASQ==) Corp. ([OTCQB: SSFT](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pQ3NctZSPK_ZAEi0LyC_4303ahzIVey9sGbKZvpWKPf3g9Rk1Sco9_40NHHSpnPPepvafegcNuOmki3Ek6Ibd9qEbapRhPWNLXS-o_4QtLk=)), a leader in innovative eDiscovery and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions is pleased to announce that it has signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the data engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) company, E-Connect Software, Inc., and all its related interests, assets, and intellectual property. The acquisition is expected to become final after the audit completion of E-Connect Software’s financial statements.

E-Connect Software, Inc. is a data engineering and AI consulting firm with deep expertise and a proven track record in data management, cloud migrations, and data integration. E-Connect Software has an unaudited 2018 revenue estimated to be over $2.5 million with a net profit that exceeds 12 percent. E-Connect Software is based in Fremont, California.

“We transform our customers’ data into intelligence,” said Frank Velasquez, CEO of Sonasoft.  “The acquisition of E-Connect Software rounds out our AI business strategy, and together, we will be a fierce competitor in the artificial intelligence market.  Just last week, we announced the completion of Hotify, which gives the Company additional intellectual property. We now have an artificial intelligence cloud-based platform, NuGene, that gives new insights and intelligent solutions to customer challenges. The acquisition of E-Connect Software extends our ability to apply data science to all customer data sets and then to leverage NuGene for more intelligent decision-making allowing for greater efficiencies and productivity across all industries. This gives Sonasoft the strength to be an end-to-end solution with services and IP.”

“When we approach prospective enterprises, we find that they recognize the immense value in our AI platform, but some do not possess the required expertise or resources to implement such a solution,” continued Frank Velasquez. “We can now approach these enterprises with not only the solution to give them a huge competitive advantage, but also provide the expertise required to ensure their AI projects deliver an immediately high ROI.  The synergy that E-Connect Software brings to our total AI offering provides a complete package that few if any competitors have.”

“The unification of E-Connect and Sonasoft will create immense potential, both from a product and delivery standpoint,” said Jay Sen, CIO of E-Connect Software. “We’ve discovered that nearly every organization has grand expectations relating to its deployment of artificial intelligence. E-Connect, combined with Sonasoft, will be capable of providing AI solutions at every step along the way to meet if not exceed these expectations. We intend to utilize Sonasoft’s NuGene AI Platform combined with our expertise in data engineering, data management, cloud migrations, and AI services to offer a complete solution to supercharge our customers’ journey into AI. We are extremely confident moving forward with our business plan, and we cannot wait to get it started.”

E-Connect is the first of two recently announced potential acquisitions under LOI to advance to a definitive agreement. The Company continues due diligence on the second potential acquisition, OPtimAIze, Inc., and will provide updates appropriately as discussions and reviews progress.

Further updates regarding the company and its archiving, eDiscovery, and artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives can be expected as initiatives continue to progress.

Dear Shareholders,

May 1, 2019

Further to my Newsletter to Shareholders of April 15, 2019 I want to report that I had a very successful trip to Taiwan and China, with meetings with very critical strategic partners. Some of the discussions I can outline in this newsletter and others must remain unpublished for now because of NDA restrictions. But the good news is that on my return to the U.S. I then traveled to Seattle to personally deliver, yesterday, our **Smart NB IoT Outdoor Air Quality Monitor** and our**NB IoT PCIe card** for certification! This is a major milestone for Tri Cascade, and certification will open up the door of NB IoT business opportunity in many ways.

One very important meeting that I had in Shanghai, China during my recent trip that I can briefly talk about was with Accton Technology Corporation and Quectel Wireless Solutions. Acction is a major technology powerhouse based in both Taiwan and China (see Accton’s backgroundinformation on page 2). We use the Quectel chip set (see also page 2 for Quectel’s background) in our IoT devices in accordance with T-Mobile’s requirements to use the best and most reliablechip set on the market! I had a very successful meeting with them both where we discussed the opportunity to jointly develop and deploy local NB IoT technology in China with China local Telecoms as SIM card telecommunications partners! We are in the process of preparing, for execution, a Collaboration Letter of Intent for the development relationship between Tri Cascade, Accton and Quectel.

So, please stay tuned valued Shareholders for additional exciting news as it continues to evolve. We plan to aggressively continue to add shareholder value through these key strategic relationships to build a solid and consistent revenue base.

Respectfully,

*Max C. Li.*

So, we are about to get a FINRA name change and ticker change! This is huge... Gman35 was right! 

CEO of BEMG....

Most of the stock is held by insiders and it has a tendency to exhibit unusual price increases.  CIBC World Markets owned calls in the second 1/2 of last year and the stock went up like 600% or something crazy like that.
