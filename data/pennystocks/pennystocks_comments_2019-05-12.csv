Ball valves are against many codes due to hammering of the fluids. Gate valves are used on all wellheads, but wellhead producers are a dime a dozen. Everything on paper looks too good to be true which makes me believe this could be a scam. Like a Russian oligarch is looking to launder his money, RMs with a ticker and buys failing companies to clean it.

My outlook his hugely speculative, but this shit happens all the time in pennystocks. I would need to see more on the companies they are buying out to see if they are legit or not.",2019-05-12

22,amphetaminesfailure,en8yqdt,/r/pennystocks/comments/bnprii/leas_monday/en8yqdt/,1," Former LEAS owner is in jail for fraud.  

Current owner is a strip club bouncer from New Jersey with no prior experience who somehow found a company with 50 million in assets that wants to RM into a shell with a bad reputation.  They're on their third attorney, with the second having a ban from working on the OTC.  

They've been trying to go current since February but keep getting the paperwork wrong.  

The company is still halted from trading in Canada.  

And apparently this company worth 50 million has just been sitting on their ass for a few months now while the shell continues to make mistake after mistake rather than pulling out and finding another to do a RM.  


It's not ""bashing"" to do DD, and post negative information when negative information is found.  

Again, I made money on it last time, and I wish I had gotten back in in the 1's last week.  I'm sure it will run close to or actually hit a penny this time.
