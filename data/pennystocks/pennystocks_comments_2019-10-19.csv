       A . 001 stock usually has outstanding shares in the 100 thousands or even billions . So the trading volume has to be high to move the stock upward. Look for the volume to spike in the 100 million with news. Than have a daily average of at least 30 million. 
      These stocks also do reverse splits to stay-in compliance or just to stay attractive to investors..they pay people to pump the stock and putout news to pump in hopes traders will spread their news.
      Don’t think that because it’s a cheap stock you can’t lose much. You can lose your money faster in a penny stock than you can a 5$ stock .
       Trading sub penny stocks can be very profitable. But you have to know what to look for. 
       Watch for volume spikes, news and continue upward trend into the next day. And don’t fall in love with the stock. Take your money and run run fast",2019-10-19

&gt;Hey guys, Im new as well.

He's pacing and leading, a common tactic used to relate with an audience.

&gt;I have been studying/reading/watching all the videos I can about penny stocks and different types of trading and investing on them for a month and a half now. You'll come across some of the big traders and they can make a 30 min video about how they have this pattern that always work but theyll never actually discuss it in depth unless you join their program paying 2000+ USD.

Again relatable behavior, wait for that sales pitch. He's getting inside the newbies head by anticipating what a newbie will think. This is commonly done by youtube marketers as well. They'll start a trading advertisement with ""I know what you're thinking,"" while going on to list all the counter arguments of likely legitimate traders.

&gt;Yes, this can be worth it but someone like me where I have X amount of dollars put aside to trade someday, it would be all dumped into this program and when im finished I would have to try and save up that money again.

Relatable to a newbie audience again.

&gt;I found this youtuber named SmarTrader, he has some absolute gems and explains patterns he uses and trades plus much more. He also has a discord group called Next Level Trades

There's the sales pitch. Ask yourself his motivation for writing this. Is it because he loves this community so much, that he wants to help you? Maybe if you're credulous, but consider this perspective. It's in his best interest to sell you a product. That product being:

&gt; He also has a discord group called Next Level Trades, I know I talked about fees big traders use for their programs, but you can pay 40 USD a month to become a trade member in the discord and get live alerts, SmarTrades and other members watch lists and more learning content.

Which is another charlatan trick to get subscribers. These types of scams date back centuries, beyond just the gilded age. Look into where the term ""snake-oil"" originated from. Perhaps this is only a digital variation of the same trick.

&gt; You can even ask for a free trial to see what its all about. But like I said, his videos are great for anyone and highly suggest newcomers and they costs ZERO dollars to watch. Check him out, he would make a great mentor.",2019-10-19
21,DecadentHam,f4bm55s,/r/pennystocks/comments/djwlyp/how_low_is_too_low/f4bm55s/,1,"I don't recommend investing in penny stocks. Especially OTCBB stocks. 99% of these companies are trash and many will disappear in a few years. Don't believe the hype and become another bag-holder. 

Is it possible to make money on penny stocks? Absolutely! But there's a lot of study ahead. A lot. The fact you're asking what level of volume to look for indicates you're lacking a lot of knowledge. I don't say this as an insult but to try and help you out. I've been there.

Save your money for now and go study for 3-6 months. Look for patterns, learn technical/fundamental analysis and understand what causes a stock to spike and crash. Pump? Earnings? Contract? Partnership? FDA?

There's so much to learn that it can take years to understand and be profitable. I'm far from perfect and know I still have years of learning ahead of me.

I'll give some advice:

Trade the ticker. Don't fall in love with the company. Trade and move on.

Get a decent broker. Ditch Robinhood, the executions are terrible.

And... Study! This isn't a get rich quick scheme. The market owes you nothing and will eat you alive. Learn the why's and how's.",2019-10-19

2. Maybe 1/10 times. There are many locate features. I normally don't short when either: the stocks locates are too expensive, or the stock isn't worth the locates, or both.

3. Oh that's a good question. Great question actually. Most people have no idea what I do. ""Oh that wolf of wallstreet thing"" or ""Oh you're gambling,"" are the two response I get. Most people can't do what I do, and I accept that. The only thing I can say is this: the better you get, expect to relate to less people in trading. IRL I'm great.",2019-10-19

If a stock goes from $3 to $4 premarket, that's $1 of range, yet I'm paying 10 cents a share for locates. To break even, I'd need a 10 cent win. 

Commissions are basically nothing, which is funny. These people tout their $0 commission brokers, yet I'm basically paying nothing for commissions, locating any stock I want, and I'm able to select the ECN I want. Oh, and they don't sell my data.",2019-10-19
