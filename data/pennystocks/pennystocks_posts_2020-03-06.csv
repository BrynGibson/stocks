Maybe we can cooperate as well. I'm a full time trader since last Friday :)

So far my right decisions:

1. INO. I invested one day before it went up +100%. I made the decision based on my analysis of the founder's capability. I sold at 2.4% profit because it was my first big investment and I wanted to not be greedy and play safe. Which thought me to not sell HTBX yet and I'm sitting at 90-110% profit for that rn, unrealized.

2. HTBX. I did the same analysis of the founder and his team. Invested a lot in the morning when nobody were talking about it online. Then it went up that day, which is yesterday.

3. Technically I didn't make a wrong decision (but I doubt if someone can make a wrong decision in this coronavirus market). My overall realized gain is 6% despite my early exits. 

I believe there's fresh money coming into the coronavirus market for at least 2 more weeks so I am spending every hour except sleep on trading. I believe this kind of opportunity occurs a few times in one's life time so I want to utilize it. I don't even have time to eat junk food, which is my bad addiction. I have a background in software engineering, psychology and marketing. So PM me if you'd like to chat. We can have group calls and brainstorm.

The Terms of their credit have been successfully renegotiated. R22  refridgerant ceased being produced this year. Their Stockpiles now have more value and they also own proprietary tech for recycling R22.  They had an earnings call today that beat expectations..I believe that Q2  and Q3 are going to be very good for this company and their stock will over double if you are willing to tie your money up in it for six months.
