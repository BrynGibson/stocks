3,TSXV: VGN -,8deapg,Cosmokramer111,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8deapg/tsxv_vgn/,5,11,"The CEO has been vocal on twitter. that the stock is cheap, and that 2018 could be a very good year https://imgur.com/a/yxYii . He hints at gold assets being a secret sauce, along with WEED, and Drones. I believe there was a $500k royalty payment due by Dec 31st from one of the gold assets.

According to SEDI filings VGN is a 10% owner of Labrador gold corp (TSXV: LAB) which is up over 100% in the last year.   LAB has been running the last few weeks with the CEO buying up shares during those weeks.  If Labrador gold continues its run the VGN position of 3-5million shares will be a considerable portion of the 4.5m market cap VGN currently holds today.   ***Their other holdings DVR and QCA have been performing nicely over the last month.***  

The icing on the cake for this company is it has a very low float. Shareholders are locked and aligned with the 16 year track record of Anthony Roodenburg. The CEO also puts his money where his mouth is. VGN approved a buyback program and has been buying up shares over the last year as recently as 500k shares at the end of Jan @ .13/share. (https://ceo.ca/vgn)

Shares outstanding: 41m

Retail float : ~21m

Share price: .115 (March 18 close)

Market Cap: $4.7m

52 Week range - .07 - .175.

The stock is hard to accumulate due to its low float. With buyback program running and willing to eat up .13 shares. Buying in chunks on pullbacks will ensure a good price. jmho

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- APT SYSTEMS, INC. (OTC Pink: APTY), a publicly traded and fully reporting company, is pleased to confirm this week that its subsidiary, Snapt Games, has acquired a relatively new iOS app with established positive cash flow.  It has been a long held goal of Snapt’s management to not only build but also actively acquire games and novelty apps for its portfolio. We anticipate our third in-house game will be released in May.

According to statistics presented by AppAnnie, Q4 in 2017 saw the largest gains for in-app purchases to date, noting over $12 billion spent on the iOS App Store and over $5 billion spent on Google Play. The two stores also saw over 175 billion downloads globally. The significance of these increases in consumer spending proves the mobile application marketplace continues to be a valuable industry. The App Store is poised to reach $139 billion in consumer spending by 2020. With the recent acquisition of its live wallpaper app, Snapt Games has the ability to jumpstart its entrance into one of the largest categories on the App Stores.

“We are going to spend the next two weeks adding to the app’s offerings and restructuring the marketing plan because we believe it will substantially increase the current monthly revenues of $12,950. We are excited to relaunch this app with a new look around May 1st,"" advised Glenda Dowie, CEO.

This transaction further emphasizes Management’s continued effort to grow the potential of its subsidiary companies and move all areas of the operation into positive revenue streams. Our other games, Chick Chick Boom and Hogg Wild continue to enjoy good ratings and we are expanding them to include an option for download revenues, in addition to the income generated from ads.  Watch our twitter feed @APTYsys for more sneak peaks of the new ‘Candy Chef’ game and more details on our great new acquisition.

I loaded up and within 15 minutes I was up 200%. Pretty fuckin insane, it's safe to say the float on this is pretty low, apparently there was a reverse split done on the restricted shares only but the details are still being filed out. Very likely this will run tomorrow on this, although who knows how many will take profit from that bounce. Might be able to play another bounce, so keep your eye on this one.",2018-04-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8diz3n/lrdr/
