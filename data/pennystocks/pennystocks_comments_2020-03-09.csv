That could happen any day but is expected no later than early April. The trial filled last December and concluded weeks ago. The CEO reiterated late March to early April in his latest interview.

It is also more than possible the stock runs up before the release in anticipation, especially with three conferences this month. It normally would, but in this tanking market, who knows?

When the insider purchase was made after the conclusion of the trial, on the open market, at market prices, that sealed the deal for me. An insider doesn‚Äôt buy 3,000,000 shares at market if the results aren‚Äôt expected to be good.

So take anything I‚Äôm saying with a grain of rice.

That being said, I‚Äôm no idiot.
I‚Äôm up 111% from where I started last Wednesday. 
So I will tell you what I‚Äôm planning on doing. 

I sold my all my AIM stock today for 83% profit.
I probably dropped a little too early. I sold at 6.12 and after market stocks hit a high of 8.64.
If I see prices continuing to climb back up that high during ore-market tomorrow I‚Äôm going to put in an order to buy more shares at a really conservative limit. Say maybe 6.00 limit.

What I‚Äôve noticed on these CV stocks is that if they‚Äôre creeping up real high during pre-market, at open a ton of people rush to sell there stocks at peak prices as soon as the market opens and there‚Äôs always a big dip in the first 30 minutes. 

Today it dropped from above 3.50 to down below 3.10 at open. Then it shot right back up and traded sideways for a while before exploding again. 

If you can capitalize on that initial dip you may still be able to pull some out of it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to try to do with some of the profit I made today and see if I can pull another 40-50% profit if I can buy in at 6 tomorrow and exit at 9.",2020-03-09

In their previous 10Q, you will find $17K of inventory value on their BS for the Q. This is relevant because, on 2/10/20 they filed an 8K, private placement, valued  at $10.2M  for 3.3M shares at $3.08 each. On 2/27/2020, they filed another 8K for $4.2M which equates to 470K shares at $9.00 per share. The issuance of new stock dilutes the current shares outstanding while decreasing the EPS. This also creates negative sentiment and the stock begins to sell-off a bit. In addition, on both 8K‚Äôs they state:
‚ÄúThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for acquisition of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) equipment and raw materials to be used in connection with sale of tests used to diagnose infectious disease, including strains and mutations of coronavirus, as well as research and development costs associated with test development for additional pathogens and test menu expansion, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.‚Äù
 Moreover, you find $41K in Revenue for the Q and $147K for the full year. I believe a large portion of the newly raises capital will go towards working capital, primarily inventory. Replenishing inventory levels is key because you can‚Äôt generate revenue if have no inventory to sell. Below is an article on 3/5/2020 from Business Wire: 
Co-Diagnostics CEO Dwight Egan commented, ""We are already manufacturing and shipping coronavirus products to countries on 4 continents along with additional demand we are experiencing pursuant to the policy change. Recent customer purchases have also included diagnostic equipment to facilitate the availability of molecular diagnostics world-wide, specifically in connection to this global health crisis.‚Äù
This validated the statement on both 8K‚Äôs. While I do agree that CODX has room to run, I don‚Äôt think it touches its previous high of $21. The stock is not a long term play. I currently have no positions or derivative instruments on CODX. Good luck!",2020-03-09

U.S. Regional Biocontainment Lab to Begin Testing of Brilacidin Against Coronavirus (COVID-19) Next Week
 
WAKEFIELD, MA ‚Äì March 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, is pleased to inform shareholders that management has been advised testing of Brilacidin, the Company‚Äôs flagship defensin mimetic drug candidate, as a novel experimental treatment against the latest coronavirus is scheduled to commence at one of the 12 U.S. Regional Biocontainment Labs (RBLs) during the week of March 16, 2020.
 
Scientists at the RBL will be evaluating Brilacidin against SARS-CoV-2, the specific coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, the name given to the respiratory disease that has spread to 111 countries after being discovered in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. More than 114,000 cases of COVID-19 have since been diagnosed, with over 4,000 deaths attributed to the virus.
 
There are currently no countermeasures approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19. On Friday, March 6, President Donald Trump signed an emergency bill allocating $8.3 billion in funds to combat COVID-19.
 
Brilacidin is a compelling investigational drug for COVID-19 due to its unique qualities to mimic the human innate immune system and Mechanism of Action that includes disruption of the membrane of pathogens, leading to cell death. Throughout laboratory and clinical studies, Brilacidin has demonstrated potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and coverage against Gram-negative bacteria. Research supports the ability of Brilacidin to swiftly penetrate a peptidoglycan layer in these difficult bacteria, which is key to rapid pathogen destruction and decreases the likelihood of drug resistance emerging.
 
The ability to penetrate cell walls engenders confidence in this opportunity to meet an urgent medical need in treating coronaviruses like COVID-19. COVID-19 is an ‚Äúenveloped‚Äù virus, meaning it has a glycoprotein envelope surrounding its nucleocapsid. More succinctly, it has a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membranes studded with crown-like projections from which it is named.
 
The Company hopes to disclose the RBL‚Äôs research agenda for Brilacidin in the coming days. The upcoming research is being funded by third parties independent of Innovation Pharmaceuticals. The Company‚Äôs responsibility was only providing the Brilacidin and any requested data. The RBL now has the Brilacidin on site, as disclosed on Monday, March 9, 2020.
 
Penetrating the COVID-19 envelope could prove beneficial in designing a new drug or vaccine against the virus, although this would have to be confirmed through extensive laboratory and clinical research. No assurances are made or implied that testing will be successfully completed by the RBL or any other party.
 
As previously released, linked below (a downloadable pdf) is an overview document summarizing the scientific rationale for developing Brilacidin as a potential novel COVID-19 treatment, both as an intravenous medicine and as a vaccine.

I am in deep waters just like you. I don't know what effect this market will have on OGEN. It's certainly dampened the expected climb out that started before the market tanked. We hit .97 two weeks ago.

My reasoning is simply that a very conservatively estimated $750M a year drug isn't going to be ignored, in any market.

The news and catalysts are all lined up. They are well funded for P2. They have a one-of-a-kind drug. This drug is very much needed. The results are near. They have conferences as catalysts. They are not in danger of an rs before results. Insiders are buying. Institutions are buying. Analysts all agree. The company doesn't pump, they are very conservative with news. It's an artificially low price for entry. 

There is an [analyst we love to hate](https://s1.q4cdn.com/460208960/files/News/2020/Zacks_SCR_Research_03092020_OGEN_Bautz.pdf) because he treats OGEN like his whipping boy with absurdly low estimates like 5% of market penetration in a wide-open market and even he thinks $3 is around the corner.

If they rocket into the $3-$5 area, I'm probably out. I'll wait for a re-entry. The risk in that is if they get conditional approval or approval in the US or EU from P2 results since they are fast-tracked and orphan, I could miss the boat.",2020-03-09

Taking profit and never regretting it is key. There are new investments every day, even in a tanking market.

No matter what I think a stock *should* do, I use stop-losses and accept when the Market disagrees with me.

Avoid over-hyped stocks that have already moved. There are a LOT of those on this sub. I tried to point out the major flaws in IBIO after the initial move and got downvoted to oblivion. My posts were even reported to the mods. Now, I'm just going to quietly watch and offer up only my top picks.

They have no pipeline that isn't years away from bearing fruit. They will need a ton of money from investors or dilution to get anywhere.

It's the safest all-or-nothing play I know of right now, with HUGE upside potential, but it IS an all-or-nothing play.

The risk is why it's at .60. If they had a pipeline or products in the market, we wouldn't be able to get in. That's the world of bio-pennies.

So, yes, *for a bio-penny*, I consider it low risk. But all bio-pennies are risky. No matter how careful and experienced of a skydiver you are, the chute still may not open.",2020-03-09

I don‚Äôt know much about these types of situations, still learning, but seems like it could be an easy 25-50% if he exits before results.  Just something to think about.  Are you going to keep an eye on insiders as they approach results?

727,RamzFanz,fk5vqa8,/r/pennystocks/comments/fg1a4q/ogen_upcoming_catalysts_and_low_entry_price/fk5vqa8/,1,"Randal Kirk could be doing that, but I don't think so. 15% of the company is a TON of shares to unload on a runup unless it's substantial with a whole lot of volume. He also owns large pieces of a couple of other companies that are contractually tied to OGEN. If he drives down one, he harms them all.

My radar is telling me he could be positioning for a buyout. If he makes another substantial buy, I would be all but certain. No buyout would even be considered by OGEN under $3.50, I don't think, and $5 is not unreasonable.

HOWEVER, there are warrants that institutions own the rights to that can be exercised as this goes up. If they exercise them, at $.70, $.90 and $1.00, we will want to closely watch what they do with those shares. I would expect them to dump them for a profit before Randal Kirk would. If they do, it will be at $1.20 plus before they start, I would think.

If I catch a whiff of this happening, I will OP on this sub.

If I see it tank from $1.20ish area, I'm probably going to swing it.",2020-03-09
