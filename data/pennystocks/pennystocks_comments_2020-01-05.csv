I bought in WRR.V and expecting good returns in coming month. Nevada play with great historical results. More to come. What junior stocks are you into?",2020-01-05
94,AntiGenocider,fdfb5qp,/r/pennystocks/comments/ekhxda/resources_for_those_interested_in_penny_mining/fdfb5qp/,1,"WRR was on my watchlist . I was actually trying to buy it without paying 10 cents. If you like WRR, maybe have a look at SKP. Chart looks very similar. SKP-V is a silver/golden triangle exploration play.

I generally favor big ounce optionality companies like ME-T, MGM-V, DEF-V but do not limit myself to that. .I have about 4-5 dozen companies in total because big positions can be hard to buy or sell at times. I approach these markets like a grinch in a grocery store--if it is cheap and has real prospects, I will buy it. When it rises, I will sell some.",2020-01-05

I don't see any compelling event at the moment why the SP should go up in the short term but feel strong for the long term so have purchased 10 contracts exp 2021.",2020-01-05
