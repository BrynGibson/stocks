4,JackFlash19,e1s6xfm,/r/pennystocks/comments/8w038e/elite_pharmaceuticals_drug_approval/e1s6xfm/,1,"As a 16 yr pharmacy tech, another manufacturer of generic percocet isn't anything new. If anything any big chain is going to order the same manufacturer until the preferred prices them out or they can't supply enough. There are tons of manufacturers. Look at who they contract. 

Plus opiods prescribing is declining as Dr's are trying to write for fewer and fewer pills at a time. 

I don't know stocks that well, but I know how retail pharmacy orders drugs and this doesn't get me excited. ",2018-07-04

6,Kokid3g1,e1shd3w,/r/pennystocks/comments/8w038e/elite_pharmaceuticals_drug_approval/e1shd3w/,1,"That's not the reason why this approval is exciting. I'm not bashing you, but your missing the entire ELTP

Elite is one approval away from making (in house) abuse resistant opioids. So getting approvals for making different types of opioids is what Elite has currently been working on.

SequestOx has already been proven to work by the fda themselves. There was a Tmax issue, (how quickly the opioids are delivered into your body) and Elite has resolved this and currently awaiting the fda's approval.

Also, this is in no way the only round in the chamber.

Elite has several big hitters all awaiting approvals, all the while Elite is SEC compliant, no debt, and has revenues.

I'm not trying to sell Elite to anyone here. I'm long, and so not popular among flippers.

But I am very excited over this small company getting drugs approved by the fda. The process is long, costly, and a pain in the ass. It's definitely a milestone for smaller companies. ",2018-07-04

But I also think that cannabis-based pain relief is still leaps and bounds better. As more open to cannabis the country gets, fewer people will be looking toward NSAIDs... but not all that many. There will still be job-related and driving-related restrictions to cannabis, etc.
