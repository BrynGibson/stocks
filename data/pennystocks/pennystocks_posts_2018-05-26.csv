2,KemPharm is a drugs company combating opiate and ADHD stimulant abuse. Its pain control drug was approved last month while ADHD results were called “nothing short of exciting”. Its not hard to see how this could be a multibagger and the average target price is about twice Fridays close.,8mb7iy,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8mb7iy/kempharm_is_a_drugs_company_combating_opiate_and/,32,5,"Its ADHD drug alone should easily win $1bn to $2bn of share in a $25bn market if approved.  Which compares to a current market cap of less than $100 million.

Quite a lot of insider ownership.  Most recently last week EVP Daniel Cohen bought $50k on May 15th.

Some big companies like Facebook and Google have opted to just not provide their service to European clients instead of paying to become compliant. This is pissing people off and if lawsuits go down everyone will try to get compliant. Data 443(ldsr) provides that service so I expect it will countinue to go up, they are also expected to finally get their ticker symbol change too and I think that will also help the pps.

""Hello Mr. Walker.


I am curious about the Lease negotiations for the two Airbus A320's and whether a Lease may be signed in the near future. Do you have any news that you could share? 


I am very optimistic as are many other shareholders in Canada Jetlines and the appointment of  Mr. Lukas Johnson as CEO is further evidence that Jetlines will soon be taking off, literally and financially.


I thank you for your consideration.""

Here is his reply.


""Hi Rick,
 
We are expecting that the definitive agreement for the first two planes to be signed before the end of June and we expect a news release with details and timing shortly.
 
The addition of Lukas Johnson to the team is exceptional news, he left a lucrative career to take JET forward and the board and Wall St. both think the same.
 
Have a great weekend.""
