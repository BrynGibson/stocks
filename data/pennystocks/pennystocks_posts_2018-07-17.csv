FREMONT, Calif., July 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zosano Pharma (ZSAN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies that deliver rapid systemic absorption using a novel and proprietary technology called Adhesive Dermally-Applied Microarray (“ADAM™”) with the potential to transform patient lives and advance patient care, today announced the recent publication of a peer-reviewed paper regarding ADAM technology for the delivery of zolmitriptan in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Science.  

“This study enabled us to understand the delivery and tolerability of M207 in a nonclinical setting so as to aid us in setting reasonable expectations of our platform when studying in human subjects,” said Hayley Lewis, senior vice president, operations at Zosano Pharma. “The results from this animal study add to a growing body of evidence which indicate that absorption through the epidermis or dermis seems to be a suitable delivery platform for products that have limitations when delivered orally.”

In vivo studies were conducted in pigs using ADAM 1.9-mg zolmitriptan. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the ADAM 1.9-mg zolmitriptan was delivered with high efficiency (85%) and high absolute bioavailability (77%). Furthermore, in vivo evaluation showed a rapid systemic absorption with a median Tmax of 15 min. These results provided validation to advance the development of ADAM zolmitriptan.

About M207

M207 is our proprietary formulation of zolmitriptan delivered utilizing Zosano's proprietary ADAM technology.  Zosano's ADAM technology consists of titanium microprojections coated with drug, and in the case of M207, our formulation of zolmitriptan.  The drug-coated microneedles physically break through the stratum corneum and penetrate into the epidermis and dermis, where the dry drug coating is dissolved by the surrounding skin interstitial fluid.  In February 2017, the Company announced statistically significant results from the ZOTRIP pivotal study, which demonstrated that the 3.8mg dose of M207 met both co-primary endpoints, achieving pain freedom and most bothersome symptom freedom at 2 hours.  In November 2017, the Company announced the initiation of its long-term safety study evaluating M207 and expects to file an NDA for M207 in the fourth quarter of 2019.",2018-07-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8zlhc0/zsan_is_up_12_this_morning_on_the_following_news/

5,$JOR - Jourdan Resources - Canadian Lithium Jr,8zmjwy,smallcapsteve,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8zmjwy/jor_jourdan_resources_canadian_lithium_jr/,7,0," ""Back of the Napkin"", using the NAL dykes and what leads onto Vallee from 2011 drill results. I am happy to assume 3MT of lithium. Much of it near the surface. If you are inclined to price the stock based on the size of that resource you are looking at 25c-45c depending on the multiple you want to use (5-10x per MT). But the truth is, the cataylst will be much nicer: **Cashflows.**  


Under the small mine act, there should be enough lithum in Vallee to give us 3 years of production (2M MT/2000 MT per day = approx 1000 days). Thats without finding anything new. Which they will. And also a very conservative number on the back of the napkin.  


Why isn't this stock more promoted? Because they are still executing a pioneer type plan and acquiring more claims in the area. This tiny little nanocap, is actually building up a tremendous plan to generate cash flows and prove out a gigantic resource.  


For me personally, today's news indicates that the first time I talked to Michael on the phone in Feb 2018, everything he has said to me is accurate. When you look at the size of NAL's resource and what Sayona has on the other side. It is clear there are dykes running in the land Michael picked up. The guy is a former senior geologist with Goldcorp, he knows a thing or two.  


Anyways, you can sell because you aren't happy with the markets reaction. But the truth is, JOR doesn't care about promoting the stock yet. When the time is right, there will be a tour to around bay street and guess what? They will eat this story up. They are building out the Pilbara of Canada. With CATL's involvement next door, you can bet Bay Street will catch onto this story.  


Right now is like the seed round of financing. You get in and you make 10x your money or you get in and it doesn't work out very well. I'm betting heavy on Michael.  


I am sitting on the bid today. For two reasons, 1) everything Michael has said to me since the start has turned out to be true 2) the recent news that Sayona is making major strides in executing this plan a few kms over.
