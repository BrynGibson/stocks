We are pleased to announce our audited results for the year 2018,” stated Pulse CEO John Textor, “Such results reflect the completion of a transformational business combination, a dramatic step-up in acquired technology assets and net shareholder equity, and the completion of several corporate governance upgrades, as we prepare our platform to develop and roll-up the lucrative and sizeable digital human industry.”

Highlights of our 2018 Annual Report are as follows:

* Acquisition of substantially all of Evolution AI Corporation, a development stage artificial intelligence company, which included a 58% interest in Pulse Evolution Corporation, a globally recognized pioneer in the development of hyper-realistic digital humans;
* Total Assets of $286.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $86,000 for year ended December 31, 2017. Total Assets for year-end 2018 includes our third-party valuation of technology and other intangible assets of $136.2 million and $150.0 million of acquisition-related goodwill;   
* Total Stockholders’ Equity of $232.6 million, or $10.17 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a deficit of $3.1 million, or $(0.14) per share, for year ended December 31, 2017;           
* Net decrease in cash of $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised of cash used in operating activities of $3.15 million and cash proceeds from financing activities of $3.11 million;        

Highlights of our reported Subsequent Events are as follows:

* During the first quarter of 2019, the Company issued common shares to Tsang’s Group of Hong Kong in exchange for a cash investment of $1.1 million, at a purchase price of $11.28 per share. The Company has also granted to Tsang’s Group warrants to acquire an additional 200,000 common shares, subject to exercise prices of between $11.00 and $13.50 per share, or $11.31 on a weighted average basis, payable in cash only at any time prior to March 31, 2020.
* During the second quarter of 2019, the Company announced its investment and production company participation in Broadway Asia’s production of DreamWorks’ Kung Fu Panda Spectacular Live, a live theatrical show opening at the Venetian Theatre in Macau, Hong Kong in January 2020

“The year 2018 was certainly a remarkable and transformational year for our company,” commented Pulse Chairman Alexander Bafer, “We began 2017 as a promising virtual reality company with no global profile. We finished the year with a technology portfolio that leading entertainment companies have called the gold standard of human animation, well positioned to be a leader in the development and roll-up acquisition of the emerging global industry for digital human applications.”
