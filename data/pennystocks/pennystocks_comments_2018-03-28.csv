As a patient bottom feeder if I get a fill in the first place I'm lucky, if it falls a decent bit below my original buy in that's a blessing. That being said, before I ever average down I always reassess my original thinking to see if it still stands firm. I have very few losses in the penny space, but I also don't fill the majority of the buy orders I place. 

When a play I'm in is up 3x I will typically play both sides given how volatile penny stocks are. HCEI for example I entered at .0005, sold a few mill above .002 and have filled bids in the low teens since the most recent run. I've filled multiple 11 bids and also filled several sell orders at 22 and 19. This personally keeps me focused and constantly reanalyzing my plays without the risk of missing out on a big move since I hold onto my core position until what I'm waiting for comes to fruition (or doesn't).",2018-03-28

19,Fotivator,dwel0we,/r/pennystocks/comments/87nxc2/how_do_you_deal_with_your_loses/dwel0we/,1,"A rule of thumb for me is to look at the 52w performance. If the thing looks like a rollercoaster ride you can clearly see the stock is used for whats called short plays. Lets say a stock's 52w performance is 0.09-1.75 and the stock is currently at 1.45, unless you have insider information or see some massive piece of news before anyone else does, your best bet is to stay away from the stock until it goes back down to the 0.30-0.50 range. 

Now if the stocks 52w history looks like a steady (yet bumpy) uphill climb continuously, then those are the stocks you can usually invest in and go for a ""long play"" until you make your own investment back and then some. 

The only thing I can recommend is watch the ranges, get as close to the low as you can, and then sell as close to the high as possible. It sounds dumb and trivial, but you'd be surprised how many people don't even research the stocks performance for the year before just placing an order off of the day's price. Just remember, always have a buy number in your head and always have a sell number in your head. Don't be impatient and don't be greedy. These two mental notes have earned me quite a bit of money in my time day trading, Good luck.",2018-03-28
