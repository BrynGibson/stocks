0,UBER TECH = FERRARI ?,dzfw3f,sfitradingadvisor,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dzfw3f/uber_tech_ferrari/,1,1," 

Vi ricordate quando STARACE CEO ENEL compro' 100000 azioni ENEL a 4,69 e da li ENEL è arrivata a 7,09 ?  
Ieri CEO di UBER TECH ha comprato 250.000 azioni a 26,75  
quindi nel prezzo 27/28 di cui parliamo , ipotizzando per UBER TECH lo stesso andamento di FERRARI dopo il raggiungimento da 40 euro di area 27/28  
Attenzione a questa prova di ""fiducia"" nella propria azienda......

Look at the 1yr chart and see all the mini-pumps it’s had every few months. I think we will see one here. It ain’t gonna be a barn burner but could pick up 20-30% easily if it runs.
