PHOENIX, May 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – SinglePoint, Inc. (OTC:SING) announces the successful completion of the [Asset Purchase Agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lMdW_B_aB7LY3qzUSpEg2mQNSUKgX4EuzyMjHRTq9qUfhq8pQn6TeMos5Q1wk1kbVQHy3WSz0Dkxih0yXCYOwTjLgen_wNyq1ywDKlPk0hNyi7hsgpjkJcC0X9-yTDxIUG4VRhvBcstLvUmaiWg81Ot6H0xYzM7q6SlXgJkHzU0=) with [Direct Solar](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cFQIjSiyWQVV3yuU4UA9_mecOeK_UuXdgmVdQ-TLnAd6xJ2kODdUSO753tSYC57pKbnjGrMWWTgvw_6v9dRkMQ==) and AI Live Transfers dated Feb. 22, 2019. Direct Solar is the largest acquisition to date for SinglePoint and instantly puts the company squarely into the renewable energy markets. According to Hexa Research, the solar market is expected to reach $20.09 billion USD by 2025. Direct Solar provides a LendingTree/Rocket Mortgage way for customers to assess and purchase solar. This model allows for the company to scale quickly and efficiently throughout the United States and globally.  


“This acquisition will securely place SinglePoint on a new path towards growth, revenue and overall profitability. We believe Direct Solar has the people and ability to scale beyond initial projections and truly make an impact on SinglePoint’s goal of getting a NASDAQ or NYSE listing. We believe in the following 12 months from the date of the acquisition, revenues will be in the multiple millions along with profitability. This acquisition is a new opportunity and puts SinglePoint on a whole new trajectory path,” states Greg Lambrecht, CEO of SinglePoint.

“We are excited to officially be a part of SinglePoint. The access to growth capital will allow us to scale quickly and turn the processes we have built into revenue generating opportunities. We signed over $570,000 of contracts in April with very little marketing per sales budget. With the backing and support of SinglePoint, we believe we can exponentially increase our sales pipeline,” states Pablo Diaz, founder/CEO of Direct Solar. 

Recently, in an article posted by [CleanTechnica](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9gnKfy1CnD5hmPETavn3X5P0XPA_lj-T-lAHK43eB8OjvNYB3scdlPV_eSnSgH50Py1-uXjo4i4bjvsfD8wAYpcQLMWqpIX9eS4szBpHGgk4s6oWFDbOpF7Mp6GiaDJJIbk79e6of4HhoHfvoEl0cLH38JTVG4V2oynFFkMccaY=), Abigail Ross-Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), commented, “The rapid growth in the solar industry has completely reshaped the energy conversation in this country. This $17 billion industry is on track to double again in five years, and we believe that the 2020s will be the decade that solar becomes the dominant new form of energy generation.”

Direct Solar has seen tremendous growth over the past year, which aligns well with the industry overall. In Q4 2018, the U.S. solar market installed 4.2 GWdc of solar PV, a 139% increase from Q3 2018 and a 4% increase from Q4 2017. This is attributed to environmental awareness and the overall cost of solar becoming affordable for customers.

Solar is a massive opportunity both locally and globally. Locally, the concept of community solar panel systems is gaining popularity in the U.S., and globally, the market is expected to reach 100 gigawatts.

Above and beyond residential solar, SinglePoint has been in discussions and contact with companies that are interested in utilizing solar to increase power efficiencies for their cannabis cultivation. SinglePoint believes there is a major opportunity to marry cannabis and solar to help decrease costs and decrease the overall energy-intensiveness of indoor cannabis cultivation.",2019-05-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bol2kl/sing_singlepoint_completes_asset_purchase/

CAMPBELL, Calif., May 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG), (the “Company” or “KULR”), today announced it will provide its space-developed thermal technology for a purpose-built phase change (PCM) heat sink to leading aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).

The PCM developed by KULR delivers concentrated heat capacity from phase change, utilizing the company’s proprietary carbon fiber core to provide tailored thermal conductivity and proven durability in a light-weight package.  The PCM device may serve as a structural element in the system and either absorb or release heat according to the application.  This fully passive device offers a cost-effective alternative to more complex cooling methodologies. 

Details on how Lockheed Martin will use the customized PCM heat sinks was not disclosed, nor were specific terms of the agreement. Company leaders did highlight the importance of their partnership in developing and using the best thermal management technologies for crucial aerospace, defense and other systems.

“In nearly every advanced technology, heat is a killer. And the more advanced, the more precise something has to be, the more important it is to isolate and redirect heat away from the source – and that’s what we do,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR. “We are very proud to be working with Lockheed Martin to design and deliver thermal management solutions to their demanding specifications – solutions that allow Lockheed Martin to meet and exceed the needs of their customers,” he said.

KULR’s PCM solutions are expected to be delivered through 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

**Integrated Ventures Inc.** ([OTCQB: INTV](https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=quote&amp;symbol=INTV)), a company that engages in digital currency mining operations through manufacturing equipment; selling mining rigs, as well as developing blockchain software, [recently announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integrated-ventures-signs-multi-hosting-133500144.html) the signing of a Hosting and Marketing Agreement with PetaWatt Properties, LLC. As a result, the previously contemplated transaction to acquire Erie Power, LLC has been terminated, (1) due to a need for significant capital requirements to re-start the plant and build out mining infrastructure, (2) up to a 6 month timeline for launch of mining operations, (3) a need for a significant dilution due to the recent stock pricing weakness and (4) the company's ability to secure a similar deal, in terms of power cost, without any additional investment.  
On May 7, 2019, Integrated Ventures signed a three-year Agreement with PetaWatt Properties, LLC, which will allow Integrated Ventures to consolidate and streamline all mining operations (NC, PA and NJ) into one location, to eliminate the Company's lease obligations and payroll expenses and to lower its power costs by over 50%, thus greatly enhancing mining profitability and long-term viability.  
In addition, Integrated Ventures intends to market PW's services to diversify its business by offering hosting and pool services via a la carte packages to third-party miners and market participants.  
The company has formulated and plans to execute a 6 step plan, designed to position INTV for the next bull cycle:

1. **Operational Restructuring.** To streamline and improve profitability of current operations, the company is switching from warehouse mining to third party hosting model, based on monthly flat fee and resulting in elimination of all major expenses such monthly lease, payroll, etc. All mining equipment (775+ rigs) is scheduled to be connected by May 30th.
2. **Securing Competitive Electricity Rates.** By partnering with PetaWatt, Integrated Ventures will secure access to a lowest power pricing structure.
3. **Generating Cash Flow via Hosting &amp; Mining Revenue Share Services.** Integrated Ventures intends to generate significant revenue through reselling of hosting and revenue share services.
4. **Locking-In Record Low Hosting Rate.** Newly secured Integrated Ventures' access to the most competitive power cost, will allow the company to utilize and market one of the most competitive hosting rates in the industry, thus driving profitability and demand for long-term hosting contracts.
5. **Implementing All-In-One ""Plug-and-Mine"" Mining Solution.** Integrated Ventures will offer clients an access to best hosting and pool rates for ASIC and GPU miners, creating a ""We Work"" -style turn-key mining option for miners seeking a fast market entry combined with a cost effective hosting and pool space.
6. **Purchasing Discounted Mining Rigs from Secondary Markets.** Integrated Ventures will keep costs low by purchasing equipment on the secondary market, a strategy that was not possible when the market was in its infancy.

Integrated Ventures will have reliable long-term access to inexpensive electricity through its three-year agreement with PetaWatt. Access to the low cost power is the key that will allow Integrated Ventures to mine far more profitably than most of its North American competitors and provide hosting services at the market's most competitive price point.",2019-05-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bolnqw/intv_gains_in_bitcoin_reignite_crypto_fever/
