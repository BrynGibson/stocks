21,Derp2638,ecoghmc,/r/pennystocks/comments/aa1y8u/bravatek_reverse_split/ecoghmc/,1,Sure I’ll explain it for ya. A reverse split normally happens when a company must meet its requirements to stay on the Nasdaq when its price is under 1$. So for example a 3 for 1 reverse split at the price at 50 cents will change the stock price to 1.50$. If you owned 900 shares before the split you now own 300 at 1.50 instead of 900 at 50 cents.  If they don’t meet the requirements to stay on the Nasdaq the company gets delisted and moves down to otc and less people will be able to buy shares from it. Occasionally a reverse split will be good see HEAR turtle beach company from last May. But normally a reverse split is a big negative. ,2018-12-27

They've got a lot of big players working in their company, and they have a lot of powerful political ties worldwide.

The stock would be at $4 right now, if it wasn't for the crazy market. 

It's a bargain at under a dollar. 

When drones start to fly in Canada, this country should have a monopoly over it.

When drones  start to fly in America, this company would have an advantage due to the weak Canadian dollar, and the business ties within the company. 

American companies can focus on military, and this company can focus on consumer and medical.

My personal favorite is parcelpal, though. 

Already got a deal with Amazon, and I can literally have a full-time job delivering parcels with them.

For anyone who makes a living on uber, you should buy some parcelpal stock, and start working with them too. Double your income, and become an owner.

Yes, yes I am. I play the real big boy market so yes I follow quite closely. You cant just pick a random point in time and say but it's up 800%! Lol.. you forget it was still being traded prior to 2015? Did you forget it was valued at $3.20 at the beginning of its publicly traded life? Would you like me to do the math for you on that? It's -49%..all time.. yeah.. I bet the inital investors are just thrilled with its performance. Also, learn how to math.. it's not up 800%. Its up 757% since its ATL which for the record was 2 years ago on 2016.  You do also understand why the company has been going up under a trump presidency dont you? Do you expect that to continue when he leaves office? Doubtful. 

Overall I'm not saying the company is going to zero, if that were the case I'd be shorting the hell out of it. What I am saying is it's not the best looking stock to give buy recommendations on, there are many many other better looking positions to take. ",2018-12-27

Then you proceed to critisize my math (which I was so obviously rounding) by nitpicking the precise percentage. Except while you’re telling me to learn math, you have the **wrong** actual percentage that it’s up from the lows, now that’s amazing. Not to mention my friend didn’t buy at the all time so you’re still wrong about that anyway lol.
