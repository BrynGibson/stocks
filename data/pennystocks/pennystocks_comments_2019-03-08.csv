It's my understanding that nlst has a strong claim and Google will lose if they appeal, but I still expect them to drag it out as long as possible. So that would give them to sometime in 2021. If they do that it will be triple damages though. My bet is they are looking at how the hynix case goes before doing anything. I don't expect anything to happen before April at the earliest. I belive netlist has a 60/70% chance against hynix, so I will wait for it to drop back into the 40th before adding more.

Once people stop selling thier shares, short sellers start losing. That to me partly explains the recent mega dip back below 0.004. The other half of that dip was just people cashing out from 0.003 to 0.007 and again cashing out as the dip was occuring to save profit.   
Now with this news, i think short sellers are going to stay away and now its bull time. Once the stock surpasses 0.95, people are going to start cashing out. In fact I think people will start doing that well before, and then after the mass cashout, i think the shortsellers will leach back in. 

I'm really only learning the markets and it's been a few weeks for me so far, so if anyone wants to correct me or offer different insight please do.

I got onboard with over 100000 shares at 0.0035. If the price goes up to 0.05, i stand to make nice cash. The rest of you with over a million shares, you guys are goooood.

I don't think it's necessarily scammy.  There was a screenshot of an email yesterday from LEAS investor relations, stating Bolbat is just the interim CEO.  Once the company merges their President/CEO and management is taking over.  

So what I get out of this is Bolbat is trying to get himself in the business of reverse mergers alone, not actually running any companies.  He looks for defunct shells that are sub penny, gets them current, then brokers a deal with a private company looking to avoid an IPO and go through a reverse merger.  LEAS seems to be his first attempt, so there's risk there, but if he's successful here, I'll definitely be watching BBDA and any other similar deals he does in the future.

Reading on past posts it appears many of you still expect a bit of a run on this?

If said merger succeeds, couldn't the stock continue to go up? Or expected to dissolve the company and force sale of shares or does it just tank?

Basically lurking and ready to throw a few grand at gambling on something other than poker tournaments...
