The merger was completed in September 2018 once the audit requirement was satisfied; however, the Secretary of State of California did not process the finalization of the merger of Sonasoft Corp and Cornerstone Technologies until January 15, 2019. Therefore, the accounting books of each company were filed separately for fiscal year 2018.

The Company also completed a two-year audit for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 by ThayerONeal, Certified Public Accountants. The Company‚Äôs full audit report is available to review on OTC Markets under the profile for Sonasoft Corp (SSFT):¬†

The Company continues its integration with Cornerstone Technologies and Hotify, Inc.¬† The anticipated synergies from these acquisitions and mergers have resulted in tangible results that will positively impact the Company‚Äôs top-line revenue and bottom-line earnings.¬† For instance, the Company has been able to utilize Cornerstone Technologies‚Äô solid enterprise client base to create new opportunities to install Sonasoft‚Äôs software solutions, which includes intellectual property (IP) fully owned by the Company. ¬†This business model has not only led the Company to displace competing solutions with SonaVault Enterprise Information Archiving (EIA) Software Solution but has allowed the Company‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) platform to be introduced to the Company‚Äôs legacy enterprise clients.

‚ÄúSonasoft and Cornerstone Technologies have collectively exceeded $11.4 million, and we are energized to see our performance as we go forward,‚Äù said Frank Velasquez, CEO of Sonasoft. ‚ÄúThe synergies from the combined Company have already delivered impressive results.¬† Instead of Cornerstone only selling third-party solutions, we can now offer our own IP.¬† For instance, as a result of the merger, we were able to win a notable contract for our SonaVault Enterprise Information Archiving Software Solution with the San Jose Sharks hockey team by displacing a major competing solution.¬† Other business deals are in the works, which include our recently revitalized SonaSQL Backup, Recovery, and Replication Software Solution. The Company has also expanded its signature software solution to archive over forty data points including social media platforms, cloud-based file sharing sites, and chat apps like Twitter, Facebook, Skype, SharePoint, OneDrive, ShareFile, Jabber, Slack, Yammer, and more.¬† Sonasoft‚Äôs archive solutions have expanded beyond email and are poised perfectly to capture business in the high-value enterprise space.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost exciting is the potential of our artificial intelligence (AI) platform, NuGene,‚Äù continued Frank Velasquez.¬† ‚ÄúWe have earned several proof of concepts (PoC‚Äôs) with our existing enterprise customers as well as some of the biggest names in the tech sector this year. Details will be announced when appropriate to do so. We anticipate that 2019 will be a year for many marquee wins for the company.‚Äù¬†
