I‚Äôve heard free trade is good too. Trading 212 also allows you to create a dummy account so you can practice your higher risk guesses with fake money. I believe they make their money from users paying for add ons and a slightly larger spread (but this won‚Äôt be an issue unless you‚Äôre trading in the 10s thousands each time). 

The catch with the commission free platforms  is that you can only buy the bigger more common stocks so doesn‚Äôt have penny stocks or LSE AIM. It also mainly focuses on UK/US share markets but that‚Äôs all I want for now.

Other low cost platforms include Degiro - they have some fees but a much bigger range of instruments and markets accessible. I tried opening an account 2 weeks ago but they were so oversubscribed they weren‚Äôt creating any new accounts at that point

Hargreaves Lansdown are very well rated - I used this for any penny stocks but you need to have more money in to make profit as it‚Äôs got ¬£11 fees for each trade (buy/sell). But they have a large range of funds available as well as a well rated customer service.

MEOW is doing good but you want to set a stop loss just in case.

So a stop limit order sells the stock if it falls in a price range you set.

From my experience, if I know my entry point is relatively solid I won‚Äôt set a stop loss until the price starts moving up significantly / sporadically - this is to prevent the situation I described above. Price fluctuation happens, so if I‚Äôm very confident that eventually the price is going to go up from my entry point, I will hold off on putting in a stop loss in until I have at least locked in some profit.

Now, if I‚Äôm trading hyped up, TO THE MOON penny blasters, I move my stop loss up with the price action. I typically set it at the last level of support just to give it some room. If you set it higher you might miss a rebound - yes, you might miss out on potential profit but I once read that no one ever went broke while making profits.

Although, sometimes when trading off of hype/news it can be hard to determine the latest true support level because the SP is increasing so dramatically... in this case, I just pick a stop loss price that I feel comfortable with and that I know will get me at least some profit. 

Side note - news related stop losses don‚Äôt fill half the time, so when I‚Äôm trading off of strictly news I have a tighter stop loss, in theory getting out BEFORE the SP crosses the point where there are no more buyers left.

Don‚Äôt always settle for a stop loss sell though! Sometimes, have a stop loss set but realize that a market/limit sell is better because it‚Äôs just spiked too much to the point where it probably won‚Äôt go higher. 

Lastly, 99% of traders have probably gotten f***** from not having a stop loss... it happens. Learn from your mistakes, and get back out there because there will always be another opportunity!

However you neglected to mention that a R/S is not likely to happen before the shareholder meeting in June. The authority to implement a R/S is to be voted on by the shareholders.

There are a few more risks as well. Offerings for example.

There are also likely short term catalysts that will launch this security through the roof.

Either way solid job on the video!

Hololens 2
https://www.kguttag.com/2019/10/10/hololens-2-video-with-microvision-easter-egg-plus-some-hololens-and-magic-leap-rumors/

Note.  Author Karl Guttag is a long time MVIS critic who insisted that MEMS LBS would never be used in Augumented Reality (AR).  After years of saying it was impossible, he conceded MSFT used MVIS in Hololens 2 but then went on to criticize MSFT.  See the video in the comments section of the article where MSFT's Zulfi Alam explains why MSFT decided to use MEMS LBS in Hololens 2 (and future Hololens products.)

Some oldies just for fun:

Note how brightness and resolution have increased over the years.  For example, the videos below are at WVGA (848 x 480 resolution) = 407,070 pixels.

The 720p projectors above come in 2 resolutions:  the standard 1280 x 720 = 921,600 pixels and an unusual resolution of 1920 x 720 = 1,382,400 pixels employed in 2014 in the PicoBit and Sony MCL developed in 2021-13 by MVIS for Sony.  Sony never released the product broadly.

MVIS' new 2 mirror MEMS has 1440p resolution which translates to approximately 3.5 million pixels, a giant leap from the original 407K.

* if a stock opens with a big gap down, another big loss (mitigate by checking pre-market and canceling your order and/or hope for a rebound)
* if a stock gyrates wildly, your stop loss will execute at a not so favorable price (CDEV as an example before this week)
* sometimes your broker cancels your stop loss order or it expires, making you a bagholder  (happened to me with OPK)

The profit in Q3 is primarily related to the change in value of derivative liability. Their growth does look good, but the gross profit margin doesn't. Cogs/revenue increased from 60% to 75% Q3 2018 - Q3 2019. 

The working capital is being skewed by the current portion of the note payable fair, but their cash position isn't great and unless I'm reading this wrong only half of the debt is convertible? 

They also have a large accumulated deficit and their going concern note doesn't stand out as very compelling "" The Company has incurred losses since inception and had accumulated a deficit of $29,774,346 as of September 30, 2019..... The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. ""

675,arch1inc,fpbae79,/r/pennystocks/comments/gcdtct/alpp_going_to_run_on_revenue_report/fpbae79/,1,"Yes for 9 months they still had a loss overall, but im hoping year end they pulled it back to positive. That Q3 was the first positive Q in a long time. I‚Äôm not seeing a noticable difference with the derivative liabilities from 2019 to 2018 could you further explain, might be looking at different thing. I can tell you a big reason for the net difference is ‚Äògain from extinguishment of debt‚Äô and we should see that continue contuining on now. 

Working capital always seems to be a little low because they aquire companies fairly regular as well, 2 in 2019. They have signed an investment bank deal for an extra cash option if needed.

To address the incurred losses per operation. It is actually relatively small considering the company has been active for 7 years. Compared to most big board stocks and other OTC‚Äôs this loss is very small, and their revs are even expected to be greater than it this year. Every company starts somewhere and especially with the OTC it can be hard to get a start without taking on a large loss. I hope the companies progress shows through in the coming years. The statement is for legal purposes of course every stock has it. Heck take a look at the most recent NYSE NASDAQ uplists S-1‚Äôs. They all have the same language with even bigger incurred losses. 

Glad to have you watching! Definitely keep an eye on them in the coming year. Thanks for the response",2020-05-02

Bought the stock because I agree with you. This software is huge in Asia as it simplifies body temperature checking. I personally believe that we‚Äôll start seeing this kind of checks more and more in the rest of the world, as large companies will probably use it to prevent spreading between employees. I for example work for a company that had to close a large factory plant last week because two people were tested positive. Its now open again as no one else working at the factory showed symptoms in the last few days.  Remark‚Äôs software could really help these kind of operations. Closing a factory plant for a whole week causes serious costs. 

Also think about critical operations where its really hard to keep 1.5m distance (public transportation, medical visits). It becomes easier for governments to reopen these operations when some kind of control is in place. 

Watch some videos of their software in practice. It looks amazing... although I have to say I have some concerns about its impact on privacy regulations, as I expect a lot more complaints from the public in non-asian countries.

I will pass. 

Lets take the 10Q for 9 months ending Sep 2019...

With $1.7mm in operating profit, the company amazingly shows a $3.5mm net profit, through the change in the VALUE of a derivative instrument. 

Nothing to worry about there. I should probably take a home equity and go long. 

Also, love how the company had to shell out over $100k in cash flow to continue operations.

1) Negative cash flows
2) Incoherent business model
3) Showboat supposed 'Covid 19' contracts in press releases. 
4) Paper profits generated by the value of a derivatives position. 
5) Company deals, among many unusual segments, in auto showroom software?

They'd rather store finished oils and solvents since that's what their storage is set up and segregated for. Producers are having to get creative with their customers, too. Take product on consignment just to offload storage capacity.

I turned about $5k into $10k. Then Covid hit and that pattern became utterly useless. So I joined this sub to hopefully learn new ideas.

‚ÄúCELEBRATION, Fla., March 02, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KemPharm, Inc. (Nasdaq: KMPH), a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs, today announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for its investigational product candidate, KP415, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  KP415 is KemPharm‚Äôs product candidate for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which contains serdexmethylphenidate (SDX), KemPharm‚Äôs prodrug of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH). 

Initially, the FDA will review the data package and, if deemed to be complete, will issue formal notice of acceptance of the submission, a process which typically takes sixty (60) days from the date of submission.  Since KP415 contains SDX, which is a new molecular entity (NME), the FDA review guidance for NMEs is ten (10) months from the date of acceptance, which could lead to a potential action (PDUFA) date in March 2021.‚Äù",2020-05-02

It's derisked quite a bit in recent years with enormous potential both this year and going forward.  CEO keeps buying shares.

Revenue in 2018 was $1.35 million.


Revenue 2019 was $6.09 million with a target of $5.3.


Revenue target for 2020 is $10.6 million.


At some point Verde's proven and probable mineral reserves need to be accounted into the companies share price. They have 777million tonnes of proven and probable reserves which they mine for $26/tonne and sell for $50/tonne, that's making $24 profit off every tonne.


What should those reserves be valued at? $1/tonne in the ground? They company has about ~50million shares fully diluted and a market cap of ~$20million.
With current market cap those 777million tonne of reserves are valued at 2 cents a tonne, which is ridiculous when each tonne sells for $24 profit. Brazil is the largest importer of fertilizer in the world, which is a huge transportation cost. Verde is a local company with relatively cheap shipping costs. The company could be bought out in a heart beat at this price for what they own and are able to sell.


The day those reserves are given a fair value, even a low one of $1/tonne I'm laughing. 777 tonne at $1/tonne with 50million shares out is $15/share. I think that's why the company used to be $14/share based only on reserves and not a single sale, but then the market said prove you can sell those reserves, until you do we aren't valuing them. Well Verde is proving the fertilizer sells, they're most definitely proving the fertilizer sells.


Those lotto numbers are going to play one day. I hope it's this year.",2020-05-02
