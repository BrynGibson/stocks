My plan is not to use that much money in Pennystocks because of its volatility and shady nature. I am comfortable with risking up to $300 on a Pennystock with a goal of making between 25-35% on the stock before commission. That $300 would get re-used and the surplus would go towards longer term holdings. That way I can better protect my portfolio while still having the ability to generate capital. That was my thought anyway. ,2018-11-13
