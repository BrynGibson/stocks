2,PaperPusherRobot,dvhtip8,/r/pennystocks/comments/83h23o/mythical_fda_approval_dates/dvhtip8/,1,"I've only researched a handful of FDA catalysts, but this is how I think it works:

The FDA gives themselves a certain number of months to process an application, and they return their decision privately to the applying company. It is then up to the applying company to disclose the decision via a press release, which can be a summary of the FDA's response. This is why there are no hard dates with the FDA.

In the case of JAGX's ""Use of Canalevia for Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Diarrhea in Dogs"", it is a ""Minor Use/Minor Species"" designation of a drug that's already been approved by the FDA to treat HIV Associated Diarrhea.

JAGX has completed 2 of 4 technical sections of their application for conditional approval of that usage, disclosed in this press release:

https://www.accesswire.com/492257/FDA-Indicates-that-Jaguars-Reasonable-Expectation-of-Effectiveness-Technical-Section-is-Complete-for-Use-of-Canalevia-for-Treatment-of-Chemotherapy-Induced-Diarrhea-in-Dogs

It also has this forward-looking statement to let investors know how much longer it will take to get approval if the remaining steps are completed without delay:

""With receipt of conditional approval for this indication, we would expect to conduct the commercial launch of Canalevia‚Ñ¢ for CID in dogs in mid-2019""

The FDA site lists Canalevia here, with no status:
