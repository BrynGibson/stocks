They have 22 million cash on hand and that’s enough for three quarters because they burn 8 million a quarter. 

The company also only recorded 50,000 in revenue.  Unless there’s something else I don’t know about or a big partnership that’s been hinting at I’d stay away.  Now if you told me that they made 4 million last quarter in revenue and were growing but still had 4 million a quarter in burn I’d say go for it. However, I don’t see it right now.",2019-11-23

I wanna know that a company has enough money that they aren’t thinking about diluting. I want to know if they are improving. I also want to know how much money they are in debt and what short term and long term catalyst they have. 

A good example of this SMRT or stein mart. Currently I’m down 10-15% and right now it’s at 70 cents but they are improving. They have ton of money in debt but recently added a kids section and a high end jewelry section to their stores. They said next quarter the cash burn would be lower compared to cash burn of the previous year. Sure buying would be a long 3 month play right now but I could 3 or 4x my money if it’s a good ER. Which I think the upcoming quarter will be really good. The company might have 150 million in debt right now or 160 but the market cap of the company is 39 million ish right now with only 44 million shares in the float and their inventory on hand is worth 300 million. It’s a pure value play.",2019-11-23
