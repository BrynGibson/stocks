Which is normal for the first few days. Next day the new symbol AXXA was up and trading, but it turns out ALL the shares are being borrowed because the originals haven't been released. So basically the thing is going absolutely bananas cus there are no shares. Might be worth buying in and holding until the old TLNUF shares are released, and then I expect it to correct but until then its gonna go bonkers. Like... it was a penny yesterday and today it's pushing 6 cents! I'm talking OWCP type event here, is it gonna crash eventually? For sure but until then skys the limit.

15,"$AKER Update - Executive Chairman terminated, stock trending upwards",8f5c1y,itzjamesftw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8f5c1y/aker_update_executive_chairman_terminated_stock/,7,6,"I see $AKER talked about here frequently, but I haven't seen anyone talking about the major news of last night. It has yet to be PR'd, but here is a recap:

The Board of Directors voted to terminate Raymond Akers (!) as the Executive Chairman. Richard Carlyte Tarbox was named the interim non-executive chairman. 

Tarbox was formerly the CEO at Alverix when it was bought out.

Upon news of this, the ticker was halted in After Hours and dropped from .48 to .43, before quickly bouncing back to .52. Again, this was just AH, so speculation is whatever there.

Today the Stock opened at .520 and is currently at .548

This is not a pump. This is just an information share.

Though, as an investor, it seems strange that a board of directors would essentially make a ""hostile"" take over move. But then again, since Akers is staying with the company in a new role, how hostile could of it been?  But the fact that Tarbox has worked with acquisitions and mergers before might be the perfect buy the rumor sell the news move.

All I know is the general consensus is that this was a good move for the company and the price is up on it. This is a ticker that was red for nearly two straight weeks, so either it is being pumped back on speculation, or maybe this new Chairman move was made for a specific rumor.

Hopefully the AKER team will PR this, I believe I saw that a StockTwits poster contacted AKER and they said their PR director was out of office until April 30th. That seems incredibly odd to me, but we could be set up for a Friday pump into Monday pre-market news.

Tread lightly, but keep an eye on it.",2018-04-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8f5c1y/aker_update_executive_chairman_terminated_stock/
