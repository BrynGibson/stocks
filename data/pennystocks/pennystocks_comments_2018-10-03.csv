I would make sure you can trade OTC before doing any due diligence. Once I see OTC I go no further

Looking at this stock I would say it is a non starter. A lot of the good news for weed came out the past couple of days with the DEA down grading weed in the US and Canada legalizing it for recreational use. I rode the wave and made a lot of money on IGC but that stock is tumbling since I sold. This stock seems like it gains and loses a penny at a time with little promise of any substantial gains. As a long term investment I would say yes because Canada made weed legal and this company is HQed in Toronto. If your'e looking for a good penny stock that will explode for a quick short term gain I would recommend looking elsewhere.

There are only two industries that have proven track records with penny stocks: biotech and speculative mining (oil and gas mostly). 

Research is hard because if there was information to be had, people would know and the price would go up. You’re basically taking the upside risk of not knowing a future event. How a patent will play out etc. 

Your best bet is to use stock screeners ie technical and not fundamental analysis. Pick an industry you believe has future potential (previous winners: crypto, legal cannabis) and follow the numbers. You’re gonna lose a lot so don’t bet the house on one, but spread across. You can take 9 losses if your last one 10x’s. 

But from a more logical standpoint ask yourself this; if this stock is going to blow up, why hasn’t it already? If you feel you know the answer and feel you think the risk is lower than the market does, buy in. Statistically speaking you’re gonna fail though",2018-10-03

Wall street overreacted to the FDA approval and it seems like many do not understand what they're investing in (i.e. they think the drug is too toxic or the company won't be able to generate enough revenue). Duvelisib is relatively toxic but the alternative is either: a) Zydelig which is even more toxic and has to be intravenously infused with Rituxan (compared to Duvelisib which is an oral monotherapy) or b) death. Verastem only needs like $50 mil in revenue to justify its current evaluation but it could easily bring in $200+ mil. ,2018-10-03
