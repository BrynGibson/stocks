This stock is insultingly undervalued at this level and I consider anything under .30 to be a fantastic entry.

Looking through the news year over the past year it is clear to see that this is NOT our average penny stock. They are a real business in one of the fastest growing industries (AI) and regularly get contracts from big name companies such as San Jose Sharks, Exterro, Golden Gate Bridge, and also companies on the Fortune 500 and 1000 lists.
