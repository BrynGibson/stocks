These pumpers and the employees of JT Marlin might as well be the exact same people with how they sell you on this new penny stock. 

The point is, if you‚Äôre looking to actually make money... invest in real credible companies and don‚Äôt throw any money at these good for nothing penny stocks because if you don‚Äôt lose your money the first time, you‚Äôll surely lose it soon afterwards.",2019-08-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cmploi/simple_disclaimer/

Mr. William Ying reports

BENCHMARK BOTANICS RECEIVES CANNABIS SALES LICENSE FROM HEALTH CANADA

Benchmark Botanics Inc.'s 100-per-cent-owned subsidiary, Potanicals Green Growers Inc., has received a sales licence from Health Canada, effective July 26, 2019.

The licence allows Benchmark to supply and sell finished cannabis products to provincial governments throughout Canada and through Canada's distribution and retail supply chain. Benchmark will be providing recreational and medical dried cannabis, capsules and other forms of cannabis products as the government of Canada makes more forms of the product legal for sale and consumption later this year.

""Receiving the Health Canada sales licence is of significant importance and signals a giant step forward for the growth of Benchmark,"" commented William Ying, chief executive officer of Benchmark Botanics. ""The sales licence gives the company the ability to sell additional products and is very timely with the new legalization for the edible market soon upon us. Our sales licence will allow us to enter the Canadian medical and recreational marketplaces, as well as fulfill potential international supply agreements.""

Along with the recent approvals for the Zhejiang Yatai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. joint venture, receiving the sales licence represents another key milestone in Benchmark's path toward becoming one of global leaders in the development and commercialization of cannabis and cannabis-derived products designed to support health and wellness. Since late 2017, Benchmark has secured all regulatory approvals required to harvest and sell cannabis, which has contributed to the continuing growth and enhancement of the business.

Look at the comparative share structures and starting prices. I think over the next couple weeks, $DMAN will be over .10 - I know thats crazy, but look at the share structure and chart. Its identical to $DCGD before its big run.
