I'm currently talking about FCEL, but just any pennystock in general. How do you deal with it after doing your homework and deciding that this one isnt for you, just for it to substantially jump a few days later? I'm not saying like it is on the forefront of my mind or anything but every once in a while it pops back in my head, especially when looking at other potential buys and kinda seeing the same thing, everyone talking down on it, no recent positive news, etc... New to trading stocks, but I can already see this as something that could potential cause me to make the wrong decision in the future.",2019-12-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ehxrmx/does_anyone_else/

This morning, it hit $5.94 (440% profit on my remaining 10% of shares) and I'm wondering if I should have sold.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask those of you that hold shares for parabolic growth: what percentage are you looking for? 

200%?

500%?

1,000%?

Just sell when it feels right?",2019-12-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ei4fqy/at_what_point_do_you_sell_on_stock_you_held_in/

8,"$MILV Biotech Merger -- ""Brain Trauma Preventative Liposome Compound""",ei3jc9,FlipMovieScript,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ei3jc9/milv_biotech_merger_brain_trauma_preventative/,1,12,"Good Morning Redditers! \*\*Attention\*\* -- Serious Biotech Merger occurring in the OTC right now. $MILV is merging with CCA, LLC. Please read below to get a VERY shortened version of what is going on:  


1. In late October, the custodian, **Joseph Passaqulua** had a shareholder letter that went out to an older shareholder list.

In this, it stated that this company called **""Compelling Competitive Advantage LLC (CCA LLC)"" would merge with MILV**.  


2. That CCA LLC had an open contract with **University of Pennsylvania and Childrens Hospital of Philly**

Interestingly enough, a bunch of us needed to know more about this company and so the digging began.

We found an old company by the name of Endeavor IP (more recently NanoLife Health) was 90% owned by CCA. **The major shareholders of the company were listed:**  


1. **James B. Hovis** (sold multiple drinking lines e.g. AQUISS Beverage to Egg. Co)
2.   
**Edward J. Mathias** (Senior Adviser to one of the WORLDS largest investment firms -- The Carlyle Group -- Assets $211 billion **AND AND AND A TRUSTER EMERITUS for University of Penn**... interesting)
3.   
**Michael W. Fountain** \-- **(microbiologist in liposome research ""a vehicle compound"", has 181 products, 131 international and domestic patents, sold a company for $575 million The Liposome Company) to Elan Corp.)**
4.   
**Larry Kubin** (Two time superbowl champion with Washington Redskins and advocate and spokesperson for traumatic brain injury)
5.   
**Stuart Yarbrough** (Crosshill Financial Group -- takes startups and gives them the money to build a successful company and makes them look good for big company acquisitions).  


What this means is that you have a lot of successful people and big names coming together to build a BIOTECH company to utilize MICHAEL W. FOUNTAINs patents for brain trauma therapy, recovery, prevention/  


&gt;**\*\*\*\*\*He developed a carrier drug (liposome) that can pass through the BBB - Blood Brain Barrier and deliver highly targeted drugs to neurons prior to neuronal necrosis\*\*\*\*\***

9,Wireless Internet Problem in Rural USA Solved ?,ei6von,SureSpeech5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ei6von/wireless_internet_problem_in_rural_usa_solved/,1,3,"  

A Microsoft survey in 2019 estimated **160 million rural residents do not have access to broadband internet.**

**30 million rural residents have ""****no""** **access to the internet.**

Ruralink Wireless is using TV White Space technology to enhance network broadband capacity and efficiency. Working with Ark Multicasting who own 283 TV stations with 130 stations in rural US.

The Ruralink Wireless network will be fastest (25MB/sec) and cheapest (US$25 per month) internet provider in all of its markets.

Its first wireless broadband network is under construction in Crockett, Texas 

Will this company solve the problem that has plagued the country fold for years ?

 

""… my download speed is crawling along at 0.61 Mbps. Five hours later, at 4:21 p.m., it's only 2.12 Mbps.”

   
 

“ By the Federal Communications Commission's latest estimate, which uses figures from 2016, 24 million Americans, or 7.7 percent of the population, are going without.”

   
 

“In rural areas it's far worse. Roughly 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high-speed broadband, compared with just 4 percent of urban Americans, the FCC said.”

12,Successful longs: INPX &amp; FCEL,ei91gs,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ei91gs/successful_longs_inpx_fcel/,1,23,"Truly, a fun phenomon thrilling trade to end 2019. What's not like to like with these two stocks? I recalled some time ago that FCEL was indeed looking to make a comeback and it suffered an overeaction sell-off once upon a time I bought it at 0.30 overreaction. Now, despite INPX showed a downtrend in the most recent time frame but I genuinely think it will come back as well striking above the support 1st lv of 0.7, 2nd lv of 0.11, and breaking a new resistance of 0.13 can see healthy continuation.

What I do like about INPX's CEO decided to make an appearance and interview with yahoo finance. Most tickers who make empty promises cower in the darkness, but oh no. Oh no... not these guys.
