Outstanding Share count 55,517,013 a/o 6/29/2018

This is a ""treasure hunting""/underwater salvage company. They are currently excavating the historic wreck site of the shipwreck SB Pulaski which sank in 1838 off the coast of North Carolina. The ship was carrying some of the wealthiest individuals at the time, many of whom were travelling with their entire fortunes in the form of Gold/Silver coins, jewellery etc.

‚Äã

$BWVI has already recovered over 700 gold/silver coins that obviously predate 1838. Many of which are valued over $20,000 USD due to rarity and demand from collectors. For example, they have already recovered Gold 1807 Half Eagles, which can fetch upwards of $40,000 USD EACH! See link below;

‚Äã

To read more about the shipwreck and potential recovery revenues, I have included the following links. Pretty interesting story, and the stock hasn't yet caught on, but I think it will soon so I am ""loading the boat""... This could run to multi dollars in my opinion. Especially, since their partner EXPL recently signed an agreement to do a show about the Pulaski Recovery on TV! With mainstream media attention, this thing could go PARABOLIC in my opinion.

As always, do your own research. I am not and will never tell anyone what to do with their money. I am not a financial adviser. I am just a degenerate penny stock investor sharing a small piece of my research.

Seattle, Aug. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Baristas Coffee Company, Inc. (OTCPK:BCCI) Fueled by the widespread market acceptance of their boutique coffee product: Baristas White Coffee,¬†**now an Amazon Prime‚Äôs Choice coffee product**, ¬†Baristas¬† announced today that they have begun product and distribution channel development¬† for an expanded line of alternative and functional coffee SKU‚Äôs.

The product line which will use coffee, the world‚Äôs most popular beverage, to offer consumers the ability to enhance their daily coffee consumption with vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and other additives legal in the state which the product is being distributed in.

Coffee industry analysts have recently started pointing to the consumers' demand, especially that of millennials, for healthful products that provide added nutrition and functionality such as vitamins, protein, extended energy and Probiotics as well as functionality that addresses specific¬†issues such as joint health, heart health, memory support, diabetes and adult consumption.

Consumers want increased benefit from the products they are already consuming as opposed to introducing pills into their daily regimen as reported by 92% of the consumers surveyed as part of an internal focus group study.

With U.S. coffee consumption at over 83% of adults and increasing annually, the ability for the consumer to impact their vitamin consumption, heart, brain and digestive health in brewed and Ready to Drink selections is estimated to drive significant revenues to the Baristas sales channel.¬†

Current forecasts are to have the first of several 2018 SKU‚Äôs on shelves¬†in 60 days¬†while also focusing on an international licensing agreement. The US leads the sector and¬† China ranks second with functional beverage sales expected¬†to exceed¬† $20 billion by 2020.¬†

Barry Henthorn CEO stated: ‚ÄúCoffee is a perfect daily vehicle for the delivery of a variety of healthy supplements, herbs, and vitamins that promote healthy living and medicinal benefits all in a cup of the highest quality coffee Baristas is known for.¬† We have been approached many times by those wanting us to move into the functional beverage sector. And we now have a clear path to expand our offerings and increase our distribution channels.‚Äù
