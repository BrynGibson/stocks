OIL Moves Higher, AGAIN
 
AAPL, AMGN, &amp; AMZN REPORT
 
Russell the Big Loser
 
 
Today’s market got off to a lower start today touching the lows -430 before spending the rest of the day between -450 and -250 before closing -288.14 (1.17%), NASDAQ -25.16 (..28%), S&amp;P 500 -27.08 (.92%), the Russell -50.10 (3.68%) and giving up a big piece of it outperformance.  DJ Transports were -251.54 (2.92%).  Market internals were soft with 2.5:1 down on both NYSE and NASDAQ but the volume was 50% higher.  DJIA was 24 down, 6 up with the biggest gainer, AAPL +41 (this will be reversed in the morning) and UNH +33 DPs.  The losers were GS -45, AXP -33, TRV -32, MMM &amp; DIS -29, CAT -26, IBM &amp; V -22 DPs.  Strong sectors were consumer discretionary and communication services and the weak ones were Materials, financials and energy.
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled “How to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,” over the long weekend.

SECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today’s market.  The carryover from last night in TSLA and TWTR was muted and both turned lower, TSLA by as much as $100, giving up its big gain and finishing down on the day.  TWTR was as high as $3547 and came back to $28.09 and finished $28.28 -2.41 (7.75%).  After the close we had a wealth of names reporting with AMGN with a beat top and bottom and good guidance ran to $246 but came back to $236 and is currently 238 -1.20. AMZN reported a miss on top and a slight beat on bottom line and the stock which had closed $2,474 +101.29, traded down to 2,310 and ping-ponged between 2,400 and 2,320 and is currently $2354 -120.  UAL beat top and missed bottom lines.  It had closed $29.58 -1.63 and traded to $31.42 but has given it up to trade @29.80 + .22.
 
The big name was AAPL, which beat on top and bottom lines and does not give forward guidance initially traded from its close at $293.80 +6.07 traded up to $301.48 before hitting the skids and falling all the way to $284.75 and is currently $286.48 – 7.32 on the day and $15 off the high. Margins were unchanged and Ipad sales and the services sectors made up for IPhone sales.
 
 
FOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN -1.42, BGS -.38, FLO -.09, CAG -.77, MDLZ -.15, KHC -.59, CALM -1.52, JJSF -10.04, SAFM +3.05, and LANC -9.21.

OIL, $18.84 +3.78. Oil was higher again today and seems to be making a decent show of making an important bottom. Tonight, it is higher again trading 19.44 +.60.  The stocks were mostly lower with the market.  XLE closed $38.00 -.86 (2.21%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,694.20 -19.20. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday, I was a buyer.  Today was a serious disappointment.  Our calls fell back to .83.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8930 +1.05. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today’s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.89 +.29 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

I'm one of those dumb noobs.  [This is me trying to trade penny stocks so far](https://imgur.com/855sE59).  I've made a mistake. But I'm back on my feet and ready to try again.  

Mad props to u/co2_druid for his write up [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7z1w7/a_list_of_reminders_for_new_traders/)  

However, I'm left with more questions, and so I figured I'd toss a few out to the r/pennystocks community.  I know some of this information is available online, but it's inconsistent and I want the perspective of you fine folks.  So here goes:

**What % of your investment portfolio should be directed towards high risk investments like penny stocks?**  I know this varies with age- I'm 32, but is there not a minimum emergency and retirement savings as well as safer stocks/indices you should have before taking on more risk in penny stocks?  Is there even a consensus?

**Do you diversify your penny stock portfolio or gamble on one or two at a time?**  I get the sense that the more experienced folks are invested in 5 or more penny stocks at a time.  I find this intimidating and potentially inaccurate.

**How do you find your stock picks?**  If you get your tips from other people's tips, what is their source?  How do I go about finding a winner before everyone else does?  I've been late to the party more than I'd like to admit.

**How can you identify a pump and dump situation?**  And how do you avoid getting burned by one?  Or better yet, take advantage of it? 

**What is the influence of algorithmic trading bots or large financial institutions in the penny stocks arena?** I am unclear on their role in the market, and if I should even care.

That's it for now.  If you have any good resources drop a link.",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb8t6e/im_a_noob_answer_my_noob_questions/

Anyone else see that?

This isn’t an overnight short term play. But if you buy now and hold as we near June, I have a feeling massive gains from a percentage standpoint are coming. Their revenue is secured and only going to increase as they use their contracts to secure more contracts. Their resume is growing and so will their revenue. With that, the stock price.

21,DD on VISL,gb7hp1,PradoMV96,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb7hp1/dd_on_visl/,1,9,"VISL, they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless Telecom industry. They have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well. 

*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL.
[DD on his recruitmentt](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/23/2005120/0/en/Vislink-Technologies-Appoints-Jim-McGowan-as-Vice-President-and-General-Manager-of-its-MilGov-Business-Unit.html)

*Their recent contract bids that have been accepted. Sure, you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in, but look at who they are contracted with. It's a small sheriff's department &amp; guess who got them the contract in the first place? **Jim McGowan**. This shows that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, this company is still putting in solid work &amp; after they complete this project, with the help of **Jim McGowan**, they will continue getting government and military contracts. He just barely joined at the end of March and won them this government contract. 
[DD on this contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-wins-a-99285-00-project-to-replace-existing-infrastructure-to-our-new-ciras-6-way-all-integrated-receiver-and-antenna-system-for-sheriffs-department/) 

*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts.
[DD on theor most recent contracts contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-chosen-to-provide-high-definition-live-on-board-video-systems-for-the-prestigious-european-ferrari-challenge-race-series/)


*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology.

They will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting. This meeting will be on [May 8th](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-inc-to-hold-remote-annual-meeting-of-stockholders-on-new-date/)

*SEC filings: on 4/23/2020 VISL filed an 8K form, it only be bad if they were going bankrupt, but they are not. This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday. [8K](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14090499&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2020&amp;CoName=VISLINK%20TECHNOLOGIES,%20INC.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html)

*In the past two weeks on their company website, they share news of their current contract acquisitions &amp; each time they released something positive, their value flew up (albeit a small change) but still, it's a positive change. [Correlation](https://pasteboard.co/J6gfJAu5.png)

*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 34 dollars right now. I personally bought 200 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 200 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 200 shares.

Anyy, that's my take on VISL. I personally think it's a strong buy &amp; if tomorrow there's a dip, I'll buy more. 

Take care &amp; as always, if you have doubts always do some DD on your own to make sure you're okay with purchasing whatever stock you decide to buy. Gg fellas :)",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb7hp1/dd_on_visl/

-Grew 344% in 2019.


-Current market cap is ~$20millon.


-Sales target of $10.6million for 2020, on track


-Very green product


-Organic fertilizer increasing fertility of soil, increases water retention, decreases run off, increase plant pest resistance.


-Increased farm productivity replaces demand for new land and thereby HELPS Brazilian forests.


-Increasing productivity by up to 30% over conventional fertilizers.


-increased quality of crops produces, for example coffee beans are grading at a higher quality. 


-replaces carbon intensive fertilizers shipped from overseas.


-Is an Essential Services during COVID-19


-Brazilian real/dollar dropping, resulting in cheaper product for Brazilian farmers compared to imports. Will further increase sales for 2020.


-Proven and probable reserves of 777.28 million tonnes. When in full production enough to locally supply Brazil, which is the world's largest importer of fertilizer.


-US $1.98 billion NPV. Crazy high. 


It was once as high as $14/share but has languished as they have worked to enter production. They are now in production with increasing sales.  I own shares. The stock has been increasing and if they hit their sales targets the stock is going to do extremely well.


The stock is very thinly traded. If you do decide to invest and you're newer to investing do not but a single large daily order without limits. It will shoot the stock up and you'll miss out on cheaper shares. Take your time and buy smaller batches over a couple weeks, set limits on your order. 


Treat it for what it is, a possible lottery ticket and only invest what you're willing to lose. As far as lottery tickets go I think it's really stinking good odds. Make sure you take your profits.",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbddtj/organic_fertilizer_for_brazil_npkt/

The press release below just hit. I’m going in for the ride. Everyone’s at home (device) and electric cars need batteries. Here is their blurb:


BlueBird is pleased to announce that, following its review of battery metal trends, the Company will focus its initial 2020 exploration activity on its Canegrass project. The results of the review indicate battery makers are trending away from the initial widespread use of lithium dominated batteries, to newer designs which use up to 80% nickel, 10% cobalt and 10% manganese, and produce the longest lifespan and vehicle range. Bluebird's Canegrass project has returned high-grade nickel, as well as significant copper and cobalt values, and is located in Western Australia - rated the World's number one mining jurisdiction by the Fraser Institute.

Peter Dickie, President and CEO of Bluebird, commented, ""The 2018 drill program at Canegrass produced exceptional results, including BBRC-001 which returned 12 m averaging 1.17% Ni, 0.93% Cu, 0.05% Co, together with significant PGE and Vanadium credits. On the back of this success, we are finalizing plans for an expanded drill program to be carried out as soon as conditions permit in 2020.""

Robust Longterm EV Sales Outlook Due to Global Decarbonization. Driven by government and consumer need to decarbonize, along with falling battery prices, annual passenger EV sales expected to hit 10 million in 2025, up from 2.3 million in 2019[1].

Battery Megafactory Boom Continues. 115 battery megafactories [2] are in the pipleline worldwide, up from just 3 in 2015. Electric Vehicle (""EV"")

Battery Design Changes Favour Nickel, Manganese and Cobalt. To overcome travel distance shortcomings in current electric vehicles, battery makers are moving away from lithium ion phosphate batteries and embracing newer designs based on NMC111 (equal parts nickel, cobalt, manganese) and NMC811 (80% nickel, 10% manganese, 10% cobalt).[3]

Western Australia Now World's Top-Rated Mining Jurisdiction. Large proportion of battery metal supply from higher-risk jurisdictions, including estimated 33%[4] of nickel supply from Indonesia and the Phillipines, and 65%[5] of cobalt supply coming from the DRC. Battery manufacturers are demanding greater security of supply and Western Australia, a major nickel supplier, has now become the number one rated mining jurisdiction in the world[6].

Peter Dickie, President and CEO of Bluebird, added, ""Thanks to the continued desire for global decarbonization towards a green economy, the long term prospects for the battery sector are robust. With 115 battery megafactories under construction, and manufacturers beginning to turn to battery chemistries focused on nickel, manganese and cobalt, we are particularly excited about the potential of our project portfolio in Western Australia. Following a detailed project review, we are in the planning stage for a series of work programs aimed at advancing our Canegrass project, which is host to the full suite of battery metals, including high-grade nickel.""

Project Review Highlights

Canegrass Project Hosts Multiple Battery Metals, Including High-Grade Nickel. Canegrass, located in the Windimurra Complex of Western Austra, has been identified as the company's priority project going forward, with drilling in 2018 encountering near surface, high-grade nickel mineralization, as well as cobalt, copper, platinum and palladium.

Clear Advancement Path for Canegrass. Additional, high-priority drill targets have been identified at Canegrass, together with follow up drilling to the successful 2018 drill holes. The project is road accessible and has no aboriginal title challenges.

Drilling Planned for 2020. Following the successful drilling program in 2018, downhole geophysics, along with additional review of surface work, has produced several new and follow-up drill targets warranting further exploration. A drill program is planned for 2020, as soon as conditions permit.

Ashburton Project Hosts Significant Cobalt-Manganese Mineralization. Comprehensive sampling at Bluebird's Ashburton project, located in the Pilbarra District of Western Australia, has encountered significant cobalt-manganese mineralization. The Company is reviewing fieldwork options to determine the next stage of advancement.

[Robin Track Supply/Demand Potential Price strength.](https://ibb.co/6ZZdPPq)

&amp;#x200B;

VAL Valaris PLC is an offshore contract drilling company which provides offshore contract drilling services to the international oil &amp; gas (another essential global necessity). The number I'd like to see it breakout personally is 0.55. Support sits at 0.41 in the event if it fails to maintain growth. However, despite the criticism about this stock, it sold way too much. It's another reason more or less it also reminds me of FCEL. It's been way oversold since 3/11/20 and between the bands of the SMA8/49 you can see the bands are ever so slightly very tight. Observing the past, it was parbolic, to me from a chart perspective, this was more or less led to break the parabolic into a bearish, primarily economy-related issue. 

All in all, it has a neat target gap of $3.00 and an average probability of $1.15

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

Contains Dividend yield

Broke new average volume

EPS looks much better than it did in 2015

PB 0.01 (ranked 2/21)

Debt asset ratio not too shabby %45.02

PE -0.56 reasonable

They're not too keen on doing R / S according to their history DateRatio 03/30/1992, 103/24/19972, for 109/26/20052 (2 for 1).

Analysts seem to be somewhat 

Remained listing notice: Article 04/11/20

Oversold

Maintained a consistency at 0.30 to 0.40

Two identifiable Green candles signaling a bullish signal (see webull chart above)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons:** 

Media floating about bankruptcy but the anecdotal that I can say Trump mentioned (as mentioned previously about TTI post) wants to aid loans to save these companies before making that call losing business. 

Layoffs due to pandemic ISI downgrades Valaris to underperform -  

09:28 AM EDT, 03/09/2020 (MT Newswires) --     

Price: 1.4300, Change: -0.88, Percent Change: -38.10     (which explains for the harsh dagger drop)

Reason for the dip: Evercore gave it a underperform score.

**Questions I can answer:**

What's your entry? 

Personally, whenever I can.

Do you have an exit strategy?

 Pretty much as what I detailed above that seems reasonable.

Whar are you selling it at? 

I mean, no matter which ticker I pick, if it maintains momentum sometimes I hold. It just depends on what I see on the chart. So... I don't really have a target per se.

When should I buy? 

Ultimately, it all depends. Your support &amp; resistance should play a role in terms of testing; should you buy the dip, or should you buy the breakout line? That ultimately rests on you. I can't answer that, unfortunately. I don't want to give people FOMO feels or regret missing out, ya know? 

What do you think will be a confirmation for it to break out further? 

Reasonably, IMHO 0.80 but it has to be a strong volume.

66,$1 to the MOON Update,gbpku6,cgnSooner,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbpku6/1_to_the_moon_update/,1,43,"Hey everyone, I'm so glad you all liked my idea and wanted to follow along. Well, after the first 24 hours we have Profit! I sold my 2 shares of TTI at $0.50 a piece for a total profit of $0.07. I then purchased 2 shares of VISL at $0.305, and then purchased 1 share of TTI at $0.46 meaning I had spent my entire $1.07. The rest of the day didn't go so well so I ended the day at a total value of about $1.04 so I will be holding both positions though the weekend and see what Monday brings. I know many of you wanted to try this yourself so you should be able to download the spreadsheet I made [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YCe8uIoA64fEsqvvttBlxkeABfeeik-N). It still has my data in currently, but just change it to your data if you would like.

He sums up the points how BBRW is expanding its business into the international market and has millions of dollars worth of purchase orders. As well as he brings up how BBRW's board is meeting at the end of the year to talk about a potential cash dividend. I recommend just watching the video he summarizes it better than I can

94,Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Due Diligence and Analysis. Everything you need to know about $DFFN before you invest. COVID-19 Play. DFFN,gbn3tg,Cicero1982,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbn3tg/diffusion_pharmaceuticals_due_diligence_and/,1,63,"Below you will find a summary of the company behind stock ticker $DFFN. The research is my own. The opinions and analyses expressed are my own and may not properly reflect the underlying conditions of this company or security. You should do your own due diligence. I am not a financial advisor. I am an amateur investor. 

Background: 

On 01 APR 2020 DFFN announced they teamed up with UVA Heath and iTHRIV to combat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 infection. They have begun talks with the FDA and “will issue public updates as warranted by this fast-moving situation.” After this announcement $DFFN share price went from $0.30 per share to $0.75 per share before settling at $0.40 per share. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-8k-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-2020-april-01-18353

On 27 APR $DFFN announced their pre-IND submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a planned clinical program using trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) in COVID-19 patients. Under federal regulations, the FDA has up to 60 days to hold an advisory meeting with the Company, but for COVID-19-related submissions, the FDA has announced its intention to significantly shorten this period under its Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program. Clinical trial start-up preparations are continuing as the Company awaits the FDA’s response. 
To aid in timely trial enrollment, Diffusion is conducting expedited discussions with institutions located in areas of severe COVID-19 incidence, both in the U.S. and in Eastern Europe, to determine their possible participation. As a result $DFFN share price went from $0.45 per share to $0.85 per share before settling and holding at $0.50 per share until 30 APR. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-8k-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-2020-april-29-18381

Analysis :

Before the end of May DFFN will likely announce the FDA’s response to their request to begin the trial. While most traders are thinking of the FDA response many neglect to think of the European response. Therefore there may be two catalysts here. Much like recent submissions for other drug companies for COVID-19 related cases, it is highly likely they will receive an answer within the month of May. It is also highly likely that they will be given a fast track status. As TSC has had no “negative safety findings” or “serious adverse events” in their glioblastoma trial, they should be able to move directly into phase 2 trials. If they receive the FDA’s blessing DFFN share price will likely gap up and settle in the $0.60’s. As DFFN does not have a partner to help finance most of the trials for TSC it should not settle much higher than $0.75 at the most. The good news is that the potential high profile visibility that this trial offers will likely bring to DFFN to the attention prospective big-pharma partners.

https://investors.diffusionpharma.com/News/news-details/2020/Diffusion-Pharmaceuticals-Evaluating-TSC-Against-Acute-Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome-ARDS-in-COVID-19-Patients/default.aspx

Possible Catalysts:

1. Announcement of submission to FDA (Complete)
2. More info during ER (Possible date listed below)
3. Approval by FDA
4. Fast Track Designation
5. Grant Money or Financial Partner
6. Progress updates
7. Submission to FDA for advancement
8. Approval by FDA to advance
9. Progress updates
10. Submission for FDA Approval
11. FDA Approval
12. Marketing and distribution
13. A partner to market and distribute TSC

Possible Risks: 

1. Shorts love $DFFN (Clay Traders, Sabby Management owns 5%). With news pending the chance shorts will have a significant impact on share price is low to moderate. 
2. Reverse Split: On 17JUN2020 shareholders will vote to give DFFN the authority to initiate a reverse split.  DFFN has until 24AUG2020 to regain compliance (Share Price above $1.00). A reverse split will likely happen between 01JUL &amp; 24AUG if the COVID/ARDS trials do not propel DFFN share price above $1.00 per share for at least 10 days. https://fintel.io/doc/sec-dffn-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-def-14a-proxy-statement-2020-april-29-18382
3. Public Offering: Their last offering was in December and they have enough money to get them to Q1 2021. However last quarters financial estimates did not include the ARDS trial. No doubt they will get grant money, particularly with their partners at UVA. However if they do not have a partner to finance them in their other 3 trials expect another offering at the next couple of catalysis (Low to moderate chance) before July or amid catalysts after July (Highly likley). Good news is their last offering was priced $0.10-15 cents above market value. It is possible but unlikely they will dilute their shares again with the security trading at its current price.
4. FDA fails to approve the ARDS trial: Low Risk as there are no safety issues, they currently have three trials underway, and TSC is shown to work on Hypoxic Tumors in their Glioblastoma trial. 

Other Trials
-Phase 3 Glioblastoma Trial: Underway and showing promising results. 
-Phase 2 Stroke trial: training first responders (slowed due to  COVID-19)
-Phase 2 Pancreatic Cancer Trial (interacting with the USFDA regarding design of a clinical development)

Observation: Will likely get bought out by big pharma before making it to marketing. 

Revenue potential for TSC: (tens to hundreds of billions)

Patents: US &amp; Europe (patent portfolio ranging through 2031 with possible extensions to 2036  In addition Orphan Designations in the brain cancers, add an additional 7 years of exclusivity there.)

Investment Strategy 

Buy under $0.51 if you’re going long. Set your alerts. Decide how much money you want to commit. Build small position. Average down slowly with an equal sized position each penny or half penny it drops until you have the amount of shares you want to invest (should take days or weeks, not hours but best get in before the news). Be prepared to average down beyond your base position if necessary, but sell the excess you used to average down with for a small profit on the pops and short squeezes. This will not only increase your average down capital, but also pay for part of your position and give you peace of mind. If you’re a short term in and out penny flipper you’re destined to hold bags. The goal is to average down to the lowest possible price while selling excess shares on the pops with a permanent base position that will explode on news.

Important Reminder: $DFFN will need a partner to help fund, complete, and market TSC. No partner likely means no drug. No partner also likely means more offerings. A financially backing partner is the single biggest catalyst this security will experience!

Analysts price targets: I’ve seen estimates from $1.50-$3.50 per share.

Commonly asked question: Why has the stock price dropped so far?
Answer: Past reverse splits, offerings, and short attacks. All risks addressed above. Although I personally have paid for 100% of my DFFN position by averaging down and selling the excess on the pops. (See investment strategy above). 

Important Dates:

1. Shareholder meeting on June 17, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, by means of a live webcast
2. Earnings Report 5 May to 15 May 2020 (Unconfirmed)
3. Reverse Split likely JUL-AUG 2020 if not in compliance.
4. Offerings are highly likely after July to help fund FY2021

My criticisms and questions of $DFFN: 

1. They’ve been partner hunting for years. Where is the partner? Where are they in finding a partner? Are they ever going to stop diluting shareholder equity? Diffusion Pharma has destroyed their own stock and the money of their investors to pay the bills on what looks like an incredibly slow and foot dragging endeavor. For much if not all of their staff this is a second endeavor in addition to their career. A kind of “other source of income.” I question their urgency to develop TSC and bring it to market. They have a lot less incentive than their shareholders do in my opinion. 
2. Stage two Stroke trial is delayed because they couldn’t train first responders in time before the COVID-19 outbreak. I believe it shouldn’t have taken this long to train first responders.
3. Diffusion Pharma usually releases news about once a month. Twice on a good month. Much to the anger of their shareholders who would like more regular updates.  
4. The CEO is asking for a vote on a pay raise for him and his partners who own very little of their own stock. I believe their compensation should be tied to their performance on advancing their pipeline over the last year and advancement in their share price. This of course means an increase in pay should be certainly out of the question! At this time they live exclusively off of shareholders and from what I can tell their tenure at DFFN is a side job for many of them. 

Worst Case Scenario:

- Worst case scenario is that the owners and staff at DFFN care nothing about finding a partner and are just robbing the shareholders through offerings to advance their drug and pay themselves a secondary income on their side hustle. They will complete a number of reverse splits and offerings between now and FDA approval as the money they stand to lose on their own shares pale in comparison to the money they pay themselves through shareholder benevolence and the money they stand to make when they advance this drug down the road. (No evidence of this but looking at the possible worst case scenario.

Best Case Scenario

- Diffusion Pharmaceuticals announces a partner within the next three months. They also announce in the next two weeks that they have attained FDA approval to begin their ARDS trial. The FDA grants fast track status to the ARDS trial. Diffusion Pharmaceuticals also announces that they are back on track for the stroke trial and have fully completed training of first responders 3-6 months from now. DFFN comforts their shareholders by telling them they have plenty of money as a result of their new partnership and will not do another offering in the next one to two years.

What’s my motivation for posting this?

1. A month ago the trading value of $DFFN skyrocketed 150% on news that they were in talks with the FDA on the COVID-19 related ARDS trial. Many penny chasing investors got in too late. They are now holding bags waiting for the next news to arrive. The current trading value is hanging roughly around 30% above where it was before April 1st. 
2. With COVID-19 in the news $DFFN may be a seriously profitable speculative play if you get in before the buzz.
3. Knowledge sharing from lessons learned trading $DFFN
4. Peer Review on my $DFFN investment to become a better trader and analyst

About a month ago, this stock was worth around $0.14-$0.15 per share. They had a 10:1 reverse split in order to bump up the cost per share and avoid delisting from the exchange. At the moment, the cost per share is fluctuating around $1.2-$1.3.

As far as news goes, all I really know is that they reported positive numbers on their last earnings report and apparently they've been making decent profits on Amazon market.

I'm also aware that they have a business contract with Lowe's which is expected to come into effect in October. The contract mentioned something like $20M, TBLT branded products supposed to enter Lowe's ecosystem and they're also supposed to handle some of Lowe's own product under the Cobalt brand.

If you have any other news about this stock (or Lowe's since that would have some effect) let everyone know!

I'm planning to hold this stock until mid October and at that point sell it all if there's no positive change.",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbmjiq/i_hereby_declare_this_post_as_the_tblt_megathread/

If you saw me posting on the discord chat (I'm Grubsmack) and saw my last two posts here about UAVS, then you know that I was skeptical about the whole thing from the beginning based on my own DD. 

However, I think we were all wrong, and right, about UAVS. 

Disclaimer: Everything below is speculative, and based on my own research and DD. I'm not suggesting buying or selling the stock. However, if you're currently holding at a loss, it may not be a bad stock to hold onto if you can afford to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, AgEagle and Amazon DO have a partnership of some kind related to drones, and I believe that Amazon was the e-commerce partner mentioned in the last true PR from AgEagle. However, this doesn't mean UAVS is worth anymore than the about $1.3 it's currently trading at, and after yesterday, the stock may be worth less. 

The video yesterday wasn't fake, and it wasn't intentionally leaked. Megan Chilcott is AgEagle's founder's daughter. One of her hobbies/jobs is a videographer, and her job description for AgEagle prior to her gutting her linkedin was making instructional videos for AgEagle's customers. She uploaded the video to her personal website and to her personal Youtube, where she puts the rest of her other videos for other business (as kind of a digital portfolio). Prior to yesterday, neither her website nor her Youtube were highly trafficked by, well, anyone. So I don't think she realized that uploading it would be a big deal, and she has since tried to completely erase her digital footprint for, IMO, potential legal reasons.

However, Amazon and AgEagle had an NDA about the partnership. The existence of an NDA has already been confirmed by AgEagle, which is why they couldn't mention who the e-commerce entity was who had the purchase orders. This tells me two things 1) this is meant to be a limited partnership and 2) the partnership is probably because of proprietary software. I won't bore you with why I think this, plus it really doesn't matter in terms of UAVS worth. 

So, what now? Well, the fact the video was made public is almost certainly a violation of the NDA. This could mean AgEagle owes contractual damages or that Amazon can pull the plug on the partnership. That all depends on the contract itself. However, Amazon may also choose to do nothing, as this whole fiasco really didn't stray outside small stock investor circles. 

My thought is that UAVS is now trading at about what it should be, if not a little higher. If they do get into legal trouble because of yesterday, whether in the form of an SEC investigation or because of potential NDA violations, then the stock is obviously going to drop and the company could be in trouble. There is potential, however. If Amazon was the initial company behind the purchase order last year, they obviously liked something to have ordered more this year. Meaning, the partnership may just be getting started.

150,Something needs to be said! Everyone can learn from this...,gbhgrw,OHFTT127,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbhgrw/something_needs_to_be_said_everyone_can_learn/,1,45,"There are a couple lessons to be learned from yesterday's events with UAVS. For the record, I didn't hold a position but I've pretty much watched everything unfold from the sideline. 

Key Takeaways:

1. **Have realistic expectations.** An Amazon partnership was never guaranteed and people that held a position are acting like it was. This was purely speculation from the people on Reddit because someone heard a rumor of a potential partnership with an e-commerce company and each unrealistic thought influenced the next. A partnership could still happen... but with the largest company in the world? Highly unlikely. Be realistic when looking into the future, especially with penny stocks.

2. **Set stop losses.** Many people lost all their potential profit because they got greedy and expected the moon... and then some. The stock multipled by 17x in the last 2 weeks. From a low of $0.30 to a high of $5.15... and it's somehow the company's fault that the trader either lost money, didn't profit as much as they wanted to, or are now bag holding. Stop losses are your friend and if you don't make physical stop losses, set mental stop losses... but in a case where everyone sells off immediately, you'll wish you had made them. 

3. **Take responsibility for your own decisions.** Now everyone is talking shit about the company and the people who run it, even though they really had nothing to do with the trader's decision to risk their own money with a lack of realistic expectations. Traders need to take responsibility for their own decisions. Good or bad. No one is forcing your hand. Do your own research and try not to let others influence you. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. 

--

These are three invaluable lessons that every trader needs to eventually realize and the quicker you grasp these concepts, the better off you'll be. 

That's all for today. Happy trading and have a good weekend!",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbhgrw/something_needs_to_be_said_everyone_can_learn/

**Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:**

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders’ Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palatin Technologies is:

40% = US$37m ÷ US$91m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019).

The ‘return’ is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders’ equity, the company generated $0.40 in profit.

It currently sits at $0.70 per share, where I feel it still hold a lot of long term value.

* **Fundamentals are solid** \- P/E about 8 (ttm 5), P/S ans P/B under 0.5, D/E of 7. This is a company with almost no debt. They have 1.5M in debt, and over 9M in cash.
* **Management are taking paycuts to maintain cash -** CEO, CFO, and other board members are taking paycuts up to 40% to help preserve cash.
* **Jumping on the COVID help train -** CTX plans to begin manufacturing hand sanitizer in May (oh hey, it's May now, look at that)
* **It's a penny stock that's actually low risk!? -** Yes! Penny stocks are notorious for having a high potential reward at a very high risk. It's easier for a stock to go from $0.10 to $0.20 than it is to go from $1000 to $2000. But it's much much much more likely that it goes to $0. Crescita Therapeutics  is a relatively new company, founded in 2016, that's already shown it knows how to function in the best and worst of times. They will not suffer long-term from the pandemic, as many penny stock companies and other micro-cap companies will.
* **It's an alternative industry in the sector at the moment -** Maybe you're getting tired of all the pot companies and COVID test stocks. Why not go with some beauty? When things start to return to some level of normalcy in the coming months/year, and COVID isn't the only thing in the news, stocks may drop. When people are working again, they may smoke less pot (but probably not, honestly). One thing is for sure though, people who buy beauty products, will still want to be beautiful, especially now that's they're going to see people again.",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbjzx8/crescita_therapeutics_ctxto_is_your_best_bet_for/

220,DD on Tetra Technologies TTI,gbs1p1,PradoMV96,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbs1p1/dd_on_tetra_technologies_tti/,1,55,"TTI, also known as Tetra Technologies. They're known for being a diverse gas &amp; oil company. They conduct business globally &amp; conduct business in 6 different continents. 
Anyways, their business is cut up in three different divisions, hence why they're known for being diverse in this space. Those three divisions are: 1. Completion Fluids and Products 2.Water and Flowback Services  3. Compression.

Here's why they've been on the news and on people's mind lately. 
*They're headquartered in Texas
*Texas is one of the first States in the USA to begin reopening businesses.
*They have a earnings call this coming week.

You put all those three together &amp; you get hype and momentum behind this stock/company.

Now let's have a look at their financials for Q1 &amp; upcoming Q2 of this year.
- As stated from one of their news announcements back in in April 1st that went under the radar, [TTI Announced](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-04-01-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Receives-Continued-Listing-Standard-Notice-From-NYSE-And-Provides-Update-To-Address-The-Industry-Downturn) ""TETRA was also recently awarded two significant high-value completion fluids projects. The first one is a multi-well deepwater Gulf of Mexico project for a supermajor oil company and the second one is a multi-year Middle East project for a major National Oil Company. Both of these projects will start in the second quarter of this year. ""

These two high valued contracts will definitely be reflected upon earnings call this week on May 5th. This goes along the upward trend they've experienced from the previous quarter

As stated in their recent announcement this past month, their 4th quarter revenue jumped [5 percent compared to the 3rd quarter of last year](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-02-27-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-And-Full-Year-2019-Results)

This Jump in revenue for the 4th quarter is directly related to new technology and advancement in their tech. Here, I will provide evidence to support my claim. In the previous quarter, they announced ""Sandstorm"" and demonstrated that it's sand removal technologies is 95% efficient compared to traditional sand removal technologies that only operates at roughly 50% efficiency. After this demonstration of their **new and patented technology** they received a large servicing contract for the Permian Basin.

The best part about then receiving this contract is that it has been deployed during the first quarter of this year. 
This is big because it has gone hugely under the radar and I haven't seen anyone mention their new technology nor this contract they received and will be implemented within their first quarter earnings.

Here's my [DD](https://pasteboard.co/J6owYBb.png) on all that I mentioned above. 

Back on April 1st, Tetra received notice that they've been trading under $1.00 for 30 consecutive days which could result in a delisting from the NYSE. To counteract that, Tetra have been given 6 months from the date of their notice to reach share value of $1.00 or higher. Tetra themselves have notified the NYSE of their intent to cure the deficiency and to return to a share value of $1 or higher. As I've mentioned earlier, they've received [Two high value contracts](http://ir.tetratec.com/2020-04-01-TETRA-Technologies-Inc-Receives-Continued-Listing-Standard-Notice-From-NYSE-And-Provides-Update-To-Address-The-Industry-Downturn#) to alleviate their deficiency. Because of this, they claim that they will outperform the next two quarters.

Forecasts: [As stated on the NASDAQ website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tti/analyst-research) Analysts believe that The average price target is $1.13 with a high estimate of $1.25 and a low estimate of $1. 

Tetra themselves have a [target price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TTI) of **$1.08**

Now my personal thoughts and opinions (please do not take this as a fact and please as I always mention, do your own DD to make sure you feel comfy with whatever you decide to invest in).

I believe this stock will reach $1. As analysts say, they have a low estimate of a dollar whereas TTIs own target price is at 1.08. I feel they will gradually go up. 

Will they moon this coming week after earnings call? I don't know, no one else will know that either lol. But I do believe they rise.

Like I've mentioned with the previous VISL stock, theyre a relatively low priced stock. The volume isn't crazy high. It's only 2M above their average volume. And by simply looking at the charts, their price tends to go up with a surge of volume. I feel it's worth investing a bit into it.

How much should you invest? I don't know. It's upto you. If you ask me how much I've invested, I bought 100 shares when it was at .37 and I'll keep holding through the earnings call.

Best of luck to everyone! Hope my DD helped out.",2020-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gbs1p1/dd_on_tetra_technologies_tti/

My only concern is : How do they turn a profit testing for corona?
