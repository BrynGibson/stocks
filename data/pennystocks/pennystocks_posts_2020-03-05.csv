11,SNPW Heats Up,fdoyzb,Audacioustrash,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fdoyzb/snpw_heats_up/,1,0," 

Sun Pacific Holding Corp (OTCMKTS: SNPW) has been on the move in recent days as the Company puts out some much needed press. SNPW recently had dipped briefly into high triple zero land before the recent move up. SNPW has been attracting new shareholders and volume has increased significantly.

On Tuesday SNPW announced its wholly owned subsidiary, Street Smart Outdoor Corp (‚ÄúSSO‚Äù) and InSite Street Media (‚ÄúISM‚Äù) have entered into an initial one year business relationship agreement that will allow ISM to expand outdoor marketing and advertising awareness to increase or boost revenue growth with the Company‚Äôs street furniture panels within SSO‚Äôs Rhode Island and New Jersey markets. Similar to the Company‚Äôs recent agreement with Focus Media Group, Inc., this agreement will also be an awareness, advertising, and marketing program. ISM will act as a third-party sales representative for SSO with the right to submit advertising buys with respect to advertisers.

SNPW has attracted a significant shareholder base and it‚Äôs easy to see why; Sun Pacific has seen large growth through acquisition and has significant funding in place. The Company is also building a cutting edge Medical Recycling Power Plant in Medrcycler, Rhode Island and has a number of large contracts in place that should begin to bear fruition.

Sun Pacific Holding Corp (OTCMKTS: SNPW)¬† is a diversified publicly traded holding company. The Company has a number of subsidiaries including Sun Pacific Power Corp, Street Smart Outdoor Corp, Medrecycler Inc, Bella Electrical LLC, National Mechanical Corp, and Sun Pacific Security Corp.

Company mantra: From the beginning we have continued to build upon our management\`s knowledge and experience.¬† We have focused on our primary mission which is serving our customers and now serving our shareholders. We do that by providing quality service and equipment, working to keep customers satisfied, and by doing our part in protecting the environment with smart green technology.

The director of IBIO recently obtained 350k shares of IBIO late last year. In January Eastern Capital ltd, a private firm specializing exclusively in investing in biotech companies, obtained a whopping 37 million shares of IBIO. Both insider trades so I've linked the paperwork on the bottom.

So far 4/6 of Eastern's biggest investments have been extremely successful.

They are having a shareholder's meeting tomorrow which could also report positive news as well. They recently published a press release announcing a partnership with a chinese firm, CC-pharming, on the development of a covid-19 vaccine.

They have other drugs in the pipeline as well - an alternative to Rituximab, which is an anticancer/arthritis drug listed by WHO as one of the essential medicines needed by a country. The market for Rituximab is in the billions, and the partnership with cc-pharming opens them up to the massive Chinese market.

CC-pharming is located in Zhongguancun Biomedical Engineering Transformation Center. Further research indicates that this center was opened in 2016 with the backing of the Chinese government, containing state of the art facilities to promote the biomedical sector.

They have terrible revenue history so it's a purely speculative buy, but it may be worth putting a few % of your portfolio into this stock in case it blows up big over the next couple of months. The upside is definitely there imo.

Still doing some more research on this company so I'll post more if I find any updates.

Update: They recently withdrew a proposal for a reverse stock split. This suggests that the company is confident in their ability to raise revenue as well as maintain share price. A possible recent development inside the company? Definitely a good sign.

Update 2: Congress stuck a deal providing over 7 billion in funds to fight coronavirus. IBIO may be getting some of that funding (their facility was previously funded by DARPA specifically to fight pandemics like the current coronavirus). Still speculation at this point however

Update 3: They recently went on a MASSIVE hiring spree. They went from 8 employees in 2018 up to 55 employees in 2019. This coincides with their recent partnerships in 2019/2020 as well.

They averaged less than 10 employees for the past decade then shot up to 55 in a year. Definitely something huge going on inside that facility.

**Update 4**: They are close to releasing a vaccine for classical swine flu, aka ""pig plague"". Swine flu is a massive problem in China and epidemics can ravage the pig population. IBIO's fastpharming system is specifically suited to making cheap, fast vaccines to deal with swine disease outbreaks. If IBIO can pull off an effective vaccine that is cheap enough to be widely used for pig inoculation this would be a windfall. The chinese pig farming market is China-level massive.

Something to note is that the red tape needed to get a vaccine approved for livestock is much less than what is needed to get approved for humans. If they are truly able to make a cheaper, faster, better classical swine flu vaccine it may be approved a lot sooner than anticipated.",2020-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fdyqab/ibio_set_for_possible_huge_gains/

81,COHN Stock Can't Enter?! TD Ameritrade Error Message &amp; Weird Reason,fe3zs1,mralexwinkler,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fe3zs1/cohn_stock_cant_enter_td_ameritrade_error_message/,1,1,"Something in the air today made me feel like it would be a weird day. I think it was the lack of finding a clear gapper first thing. Either way $COHN our lead gapper had a total failure when it kept dipping (the plan was red to green move) and then buy orders were rejected. 

I had a few pictures on this I wanted to post here but getting the error message ""Images are not allowed in.."" so [here's where I break down my experience with $COHN and my convo with TD support](https://youtu.be/bU3fK3gMNfY). Would love to know if anyone else here had this issue today or in the past.",2020-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fe3zs1/cohn_stock_cant_enter_td_ameritrade_error_message/
