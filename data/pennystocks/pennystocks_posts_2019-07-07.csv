2,Penny Stocks that should be watched all ready for gains.,ca9tqd,glassofvin,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ca9tqd/penny_stocks_that_should_be_watched_all_ready_for/,59,48,"All are close to 3-12 month lows with now some rise. I’m not offering advice for money type deal like you see all over Twitter and websites.

My must watch list from lowest to highest price currently.

SYMBOL - NAME - $$$ BEFORE AFTER HOURS

SINT - SINTX Technologies - 0.1120
NAKD - NAKED brand - 0.1520
MOSY - MoSys - 0.1937
TRNX - MagneGas Applied - 0.2090
SLS - Sellas Life Sciences -  0.2323
UPL - ULTRA Ptrlum - 0.2651
TBLT - Toughbuilt Industries - 0.4615
EROS - Eros  - 1.780

Please research these before jumping in. I’ve been in and out. With each rise on these I recommend a jump out. Which is not a recommendation from the ones holding, so if you hop on StockTwits and visit each individual forum, you’ll read lots of hype. Stick with the news. All stocks have long run potential at one point or another. Everything listed below can see a 100% spike any day, but please don’t buy on the tip of the spike.

That’s why I listed these ones, they’re closer to bottom with steady rise. 

For all transparency I’m all in SLS and see this jumping to 0.28 easy, 0.37, .40, and 0.50+ with some positive news. Expect a .06 drop on average after each of these get tapped. Just think twice about stop losses here, BECAUSE once they see the dip you’ll see an equal jump back. Volume has been close to 49% in and 51% sold. Usually when anticipated targets get hit, SHORTS will sell, it will drop, stop losses hit and the huge volume of investors will see where this was and buy in at the bottom bringing it back to the target and when the high wall gets taken down we see 20-45% gains. 

Do not buy or sell on emotions. My goal weekly is 30% increase minimum on return and shares. 

For those looking to give it a try. Expect the losses, but if your shares are going up, then by the time you get back up to the high you were at, you’d be higher than you were before.


Example: 10,000 shares @ 0.20 each, $2,000 value, price jumps to 0.26, now up to $2,600. Still rising or dropping, set realistic goal. So say you sell at 0.26 a share and have that $2,600, and price drops down to .22 and now you’re at 11,818 shares and within hours to the next day pop back to .26 and sell there again, you’re now at $3,072. 

So let’s just say you sell at 0.26 and this rises to 0.30 and you don’t see it dropping, then stay calm, check another stock and if with time it doesn’t drop or say goes to 0.34, you are up 53% on your money. On the flip side you hold, go through the highs to find yourself where you started or below losing money. 

I look for the bottom and forget what the hype and emotions are from the majority. Expect panicking, excitement, anger and lies from others. Set your targets and get that money or hold and maybe get lucky.  

Here’s what my goals look like. Minimum standards and expectations.

$3200 base 7/5
30% gain a month min. Goal

$4160 Aug 
$5,408 Sep
$7,030 Oct
$9,149 November 
$11,881 December 
$15,445 January 
$20,079 February 
$26,103 March 
$33,934 April 
$44,114 May 
$57,349 June

10% weekly Based on 4 week months
$4,685 August 
$6,859 September 
$10,042 October
$14,703 November 
$21527 December 
$31,519 January 
$46,147 February 
$67,564 March
$98,920 April
$144,828 May
$212,043 June

Lots of potential to see 10% a day, but expect losses too. World is due for a change. Business ideas are becoming difficult, jobs at an all time high, but technology is increasing to a point where jobs will without a doubt be put at risk. I still work and could work this better if I could just sit and watch stocks like a hawk, but in 3-5 years I look to just quit working for someone else. 

Good luck to all of you!",2019-07-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ca9tqd/penny_stocks_that_should_be_watched_all_ready_for/
