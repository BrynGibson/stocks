1,$HSGX post 10/30,9s149i,chrispopp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9s149i/hsgx_post_1030/,1,10,"I know that the FDA meeting on the 30th is just that - a meeting. And there won't be news from it for a few days.

What I'm wondering is:

* how high will it go through the 30th
* will investors sell on the 31st because they don't have news
* should someone just ride it through the 30th or hold longer
* if hold longer, what would be a date to hold fast until

I bought in at 0.60. I'm thinking if it drops below 0.70 I should sell.

Thoughts? ",2018-10-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9s149i/hsgx_post_1030/

4,DD on DGSE... I think its ripe,9s4iv0,DickheadEngineer,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9s4iv0/dd_on_dgse_i_think_its_ripe/,1,13,"Here's the summary:

DGSE buys jewelry and shit and sells it for a profit. It's a glorified pawn shop chain.

They have earnings on Tuesday, after market hours, and their earnings are never negative.

They did almost ZERO volume on Friday and are at only .03 above 52-week low. Normally that's bad news and the stock is dead...

But in OUR case it means we found a ticker we can count on being at rock-bottom.  We are betting dead cats bounce for this one.

Literally ANY increase in volume should trigger a raise in value if none of us sell until market-open Wednesday. 

Of course, we will still have to fight off resistance from ancient bag-holders but that's never stopped us before.

If everyone is confident between this sub, r/rhbets, r/wallstreetbets, Stocktwits, and r/robinhoodpennystocks our community can most definitely revive this little gem

I'm curious to see what happens to a dead stock when she gets a little mouth-to-mouth so I'll be putting in 1% of my portfolio value on Monday afternoon and I hope you'll all put your confidence in me once again and do the same.

Let's see what happens when our group all works as a team. 

I'm not making any promises on gains or spikes but I promise you I picked this because I think it's a sure thing.





Here's the details:

DGSE is Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange

Established in 1965 and still going strong.

54 employees  in 4 locations. All in Texas 
https://dgse.com/locations/

The locations look pretty classy. Apparently they also have subsidiary companies throughout the United States through its facilities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, and through its various Internet sites


Hers the public website:
https://dgse.com/

Its legit. Very easy to navigate. Impressive and classy. Right up there with TOPSs website as far as design.


And here is the investors portal: 
http://www.dgsecompanies.com/investors

More straightforward, not as flashy. 
But it's easy to nav and transparent when it comes to the PRs and SEC filings. That's good

Here is a link to insider transactions. This shows who among the executive branch has confidence in the company.

https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/dgse/insider-trades

Looks like Mr Bret Allen Pederson has been on a buying spree all this year. Paying as high as $1 per share.

Wonder who he is...

https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=417432426&amp;privcapId=316947

Well, lookie there! 
He's the Chief Financial Officer. 
That's gotta be BAD, right?
The guy in charge of their books is buying stock like crazy, paying up to a buck per share, and hasn't sold any yet...

I think that says enough about insider holdings.

What about earnings... Consistent and rising. Never negative.
Check the app...

Good earnings, sexy chart, all-time low price, no negative catalyst or reason for low volume.

She's ripe, boys.

I legit can't find a reason for 100 volume Friday or the lack of spike in this down market. We all know gold rises when markets tank...


It's at .54 now
If I had to guess I would say we will see .80 on Tuesday followed by selloffs Wednesday.

That's the plan. Is you in or is you ain't?
