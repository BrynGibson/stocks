Balance Sheet Transformation Complements Improved Operating Performance and Positions Quest for Enhanced Profitability

$3 Million Annual Operating Cost Reductions to Date Including ~ 30% Headcount Reduction

Maximum Potential Converted Number of Shares for the $15M Debt Reduction Total Less than 15% of Issued Shares; Dramatically Improves Shareholders‚Äô Equity

EUGENE, Ore., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quest Solution, Inc. (OTCQB:QUES), a specialty systems integrator offering field and supply chain mobility solutions, announced agreements with certain noteholders that result in a reduction of the Company‚Äôs debt liability to such creditors from $17.4 million to $2.1 million. 

Shai Lustgarten, Quest‚Äôs CEO, stated, ‚ÄúWe have made dramatic progress toward the main strategic goals new management identified in our August 7, 2017 press release.  The efficiency measures we have taken and this debt reduction have transformed the Company‚Äôs financial strength and significantly enhanced our balance sheet, improving stockholders‚Äô equity, cash flow and all of our financial ratios.  The achievements to date have created nothing short of a rebirth of the Company for our employees and shareholders.‚Äù 

Mr. Lustgarten continued, ‚ÄúWhen the new management team took control approximately one year ago, we inherited an essentially broken business including a very weak balance sheet and an operation that generated losses.  Our top priorities since coming on board have been to deliver profitable operations and to negotiate a refinancing of the debt, combined efforts that enable us to build significant long term shareholder value.  We can now move forward with more efficient operations, modest interest expense and a balance sheet that can support the success we are driving in the business.  I would like to thank the note holders for seeing the opportunity to unlock potentially significant value by aligning with the Company and its equity holders.‚Äù 

Financial details of the refinancing are as follows (investors should also review the Company‚Äôs Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2018 which discloses information related to the debt restructuring including the actual agreements related thereto):

 	 	 	 	 	 
Principal	 	 	 	 	 
Total debt to the noteholders before settlement:	 	 	 	 	$ 17,437,799
Total debt to noteholders post settlement agreement:	 	 	 	 	$ 2,130,000
Total debt reduction: 	 	 	 	 	$ 15,307,799
Interest per year	 	 	 	 	 
For Old debt	 	 	 	 	~ $600,000
Settlement interest on new issued C preferred	 	 	 	 	~ $97,000
Saving on interest 	 	 	 	 	~$503,000
Non cash and Equity	 	 	 	 	 
Total common stock issued:	 	 	 	 	500,000
Total Series C preferred stock issued (Convertible at $1.00) 	 	 	 	 	1,711,000
Total warrants issued with exercise price at $0.20	 	 	 	 	3,000,000
 	 	 	 	 	 
Mr. Lustgarten continued, ‚ÄúIn addition to improving the balance sheet, it is important to note that we have made substantial progress executing on the turnaround initiatives we previously outlined.  Among the key priorities that we set forth and have taken meaningful steps toward accomplishing are:

Delivering sustained profitability by realizing efficiencies;
Improving performance by changing company culture, motivating employees and consolidating operations; and
Adding new advanced technologies to our product offering, positioning Quest as a high-tech company with unique solutions, generating higher margins and stronger market position.
‚ÄúOur business segment is exciting and includes potential integration of Artificial Intelligence Systems to revolutionize the supply chain and logistics management tasks. We are currently working on adding new technologies that will differentiate Quest from its competitors providing unique advanced solutions, increasing our margins and accelerating our growth.‚Äù 

Mr. Lustgarten concluded: ‚ÄúWe have made significant progress, and while there‚Äôs still a lot of work to be done, with the completion of a major part of our turnaround initiatives, Quest is better positioned today to capitalize on the opportunities we‚Äôre seeing in our evolving and growing target markets.  We continue to provide solutions for the supply chain needs of our blue chip customer base of Fortune 100 companies and look forward to broadening our customer reach.  Our new management team continues to focus on the development of new and enhanced solutions, with a particular focus on offering higher margin software solutions and services. Additionally, we remain dedicated to creating a successful and profitable leading company in the evolving markets in which we operate.‚Äù

Back in September, management announced the company was awarded a multimillion dollar project with a large, foreign military. This caused the stock to jump from $0.05 to $0.25 in a matter of weeks. The receipt of this PO was to be around January but has yet to be received. There has been other positive news regarding Mission Ready Services such as the stock was recently added to the TSX Venture 50 list. But it appears the stock will explode or burn based on the acquisition of this PO.


Has anyone else looked into this company?
