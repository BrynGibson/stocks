Text: Overall the end of trading week was pretty active and we saw many stocks producing big gains or losses.

$MBOT was stock that caught my attention because this stock was previous runner which quietly sat in my watchlist for almost a month. Price is still trading high from the point it started to rally and is trading far away from its short term price mean (20 and 50 moving averages). This type of price action is what I mostly look at from technical side when trying to find my potential short selling opportunities. In addition we witnessed many direct offerings at the market. Company did two in a row offerings on January 15th and than a third one on January 23rd. In simple language company issued more equity which actually has dilutive effect on its price and due to pumped up price this still haven‚Äôt materialized fully. And the interesting part is that on Friday stock gapped down and lack of buying power indicates that slow and steady drop down in price has begun. So I do want to draw attention to the price action we saw on Friday and remind you about three dilutive offerings this company did in the last 4-5 weeks. Stock price most likely (because of the reason mentioned above) will  start slowly to sink.

$TPNL is a stock that reminds me to $NFEC stock which I covered many times before. These type of stocks have same beginning of parabolic chart pattern which always ends up crashing. I never have seen stock price that goes vertically to infinity. Now if you are interested to understand what I am talking about please check $TPNL monthly chart. You will see parabolic chart pattern forming which seeks for a new peak. Stock price is inflated too much and in addition to this compensation committee of its Board of Directors has approved equity awards for five individuals working in the company. Some people that are mentioned are chief officers. This is very strange timing to pay out equity awards while stock price is flying high and looks very unstable and sooner or later will peak and crash. Don‚Äôt fall for this stock and don‚Äôt chase this stock. Better look for an opportunity to short sell or buy put options. I do believe it will peak this month and next month most likely will be red one.

$AMRS is stock with 427 million dollar market capitalization. Bigger than usual nano and micro cap stocks I research but nevertheless interesting stock that I thought might be great opportunity to look at. Everything started with the news hitting on February 5th. Company announced $255 Million cannabinoid development, licensing and commercialization agreement with secret partner. When I looked at recent November 14th 10-Q filing which when released made stock to tank around -30%, I found out about $AMRS huge operating loss and debt problems this company has. While in the article company is expecting to get paid when they reach significant milestone and company expect this in the period of 12-36 months but the problem is that they have lack of liquidity to actually go through 12 upcoming months. Of course this company should be looked at more closely but the picture is grime and the payments from the agreement are not even in the horizon. In addition at this point stock‚Äôs price closed the gap that was made on November 14th when 10-Q was released. Stock trades at 200 moving averages at this moment which acts as resistance for the stock price. These technical attributes are as well important when doing full analysis. I would be very careful by saying this stock might not see higher price but if the fundamentals will not improve and if this whole agreement will be blown away there is huge possibility for the stock to reach lower lows this year. So at this point monitoring and deeper due diligence is needed. Don‚Äôt get hyped just because of the positive news release.

$MNGA and $BIOC are two stocks with the same catalyst that made these stocks to tank on Friday. I got few questions from followers about these stocks and saw people talking about them on forums so I thought to give you quick explanation. Why did these stocks tank? The answer is stock offerings. I really recommend for those of you who are interested in trading these nano and micro cap stocks to look at the stock offerings and how they work. As well you should understand the difference between dilutive and non dilutive offerings while dilutive offerings are a common reason why nano and micro cap stocks lose in price.
