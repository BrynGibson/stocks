I've bought other stocks like this before and ultimately the fundamentals win out. However, when they report next there may be a bump, but the people manipulating will drive it down again. Just went through a similar situation with ICHR, heavily manipulated, but once it was not held down, it moved to a valuation in line w/ fundamentals. It's going to take some time for this to happen with ARTX unfortunately. More insider buying would go a long way.",2019-06-07

So far, AMRH has been good for me, but nothing like was assured. It has good volume, and tight movement. IMO, the stock is wound tighter than a pocket watch, and any news, good or bad, will spring it, one way or the other. Until then, it has a very reliable pattern for swing trading, and I'll keep popping in and out.
