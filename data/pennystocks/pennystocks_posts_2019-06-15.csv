6,"$ATIS Attis Industries, worth a look",c0rcbd,tmh0312,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c0rcbd/atis_attis_industries_worth_a_look/,1,5,"*Attis Industries* is a diverse organization with businesses in the healthcare, medical waste, and the environmental technology sectors. Attis is focused on creating long-term value for shareholders through acquiring and operating a diverse portfolio of businesses across a wide spectrum of industries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before you read further, know that Attis is currently delinquent on their SEC filings and working with the SEC to resolve the issues. There's a very real chance that this stock moves to OTC markets in the near future if they are unable to convince the SEC to grant them their second extension and a very real possibility they default after that. If you ask management, they'll tell you everything's going to be alright. As much as I love them, I've always found it hard to take people at their word. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I still believe that Attis Industries may be a great long-term investment. Their recent acquisition of Sunoco's Fulton Ethanol plant shows me that the filings may already be complete and that they could be posted shortly. Again, ""could be.""

&amp;#x200B;

With the acquisition of the Fulton location, Attis now has guaranteed revenues of $150m per year and a 10-year offtake agreement with Sunoco who they purchased the facility from. Attis purchased this facility for $20m and the facility has recently been appraised at a value $57m. This company has been selling at a market cap of between $5m &amp; $10m over the past few months (3.5m shares outstanding) with the major downside risks being OTC markets, potential loan default from past business operations, and bankruptcy. My current theory is that they are using their healthcare revenues to satisfy current debt obligations and keep afloat. If you want proof, I don't have it because they haven't filed their reports for a long time, hence the delisting possibility. Why they were given such a steep discount on the facility remains a mystery to me, but I believe it has to do with Attis patents. Once again, if you want proof behind that assumption, I don't have it. It's the only half baked conclusion I can come to without more information.

&amp;#x200B;

With their patented processes that were acquired earlier in the investment cycle from Greenshift Technologies, Attis is looking to become a major player in the ethanol business all while having industry-leading margins thanks to the patents. With this facility, they plan to invest up to $100m to bring other capabilities to the plant. These capabilities include producing lignin-based carbon fiber and carbon fiber nanotubes that cost 30% less than current carbon fiber competitors. According to about a hour and a half's worth of research I did, and Attis'/Greenshift's current patent portfolio, Attis is going to be producing the lowest cost carbon fiber out there. ""[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/24/1704869/0/en/Attis-Announces-R-D-Partnership-with-Iowa-State-University-for-Lignin-Based-Carbon-Fiber.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/24/1704869/0/en/Attis-Announces-R-D-Partnership-with-Iowa-State-University-for-Lignin-Based-Carbon-Fiber.html)"" "" [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aafe95/pdf](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/aafe95/pdf) "" The CEO makes this claim in the interview I linked to at the bottom of this post. That's a huge claim, so either they're lying or this company is a sleeping giant. There's still lots of research to be done on this single claim, but if it turns out to be true, I'm retiring in the next 10 years. I just thought I'd let everyone know that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personal things aside, the Fulton Location acquisition is just the tip of the iceberg. They plan to acquire five more facilities of equal or greater size over the next 3 to 5 years and with the recent acquisition, I've gone all in on believing they can do it. From what I've been able to uncover over the past three years of following this newly formed entity, assuming this company doesn't go bankrupt (huuuge assumption) and they can get their shit together filing wise, they will either be bought out at some point or develop into a multi-billion dollar conglomerate. Call me insane, but from what I've seen over the past three years from this company, this is 30% of my portfolio I plan to hold through hell and high water. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, why am I posting this here? In hopes that the more people that know about this company the more information that can be dug up. I'm only one person and I work a full-time job. I'll take what I can get. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you find any interesting articles, information, or accounting discrepancy's from this company, feel free to send it to me through reddit, post it to the Attis investorhub message board at ""[https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/board.aspx?board\_id=11038](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/board.aspx?board_id=11038)"" or send it to [HSQShops@gmail.com](mailto:HSQShops@gmail.com). 

&amp;#x200B;

I do reply to ""Fuck You's"" sent to that email address so also feel free to drop me one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck and Happy Investing!
