23,scarface910,eginqnq,/r/pennystocks/comments/aqtknz/how_many_stocks_do_you_usually_buy_on_average/eginqnq/,1,"It's a terrible, terrible idea. But the thing is people listen to those who present seemingly valid information to a company and why it will rise in price.

For example:

Company A's stock price has risen 100% to a price of $.008 per share. Pumpers(those who promote a stock because they have a stake in it) come to this sub and say ""Company A plans to purchase these assets in order to help the company grow, its price target is $2.10 per share""

People believe the hype so they put in thousands of dollars of their own money into this stock, hoping it will continue rising. 

If they're lucky, it will keep rising. If not they'll lose a huge amount of what they put in. 

In short, people have money, but don't know what stock to buy. So they listen to ""pumpers"". They buy in, they lose money. 

Lesson here is to do your own research on a company that you want to buy, and dont go on the word of anyone here.

Diversification on penny stocks is a very bad idea. Blue chips will guarantee a slow but steady gain if you hold for several years. 

if you want to gamble on penny stocks I definitely recommend throwing a hundred or so in. Basically .01% of your liquid assets. You never want to go all in",2019-02-15
