ROSEVILLE, Calif., Jan. 15, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. ([OTCQB: INND](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dkpMdPNtHKySVBm4NPy7H2yhbkVHV4FZyilugJte4dP0ogaGfhacUuIdp1ZUyKXgK9SHJw0XToCEPBuR8eS2VGWRHTWb7UYVWiH0GCm_WWyZaGNQZ3-IdROcqRlNBVljd7fwKEI1Q57Aa6_OBriSob7WRXg6SrrngmUpNHT0KfU=)) announced the latest ""Grand Opening"" of its newest audiological hearing aid retail clinic under its dba brand ""Value Audiology &amp; Hearing Aid Center"" (""Retail Clinic"") located in Sacramento, California. In addition, InnerScope has signed Letters of Intent (""LOIs"") for long-term leases on two more Retail Clinics located in Elk Grove and Fremont California to be slated to open in early February 2019. InnerScope is continuing to deliver and execute on its previously announced expansion rollout plan by opening at least 22 new audiological hearing aid retail clinics throughout Northern California in 2019 (""Rollout Plan"").

InnerScope's Rollout Plan of locating each Retail Clinic is based on key location demographic revenue drivers, such as, age, income, and high density populated areas. According to surveys conducted by [www.hearingtracker.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ehK1Glt4i2ye3nBjeXaEd-IV3RgKGe-ivCFBF4S0PdZKU09U_I3yOanzO4bds-k5h7PEDBl17a1phUoCmKm5mHXVfbSOgDanUYBBX-Yi_JyRuQJMpGcejnD6jDZ3UiIer-bKPo77TZ2LBA_5Nn_8sw==), approximately 35% of the U.S. population age 65 or older has hearing loss that may benefit wearing hearing aids but only 15% of those people currently wear hearing aids (""Conversion Rate""). Also, according to [www.hearingtracker.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ehK1Glt4i2ye3nBjeXaEd-IV3RgKGe-ivCFBF4S0PdZWzfrdRynwcdPLPH3MT1kHwgq9wakAj7HpBNPXA4MVEHQbZZwWrmsHmEMcpfTODcUZsNuaYHBD56gtq6ZR_wwInfXzrh1cAzLKTFJsclZk1w==)the industry average price sold is $2,372 (""Average Price"") per unit (a unit equals one hearing aid) and equal to 1.84 number of units purchased per person (""Binaural Rate"") meaning, 84% of the time a person purchases two hearing aids (units).

**InnerScope's Key Retail Clinic Location &amp; Demographic Revenue Drivers**  
(\*Per U.S. Census Data: average of 2.58 people per household)   
For Example:

InnerScope's Sacramento Retail Clinic, located in the Country Club/Arden-Arcade Area:   
*(One of the highest concentration of people over the age of 65 in Northern California)*

* 89,425 age 65+ households
* 230,716\* people over the age 65
* 80,750 people with hearing loss (35% of the U.S population)
* 148,580 total potential units sold Binaural Rate
* **$352,431,760** total potential revenue based on Average Price

InnerScope's upcoming Elk Grove Retail Clinic located South of Sacramento:

* 32,554 age 65+ households
* 83,989\* people over the age 65
* 29,396 people with hearing loss (35% of the U.S population)
* 54,070 total potential units sold Binaural Rate
* **$128,254,040** total potential revenue based on Average Price

InnerScope's upcoming Fremont Retail Clinic located Southeast of San Francisco Bay Area, fourth most populated city in the San Francisco Bay Area:

* 36,338 age 65+ households
* 93,752\* people over the age 65
* 32,813 people with hearing loss (35% of the U.S population)
* 60,375 total potential units sold Binaural Rate
* **$143,209,500** total potential revenue based on Average Price

**$623,895,300** is the total market yield in potential hearing aid revenue from just these three locations. InnerScope has the ability to not only penetrate the current market share in these markets but will also continue to grow the market by increasing the current Conversation Rate using its Manufacturers Direct Pricing Model as its Unique Selling Proposition (""USP"").

***""We believe with our High-Quality Patented Hearing Aid Technology combined with our USP and delivery model, InnerScope can take a commanding lead in market share of this 5+ billion-dollar industry,"" said Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies.*** 

""Once we complete our Northern California expansion the potential market yield will be in the billions of dollars in hearing aid revenue. This is not even including the repurchasing cycle for new hearing aids every three to five years on the average and coupled with over 10,000 people everyday in the U.S. turning 65 years old, the potential market yield is really almost unlimited. InnerScope's business plan and expansion Retail Clinic model is very scalable, there is nothing holding InnerScope back to continue to expand in all major markets across the United States,"" Mr. Moore concluded.

Silver has joined its Corporate Advisory Board.  The purpose of the Advisory Board is to assist and advise the Board of Directors and Executive team’s effort in growing Canbiola fiscally and in a socially responsible manner and the Company welcomes a man with extensive legislative and regulatory experience.  


Senator Ronald A. Silver was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1978 and continued his tenure in that body until 1992. While in the Florida House Silver served in major positions including Majority Whip (1984-1986) and Majority Leader (1986-1988). He also chaired various committees including the Select Committee on Juvenile Justice, Criminal Justice, Ethics and Elections and the subcommittee of Appropriations on General Government. He was then elected to the Florida Senate in 1992 and subsequently re-elected, serving as the Majority (Democratic) leader for the 1994 session.  During his last term in the Senate, he was designated by both the House and Senate as the Dean of the Legislature recognizing his standing as the longest serving member. His career as a lawmaker has yielded a vast and extensive knowledge of public policy issues and the legislative process, allowing him to be an advocate and servant for his diverse community. Throughout his tenure in the House and Senate, Mr. Silver has been known to tackle tough issues, transcend partisanship and build strong coalitions and in addition served on the Judiciary Committee, which heard all condominium issues. As Senator, he served on a variety of committees and was chairman of both the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services and Criminal Justice. His career in the Senate has earned praise from his colleagues, in both the legislature and other branches of government throughout the nation. In 1993 Mr. Silver was elected Chairman of the Southern Legislative Conference (17 Southern States) of the Council of State Governments. Most recently, a new prescription drug plan of Medicare-eligible senior citizens in the State of Florida has been named ""Silver Saver"" in his honor.     Since his retirement from the Senate in 2002, Mr. Silver also functions as President of his own consulting firm (Ron Silver &amp; Associates) and maintains his law practice in Miami Beach, Florida.

Senator Silver along with advisory board member Dr. Johnny Mack have been tasked with supporting the Company’s efforts in broadening the acceptance of CBD’s medicinal benefits into a broad range of applications including pain relief and wellness programs.

Senator Silver states, “The opioid crisis is out of control in this country and around the world and if we have an opportunity to improve the quality of life for people in a noninvasive, non-addictive manner we have a moral obligation to do it.”  Further Senator Silver adds, “The passage of the 2018 Farm Bill opens up a full range of approval and opportunity for expansion of the Canbiola mission and I am pleased to be on the team.”

According to Canbiola’s CEO Marco Alfonsi, ""Having Senator Silver, with his legislative background and contacts, could not be more timely with the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.”  Mr. Alfonsi added, ""Adding Senator Silver to the Corporate Advisory Board gives us a dimension of accessibility and understanding of the regulatory and governmental processes to help the Company succeed and grow to its full potential.”
