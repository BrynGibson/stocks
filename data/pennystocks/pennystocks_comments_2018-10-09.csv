1. Do your own research. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Don‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs stock tip at face value, do your DD (due diligence) and research whatever company you‚Äôre buying.

2. This is a penny stock sub and while many penny stocks can bring incredible returns, most will not and there are companies that will prey on gullibility. There are great companies with low valuations, often because of large R&amp;D costs associated with bringing their product to market. It can also be the CEO‚Äôs 8th business after running the previous 7 into the ground. Make sure you know WHY a company has the valuation it does and WHY you THINK it will have a higher valuation in the future.

3. You‚Äôre new so I would say, if you‚Äôve followed the first two suggestions to the best of your ability, pick stocks that you‚Äôre comfortable with and believe in, invest in some shares (be cautious with the amount), and just check in on them occasionally. You can follow news and keep doing research, but don‚Äôt be that person that buys shares at $1, panics, sells at $0.85 and then the stock goes to $10.

They do have a nice portfolio of IP so there is the potential that another company might purchase them to obtain the IP for their own use of licensing.  

That said if there was a management change that could bring a more intuitive update to the platform they might be able to gain their user base back but the current CEO and management thumbed their nose at the complaints of their users and forgot who they work for.  Developers did a piss poor job of alpha and beta testing major changes to a successful platform with their main user base and competitors took full advantage of giving those pissed off users what they wanted.  Welcome to the world of tech media.

This is a prime example of what happens to companies that think they know what's best for their users and don't respond to feedback.  The CEO's ""Steve Jobs"" approach to forcing his vision onto users was way too early for this company.

Should they miraculously release an update that brings back millions of users and find a less annoying way to place advertisements then this stock may have some life left to it.  If not then buying at rock bottom may pay off if Amazon or Disney decides to acquire them for IP.",2018-10-09

With Mikeymike426's permission, here it is...  
 

The initial discovery at Beta Hunt mine is truly amazing. To the point that many have doubts about the extent of the discovery. As the story began to develop we saw the strike length jump from 5m-10m-200m and eventually 540m and from 9000 oz to 27 000 ounces with the refined gold from the blast still not accounted for as they are waiting on The Perth Mint to mill and refine the tons of ore that came out with the blast. To date we only have a tally of the hand picked visible gold. It‚Äôs easy to have doubt since it has been a month since the initial discovery. However, they did not extend the strike zone without supporting evidence. They hit high grade gold below the Nickel lenses on level 14 and In fact, there are almost 700 kms worth of diamond drill holes from the previous 4 companies that have owned the property in the last 40 years. Some of which show 2300 g/t, 1200 g/t and many in the hundreds of g/t. In 2016, they released a report that is 187 pages and they clearly state that the A Zone strike length is actually 800 m. Maybe RNC is playing it safe and maybe we will see the strike length extended to reflect the 2016 assay report. We have heard people refer to this as a jewellery box find. Unfortunately, RNC has a model they have provided to the world that even expert John Kaiser says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about proving the discovery as much as it is about disproving it‚Äù. Eric Sprott obviously shares this sentiment as he announced that he is now a 10 percent owner of Royal Nickel and even went as far as to mention the Due Diligence being provided on ceo.ca, This speaks volumes to the work we have put in.... When multiple millionaires take notice maybe retail should be as-well. Nothing happens quickly in the mining world as there are many hurdles to overcome. Once a discovery is made geology needs time to analyze the data, plan how to attack the ore body, implement security measures and set up for a full scale drilling program. Each task takes time and attention as they don‚Äôt want to paint themselves into a corner. It‚Äôs not about driving the ore body and chasing the vein. Mining is science, architecture and geology all intertwined into a complex system. Mining is filled with red tape and procedures, all of which test the patience of the company and share holders alike. The geological model being presented is solid and only those who lack experience will brush this off as a one time find. Shorters will try to create doubt and institutions will push the price down in order to maximize their position. In the end it‚Äôs up to Royal Nickel to take the steps to prove out the theory and they have shown every intention to do so. Meanwhile they are extracting specimens in a fashion never seen before and continue to add value to the discovery. They have presented the technical data at two major conferences in the last few weeks and have rarely been challenged until some genius at Haywood decides to attempt to downplay the discovery. Look no further than the surrounding properties and the sheer magnitude of gold in Kalgoorlie and the Kambalda flats. Beta hunt sits on a dome with multiple shear zones. They have known for some time now they had a very unique geological formation with extreme high grade potential. Hitting the Father‚Äôs Day was no accident however the timing is all so bittersweet. Kevin Small tried to tell the purchasing company that there is 280 million in gold in the A Zone alone and it‚Äôs not even the main ore body... let that sink in... There are cross over features, shear zones, extensional veins and many many kms of vein to chase. Not every round will be 30 000 oz, but the potential is definitely there to find many bonanza zones throughout the mine. The best part is that it‚Äôs a fully operational mine with all the infrastructure in place to tackle the the ore bodies in very short order, all the while run a full scale drilling program. With 5 kms of ramp running parallel to the western flank and the A Zone, the sky is the limit :) either you believe or you don‚Äôt but the fact is that there is no other""",2018-10-09
