Since the last post, Mission Ready Solutions approximately $40 million in new contracts since Q2 - if they keep going at this rate, that's at least 160m a year in revenue! Their biggest contract was a $22.3m CDN that they received two weeks ago. 

**http://www.mrscorp.com/mission-ready-receives-cad22-3-million-contract-award/**

The company realized joint Unifire and Mission Ready Solutions statements on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) - you can take a look on how much assets, liabilities and revenues both companies have. Mind you that, most of 2018 was focused on closing the acqusition and they stopped bidding on contracts. June to September is the busy season for the DLA and they will hand out the majority of orders during this time. 

As for the $4 billion awarded in March, companies continue to bid on those contracts and they get awarded . To keep an eye on the contracts that get awarded, check here but this link is for contracts that were awarded 3 months prior. MRS started bidding on contracts April 22nd once the Unifire acqusition closed.

they are almost at a 52 week low 
 almost completed stage 2 of 3 in their mining facility, they are now drilling test holes.
About a month ago got government approval to mine.
Once opened they can mine a pound of copper for approx $1.10, compared to other companies where it cost approx $2.00.
Maybe im being optimistic but in the upcoming months it's going to move up and up i cant believe how cheap it is right now.",2019-07-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c93b2v/tko/

&amp;#x200B;

I am not trying to use some of my liquid cash to maybe make a little bit here and there with penny stocks.  I would like to learn these charts better and recognize patterns.  I could have made a killing with VYST already if I were to have gotten in and out of it.  I have just been IN and building since March.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my non-edited thoughts on why I am holding.  I am \*HOPING\* that next week is a positive week.  

I am not pumping or encouraging anyone to buy....i am just sharing something i wrote because I like to consume as much info as possible and I figured I owe it to return the favor every so often.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck and Happy 4th of July.

[If you aren't aware of their tech, here is a link to a previous write up ive done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/9oz5wc/co2_gro_notes_from_my_calls_with_same_kanes_john/) I've Posted what i consider the important notes from the write up below, link to the original source at the bottom.

* Announced Trials with 6 Canadian LPs - note all trials are paid for by the companies conducting trialing.
* No longer waiting for Health Canada's approval to simply spray Marijuana with carbonated water, this was being overly cautious.
* 24 new proposals underway
* Medical tobacco trials
* Ramping up activites in the UAE where Greenhouse CO2 gassing is not feasable.
* Teaming up with Ag partners and leasing their tech to them to help spread it across the industry and monitor for any IP infringement through mutual interest
* Annual run rate of $10M by 2020
* EBITDA positive by $5M/yr mark at which point management will start taking direct pay.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm waiting on confirmation from the CFO on the Canadian LP trials.
