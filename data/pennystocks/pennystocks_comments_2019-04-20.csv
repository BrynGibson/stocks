I think everyone is confused as to what you’re actually trying to do.  

When you say backtest, are you saying that you’ve got a scanner that should pick up stocks based on some unique specifics and you’re looking to compare that to some very specific data in the past to ensure that it will work properly for you when trading live? 

Quandl has some very granular data that you can utilize, but it can get quite pricey depending on the specifics.

You're not scanning stocks but companies and at that point it's a whole different ball game.

This kind of stuff likely wouldn't even be proprietary as well and is done through individual analysts combing through company after company in a firm specifically to make better investment decisions.
