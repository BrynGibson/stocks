Every month USO sells the contracts that expire that month and roll the revenue into buying the next month. The issue is that the physical oil for futures contracts is stored in Cushing, OK. It‚Äôs where all the North American pipelines converge.

But the tanks in Cushing are almost full because of low demand. When they fill at the end of May, there will be nowhere for new oil to go, people who bought oil futures are required to take delivery with nowhere to sell it. There is legitimate concern that oil prices will go negative if people begin paying others to take the physical oil off their hands.

When that happens, all of USOs contracts will roll into these worthless contracts and they will lose a ton of money. They are literally required to buy high and sell low in this market.

Better oil plays right now are tanker companies. When supply spikes, tankers get rented to just store crude until it can be sold. The tankers get paid to just sit offshore.",2020-04-19

The brokerages choose to sell them ‚ÄúOver-the-counter‚Äù (OTC) so it‚Äôs up to their discretion about how they want to sell it. As far as I know, NASDAQ has a requirement about the price per share of $1, if the stock has been trading below $1 for 30 consecutive days then they get a warning and typically a reverse split is done to keep up with the requirements. Not sure about other exchanges, sorry!",2020-04-19
97,TellitToTheJudge,fnw5u92,/r/pennystocks/comments/g49e76/newbie/fnw5u92/,1,"Very very few pennystocks are buy and holds. They‚Äôre more of a buy and get out. Take your profits off of one upwards price movement. If it‚Äôs a big company it‚Äôll probably go back down and back up again so take advantage of that. 

Also know that a lot of pennies are pump and dumps. Look up what that means. 

You don‚Äôt need to go chasing 200% gains or even 50% gains. Those common 10% gains add up especially when you factor in compounding. 

Always make sure the upside is greater than the downside, and the reward outweighs your risks and you can limit your risk by setting stop losses. Another commenter suggested trailing SLs and that is great advice. 

If you‚Äôre not yet confident in being able to trade without emotion don‚Äôt trade too heavily in any one trade. Keep a limit invested in each trade to a small percentage of your total capital. The point is that not each trade will be a winning one, don‚Äôt let that one losing one force you out of the game. You want to be able to keep trading so you have more opportunities to hit more winning ones. 

99% of pennystocks are not investments so don‚Äôt fall in love with them because that will make you hold for way longer than you should. Used to bite me in the ass all the time until I learned this.",2020-04-19

1. UCO is a leveraged ETF that tracts the WTI futures crude oil contracts. The fund rolls over these contracts from one month to another. And if the price of the next month's contract is higher, it leads to loss in value and thus UCO goes down.

2. UCO is going a stock split. You'll see this tomorrow at open. Not sure about the technicals but I think they are clubbing 4 UCO stock to make 1 new UCO stock.

I think it would probably break even if oil goes up to about $50 a barrel, you'd be wiser to invest in good O&amp;G companies with cash on hand, some (like Conocophillips) have the potential for 100% gains within the year and an almost nonexistent chance of going under. With that said if you're trading a small account like many penny stock traders then you might have a better chance of doubling your money completely ignoring market trends and trading the news. Because of the great opportunity caused by coronavirus I'm changing my strategy for the year to sector etfs and a few large cap individual businesses.

How much money do you need to make, Can you lose, and how long can you wait for profit / loss.

You buy .18, sell .30. Now you have .12*shares in profits. 

Was .3 the end of the uptrend though. Will it sink back to .22 and then rise to .29  before it sinks again. Will it dip to  .27 and climb back up and past .4, will it just rocket up to $1.

You decide. Usually it's based on volume and the cause for movement. Is it a real news /announcement of something, was it simply people pumping. 

 FCEL I believe doesnt have any current news for the climb it's just recovering with good volume. I am in a  small small amount at 1.34, it rose to 1.65, then busted to 1.52 before going back up to 1.65.

These stocks under 1 can get delisted if remaining to be low. One investor he trades 200 times a day and make a couple $100s to pay his bills. Certain days he knows it is not a trading day and pause. so he does not lose.

 These penny stocks are often manipulated by syndicate trying to boost up with a news or even questionable hype. So you take notice of the rapid gain you bought at 1.5 for 10,000 shares. 15 minutes later it drops back to 0.5 you lost 5K in 15 minutes. The other day one  popped 50% in 2 minutes and dumped it.  

If I just start I will work with stocks that have a lower volatility  may be between $20-100 to understand why it will bounce up or down. Those you can buy and hold for awhile until you think you want to cash out because you have another stock to replace it.

This stock gets pumped and dumped often too so you can still get small profits. They seem secure money wise and pretty transparent on where they are at. I‚Äôd buy.

With that said, you can definitely day trade on Robinhood, you just need to convert to a cash account. By default accounts on Robinhood are margin accounts (to provide you instant settlements.)

With cash accounts you have to wait 2 days for funds to settle (T+2) before using them again. If you allocate half of your capital per day, in theory you never have to wait for funds to settle.",2020-04-19

429,alexesver,fo01xof,/r/pennystocks/comments/g498fx/decn_not_your_typical_post/fo01xof/,2,"Trump mentioned and advanced test in his tweets yesterday and everything I‚Äôve been reading online and seeing from twitter points to this thing getting the go signal within the next day or two. 
They‚Äôre also creating a test specifically for the antibodies too I believe.
It‚Äôs 7$ for the unit.
It tests in 15 seconds and from what I‚Äôve seen has around a 98% success rate. So it‚Äôs very accurate and it‚Äôll be available for mass sales to stores and such immediately. They‚Äôve added staff and secured stable $ for the year. 
Now I‚Äôve seen some people saying this thing will go up to 18$
I think the target zone is around 2-3$.
It‚Äôs around 19 cents a share currently and about once a week it gets a pump and dump of around 5 cents or so. So for me even if it doesn‚Äôt skyrocket I can pretty much bank on a 3-5 cent jump and secure a little profit.
Sorry for the wall of text. Wanted to explain my thought process on it.

Heavily rely on researching the company ie: searching key words (twitter,reddit,iHub,incestorhangout, etc), reading comment boards, and looking at linked-in connections of management 

Financials are the title of a company 

PCTL is like a good book with a bad title 

Except the title can change (and is changing) 

Do I do this for a living? I do now...
