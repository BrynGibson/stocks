**SACRAMENTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2019 /** Falcon Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: FLCN) announced today that it has filed a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The invention is titled ''CBD Formulations to Treat Acne''. As previously announced, the company expects to have its first products available for sale on or before April 30, 2019. 

Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States. More than 50 million Americans suffer from acne. Acne is a medical problem defined by a persistent and constant inflammation and infection of the sebaceous glands in the skin. Often, acne coexists with other medical problems. Although some medications work for a percentage of people, a large percentage of all acne sufferers suffer from acne for an average period of 5 years or more with little or no relief. A person who suffers from acne can also suffer from self-esteem issues and even depression. No other skin condition affects more Americans or more people in the world than acne. 

The provisional patent application number is 62821332. At this time, Falcon will not reveal any details about the provisional patent application except for the fact that the formulation contains CBD and the purpose and goal of the patent is to secure patent protection now to operate in what is a multi-billion-dollar market. 

William J. Delgado, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Technologies, Inc. stated, ''One of our recently stated goals is to gain a competitive advantage in the CBD market and this provisional patent application is the start of a multi-pronged strategy to do just that.''

The Company's short-term goals which are in the process of being fulfilled are the following:

1. Complete supply chain agreements. 
2. Complete branding message. 
3. Finalize initial marketing plans. 
4. Complete initial distribution agreements.
5. Complete licensing and partnership agreements. 
6. Complete online messaging and presence. 
7. Launch social media campaigns. 
8. Complete competitive advantage initiatives which are of paramount importance to our business plan. 

CBD ( Cannabidiol ) is one of at least 80 active cannabinoids identified in both cannabis and industrial hemp. It is a major constituent of both plants, although the percentages of total composition can vary greatly from strain to strain. Unlike THC (the other prevalent cannabinoid), CBD is non-psychoactive while having the potential to possess a variety of therapeutic properties.",2019-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b3u2ej/flcn_falcon_technologies_announces_the_filing_of/

&amp;#x200B;

**WEST PALM BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2019 /** Global Digital Solutions, Inc. ([OTC PINK: GDSI](http://pr.report/6M3tOXGA)), a company that is positioning itself as a leader in comprehensive security and technology solutions, has announced that the Administrative Action initiated by the SEC on December 26, 2017 has been dismissed by the Commission effective March 17, 2019.

William J. Delgado, GDSI's CEO, commented ""I am grateful that the Commission and the ALJ presiding over the case were able to evaluate the extenuating circumstances in this matter. The company has been fully compliant with our reporting obligations since August 14, 2018 and we intend to remain so going forward.""

Since May 16, 2016, the Company has made significant progress in eliminating adverse legal claims and reducing debt. It also has accomplished its first acquisition since 2014 (HarmAlarm).

9,Step by Step Instructions for Setting Up a Free Penny Stock Screener,b3x8tc,investornaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b3x8tc/step_by_step_instructions_for_setting_up_a_free/,197,20,"I see this question asked a lot and I thought it would be helpful if I created a detailed step by step instructional how-to screen for penny stocks. There are many different types of screeners but this one specifically will cover oversold stocks that are on the verge of a reversal.

I have seen a lot of people charging for screeners similar to this one but everything below can be set up on [tradingview.com](http://tradingview.com/) which is a completely free service. Of course with paid services you may get better and or more accurate results but I’ve been using trading view for a while and have been very pleased with it.

Here are my stipulations for the penny stocks that I screen for:

1. The stock price must be under $3.00

2. The stock must have an Average Volume of 300,000 or more.

3. I use MFI so I want my readings to be oversold and under 20.

4. Last Candle has a change of 0.5% or better

Obviously, since we are trying to trade cheap penny-like stocks we don’t want to spend more than $3.00. I’ll be honest I typically play under $2.00 but I like to have that $1.00 buffer incase something is set up nice. We also need enough volume to execute our trade in and our trade out. There are plenty of set ups everyday with little to no volume. Trust me, that is a terrible place to be in.

I trade MFI on everything so that is my preference but you can change MFI to RSI or stochastics or another momentum based oversold/overbought indicator. The idea is we want to see an oversold level on the daily. 

Lastly, the change in the closing candle needs to be the reversal candle. We can try and time reversals and predict the bottom but it rarely works out. It’s okay to let go of some of that profit in order to catch in-the-momentum action. This is why I set the change to half a percent or greater so that we can see where the reversal is. This makes your trade a little safer.

I typically ride these penny stock plays to 3-5% and cut. 

So, now that you know why my screener is set up this way let’s walk through the how-to of getting it set up on [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com)\\

&amp;#x200B;

1. On the homepage of [Tradingview.com](https://Tradingview.com) click ""Screener"" underneath the ticker search
2. Select ""Stock Screener""
3. On the right hand side underneath the blue filter button there are three little dots to change the column. Click this
4. Check boxes for ""Last"" ""Money Flow 14"" ""Average Volume (30 Day)"" ""Change %""
5. You can save this column set by clicking the ""Column Sets"" button on the left hand side and then ""Save set as""
6. Once you have saved you can now adjust your filters by clicking the little funnel next to each column title. Use the parameters above
7. You've done it!

&amp;#x200B;

Now you have the stocks to keep an eye on! 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope someone gets some use out of this!",2019-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b3x8tc/step_by_step_instructions_for_setting_up_a_free/

ESCONDIDO, Calif., March  21, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – **MARIJUANA COMPANY OF AMERICA INC.** (“**MCOA**” or the “**Company**”) (**OTC: MCOA**),  an innovative hemp and cannabis corporation, is pleased to announce  that its wholly owned subsidiary, hempSMART, Ltd., a corporation  organized in the United Kingdom, will officially launch the Company’s  industrial hemp CBD formulated hempSMART™ products in the United Kingdom  during the Company’s March 23, 2019, launch event in London.  


The  hempSMART™ launch event is sold out, with associates attending from the  United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. The Company has implemented a  lineup of fantastic speakers, with some joining from across the globe by  video conference. The Company’s launch program will include an in-depth  overview of the CBD industry, its hempSMART™ products, as well as  marketing and compensation plans that will also feature information on  how associates can start their own business in the CBD industry. The  Company believes its hempSMART™ wellness products, which are formulated  with industrial hemp-derived CBD, are well-suited and positioned for the  UK and EU markets, as the Company’s CBD extraction processes have  reduced the trace levels of THC in its hempSMART™ products to below  0.02% of dry weight, meeting the current accepted standards for CBD  supplement products in the UK.

The hempSMART, Ltd. UK team has  worked diligently over the last few months to ensure its associates get  the very best customer support both during and after the launch. During  the event, the Company will recognize associates who achieved  outstanding pre-launch activity with an assortment of awards and prizes.  In addition, the Company’s mobile storefront will be fully manned at  the event, ensuring everyone can place orders and take them home the  same day.

Ian Harvey, Global Sales Director of hempSMART, Ltd**.,** commented:  “I personally have never felt so much excitement surrounding a new  product line being launched in the UK. hempSMART, Ltd. is poised to  become one of the leaders in the CBD wellness industry in the UK and the  EU, and I am delighted to be Global Sales Director, as we continue to  be focused on other exciting developments moving forward.”

Donald  Steinberg, CEO of the Company, commented “We are now ready to start on  the global rollout of our hempSMART™ products.  Our software is set to  accommodate many countries, our product line has been well developed and  we have leaders throughout the world ready to take up their roles as  country directors.  Launching in the UK is especially meaningful, as  London was the launch pad for one of my prior projects, One World  Communications, which expanded operations to 50 countries with well over  150,000 affiliates in nine months. As the founder of that company, I  feel an even greater excitement with this rollout.”

Dianna  Steinberg, head of hempSMART™ product development, stated, “After having  received the groundbreaking patent for brain function and nootropics  following the recent changes in regulations, our company is thrilled to  be opening in the UK. We are especially looking forward to working with  not only our health professionals but all of the thousands of people in  our past organizations.”
