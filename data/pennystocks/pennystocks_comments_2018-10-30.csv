Though right now there biggest (and most promising) angle is their patent on Very Low Nicotine. The FDA loves them and there’s potential for all regulations leading to XXII having a total monopoly on US tobacco.

They’ve proven to be the only company capable of consistently meeting VLN standards, which I believe means their tobacco is 95%+ free of nicotine, yet still gives similar sensations. Big T companies have been unable to even come close. This is simultaneously while FDA cracks down on e-cigs.

It’s been a very long and slow journey, but it so far has been a pretty solid long. Many heavy hitters, both individuals and institutions, have invested heavily in this company.

I don’t put all my eggs in one basket, but XXII is  definitely holds majority of my portfolio anymore. If all goes well, which is often does not, could be a recipe for very, very huge gains in the future.

But as always, definitely do more DD before considering jumping in. And expect many slow, boring, or red days lol",2018-10-30
