40,ryano46,ea4m426,/r/pennystocks/comments/9yt7sg/opinions_on_trxc/ea4m426/,1,"It's not, this guy knows nothing. This is a legitimate company that has sold a respectable amount of million dollar robots over the last year. They have hit all their road map approvals so far and have a few more schedule thru 2019. All of these approvals will augment the platform to make it more appealing to hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

The bullish expectation is that robots sales pick up throughout 2019. Some driving factors here would be - 

1) the platform gets more robust thus increasing it's value proposition, 

2) additional publications are released from US hospitals with positive feedback, 

3) other hospitals see competitors buying the robot and begin purchasing it to stay cutting edge (this is was a sales catalyst for intuitive back in the day). 

4) Haptic feedback, eye motion tracking, recent MST IP integrations (late 2019), 3MM instruments, cheaper per procedure costs are enough to drive sales.

&amp;#x200B;

The bearish sentiment also has some merit - that is if you sift through all the shit 'short' garbage articles (aka everything on seeking alpha). 

1) Growth into this market is costly and TRXC only has money to carry them thru 2020, it's fair to assume the may need to raise capital again before significant momentum is achieved. 

2) The platform has a huge OR footprint and when in use and being stored (this is a big point for shorts, but also a legit 'drawback' reported in a the latest Florida Hospital publication)

3) Current and upcoming competitors are monoliths. Intuitive Surgical has had a monopoly for years. Google and JnJ have a joint venture thru Verb Surgical. Verb is still a ways away, but it's possible a hospital could chose to wait if their progress looks good. Verb is also focusing on a 'digitized' approach much like TRXC.

4) The robot is fairly old and looks like it. From a marketing perspective it may be a harder sell. Of course results are actually what matters - but it's worth mentioning.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately it's a high risk/high reward play both in the short and long term. All the really matters is robot sales - everything else will just help with short swings.
