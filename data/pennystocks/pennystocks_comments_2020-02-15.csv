Look at big % gainers and find if they are earnings winners, contract winners, or big news winners. Pair that with trading breakouts and shorting breakdowns this is a fine strategy to be a profitable trader.

My screener would look something like:

52 week high: 0-10% below

This works well for me bc I only get like 10 stocks per day, 20 MAX. I have another job. I like to take a look at charts and the more things that look good the better it seems the stock is poised for a breakout. (Ex. 2 year bullrun, 5 year bull run, Earnings winner, broke 2 year resistance, at 52 week new highs.)

Then just make a watchlist and for me I like to make a price alert so when a stock hits a level I get notified. I like to buy early or at end of day mid day is often choppy and unpredictable. 

If you like to short it’s basically all opposite. (Ex. 2 year bear run, 5 year bear run, up on no news, double top on resistance.)

A more balanced strategy, if you want to go for the approval profit is to get in early, take advantage of the run-up, then sell part of your holdings before the PDUFA so that you are at a zero balance. Then anything after PDUFA is pure profit.

Personally I would never buy on a PDUFA approval like you are suggesting. As they say, ""buy the rumour, sell the news"". I find that the price action on a PDUFA date is that there is a gap up in the morning which then subsides somewhat as people take profits.",2020-02-15

I kept like $100 in it to see if the PDUFA would bump it up, it did, and I put in many sell orders after hours (constantly editing my limit price to be around the stock price) and will know if it sold on Tuesday, if it didn't then I'll try to sell it ASAP. It might go up because it is a genuinely high potential/value pharmaceutical but it will take a long time to materialize and lawsuits can rapidly destroy such companies.
