6,The right time to by this blockchain stock (TSX.V LTV),7vtmry,timethcaper,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7vtmry/the_right_time_to_by_this_blockchain_stock_tsxv/,1,2,"TL;DR version:

LeoNovus is a provider of solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology. It was included as a major underlying component in a recently launched blockchain ETF. Blockchain stocks are all the hype, but LTV actually has solid fundamentals. It currently has projects with government of Canada, large Canadian bank, and a Canadian college. It is currently on a hot hiring spree for more software engineers as it vamps up its platform and take up more projects (just google LeoNovus careers). For more info on their recent accomplishments, check out the list on the bottom! If you want to invest in blockchain companies without trading cryptos, LTV is one of your best bets! 

Long version:

A year ago today, bitcoin was at $1025USD, ethereum was at $11.3USD, NEO was not even a thing… Even with the current crypto market sell off, if you have bought bitcoin and ethereum a year ago, you are still up 580% and 5800% on your investments, respectively. However, don’t beat yourself too hard if you have missed the crypto rally. There are still other opportunities, namely the rise of the blockchain technology.

You may wonder isn’t betting on cryptocurrencies the same as betting on blockchain technologies. Not really. Why?

1)   **Not every blockchain needs a native currency.** There are two types of blockchain – public and private. The difference between public and private blockchains is similar to the differences between Internet and intranet. The Internet is an open public space that anyone can tap into, while an intranet is designed to be a private space. Both bitcoin and ethereum are public blockchains. All transactions on a blockchain must be validated and embedded in data blocks, which essentially form the blockchain. Since the creators of public blockchains likely do not have the processing capabilities to handle all the transactions alone, miners step in. Miners on public blockchains need a reward for verifying transactions, therefore, cryptocurrencies are necessary for the operations of public blockchains. On the other hand, private blockchains are internal networks that are tightly controlled and do not require the need for a robust network of miners to verify transactions/blocks. Private blockchains are primarily used for business application where access to the chain is limited to certain parties. Cryptocurrencies are not a necessary component for most private blockchains.

2)   **Regulators are keeping their eyes close to cryptocurrencies and are trying to regulate them. However, they have shown very supportive attitude towards the development of blockchain technologies.** At this point, the consensus view is that: at some point down the road, blockchain will revolutionize part of, if not the whole, society. Regulators may frown upon cryptocurrencies given their speculative nature, but they have also come to realize that they cannot afford not to embrace blockchain technologies. In December 2017, Janet Yellen called bitcoin as a “highly speculative asset”. As to a government-issued digital currencies, she commented ”While we’re looking at research on this topic, there are, I think to my mind, limited benefits from introducing it, a limited need for it and some substantial concerns.” Blockchain technologies have definitely started being adopted across multiple departments in the US government. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, The Department of Defense Transportation Command, The Food &amp; Drug Administration all have issued notices saying they would looking into potential application of blockchain technologies.

Why should you invest in blockchain technology stocks?

1)  **Blockchain technology is not a fad.** Many of the applications have passed the proof-of-concept stage, and started being adopted for social and business uses.

2)  **It is investing in the next “big thing”.** Talking about blockchain today is like talking about the Internet back in the 90s – it is just difficult for people to imagine its specific applications. But most of us can see it being broadly applied.

3)  **Unlike cryptocurrencies which are highly speculative, the development of blockchain technology has its fundamentals.** So far, it has been hard if not impossible to time all the cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, investing in blockchain stocks comes down to understanding applications of the technology and evaluating businesses, which can be much more predictable. 

4) You may say, well, a lot of this blockchain stocks sell off when the cryptocurrency market melts. True. But investors panicking over their blockchain stock holdings when the cryptocurrencies are down just indicates how naïve those investors are – they look at blockchain stocks as another way to profit on cryptocurrencies, which is totally wrong. **And if anything, it means opportunities for better educated investors.**

5)  **Opportunities are yet to come.** The realm of public blockchains and their native assets is most relevant to the innovative investor at this stage. Private blockchains have not yield an entirely new asset class that is investable to the public. However, with the rise of blockchain technology, I believe this will come, and it will create new investment opportunities.


That being said, don’t just throw your money into any start-up companies that have the word ""blockchain"" in their names. There are a ton of garbage stocks out there doing nothing in blockchain and just waiting to monetize on stockholders’ hard-earned money. 

Investing in blockchain technology stocks is no easy task, it requires a lot of due diligence. One of the most basic questions investors need to ask is: Does the blockchain technology project make sense? This applies to both public and private blockchains. For example, STEEM is a public blockchain many investors are familiar with (Currently, it is among the top 20 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap.) STEEM aims to offer a blockchain-based social media platform, where users can earn rewards through activities such as posting. But, think for a second. Do we need a decentralized Facebook? If not, well, this is exactly what STEEM does. This spells out the biggest challenge many investors face. **We all agree that blockchain will become a big thing, but not every company needs to get on a blockchain and not every company will benefit from a decentralized system.** Unless the management actually understands blockchain technology and how their company in particular will benefit from it, many of their new initiative on blockchain could just be noise. And it is investors' job to filter through it.

Moreover, don’t expect a 200% return on your blockchain technology stocks in a year if you invest in the companies like Intel, Amazon or Walmart. I get it, all of the giants have said they are engaging in blockchain, and I believe they have the ability to come up with interesting things. But how much of they company earnings will be driven by the blockchain initiatives? And what’s the fraction of that will be translated into their stock prices? Tiny, probably.

So, after all this talk, here is one stock I like a lot - LeoNovus (TSX.V: LTV). I have been following the stock for four months now. The company has undergone rapid growth in the one year time since it launched its first product. The company is offering specific solutions to cloud data storage using blockchain technology - this project has broad applications; and cloud data storage can be truly made more secure yet accessible with blockchain technology. On the technical front, LTV is partnering with DTL Labs, the company behind Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, and JP Morgan’s Quorum. On the application front, LTV has signed contracts with the Government of Canada, one of the Canadian leading banks, a leading Canadian college, and a global healthcare data provider to install their platform. As a start-up company that only started selling its products less than a year ago, these are significant achievements. The stock has been recently sold off a lot with the broader crypto sell off, even on the backdrop of great new developments. To me this is a buying opportunity. 


For more details on the company, keep reading...

Leonovus is a blockchain-hardened software-defined cloud storage solutions provider for enterprise. Their patented algorithms virtualize, transform, slice and disperse data across a network of on-premises, hybrid or multi-cloud storage nodes, which allows for secure object-based data storage that across the entire solution. The architecture is designed to minimize latency, optimize availability, reduce remote backup costs and meet data sovereignty requirements.

They have strong management team! I dug in on their employees profile and found most of them have strong IT architecture and software background, this is especially true for those who at the top of the company structure. So many of the start-up blockchain companies are ran by people in the financial industry. Well, no offense, as I am also one of the capital market employees, but really, how much do we actually know about the technicals to develop a great blockchain project. Very little I would say.

Leonovus launched its first product at the beginning of 2017. Within one year, the company has undergone rapid growth in product development, sales, as well as partnership. Here is a timeline of major events:
January 10, 2017 - Leonovus launched its software-defined object storage solution solving security and compliance requirements for enterprise cloud storage. The solution is designed to bring enterprise cloud users an increased level of data security, recoverability and compliance across any combination of cloud storage solutions. The solution is hardware and software agnostic, which cuts implementation costs for enterprise. As an Oracle Gold Cloud Partner, Leonovus complements Oracle’s storage solution offerings by bringing GRC (governance, risk management and compliance) to Oracle’s IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud storage solutions and providing a foundation for enhanced GRC in all of Oracle’s cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.

January 30, 2017 - The software-defined object storage solution is in trials by one of the largest public colleges in North America to ensure its sensitive data meets compliance standards and remains secure within the cloud. Leonovus will begin with the institution’s multi-cloud environment in late February 2017, with the potential of being implemented into the other 24 post-secondary schools within its peer network over the next 24 months.

June 21, 2017 - The new product, Leonovus 365, targets the installed base of 89 million Microsoft 365 users. It provides Microsoft 365 with advanced security and compliance features, and it can pool the cloud storage from all the OneDrive licenses into one managed cloud storage instance. Users are able to achieve advanced collaboration in Leonovus 365.

September 26, 2017 - Leonovus announced enhancements to its existing data storage solution via the integration of blockchain technology. The company’s core technologies offer scalable distributed data storage with improved security, governance, and compliance while reducing costs, risk and providing additional defense against cybersecurity threats. The utilization of blockchain technology further enhances its effectiveness. The company’s previous adoption of blockchain technologies:


1st - In 2014, the company produced and deployed a managed, loosely-coupled blockchain computation pool built from available idle resources. The system managed both public and private blockchain computation on thousands of low/no-cost computing cores across North America with only a few clicks of a mouse from a browser-based dashboard.

2nd - In 2014, the company leveraged its proprietary distributed computing technology to mine digital currency from low-end distributed devices.

October 4, 2017 - Leonovus partnered with DLT Labs to accelerate the engineering of the blockchain components of the storage solution. DLT Labs is a global leader in implementing permissioned and non-permissioned blockchain solutions for enterprises. The Lab has extensive enterprise experience and expertise with all distributed ledger/blockchain technologies including Enterprise Ethereum, IBM’s Fabric, R3’s Corda, JP Morgan’s Quorum, and etc.. During one interview with DLT Labs, they expressed firm belief that Leonovus would continue market leadership in the field.

October 23, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with one of Canada’s “big six” banks (For those who live in the U.S., Canadian banking sector is entirely dominated by the six biggest banks, and there are not regional banks.) Leonovus will install its blockchain-hardened software to assist the bank in developing a multi-site data storage management fabric with data security, performance and compliance metrics that meet the bank’s data governance policies. Leonovus will also help the bank to leverage and maximize its current storage assets to form a secure and compliant private cloud storage network that will dramatically reduce data storage costs while increasing data security.

November 3, 2017 - Leonovus signed a proof of concept agreement with a global health data services company. This project will help deliver an improved user experience to the 20,000 Citrix users. This project came from the challenge that data may reside in different geographical business zones. As such a business user who lives in the North American Zone may have to log in and pull a file back from the European Zone. Due to inter-continental latencies, pulling in data from another geographic zone provides the end user with a poor experience, causing frustration and potential delays. Leonovus blockchain-hardened can be the solution to this problem.

January 24, 2017 - After four months of technical and market evaluation by the Government of Canada (GOC), Leonovus is pre-qualified to receive up to $500,000 purchase order from the GOC. The next step is to choose the sponsoring GOC department. There is potential for three additional $500,000 purchase orders in 2018, paid from departmental budgets.

Other than the above-mentioned breakthroughs, Leonovus has committed to many new partnerships with established companies in IT infrastructure services, cyber security, and data providers, to further access the total market for the technology. These companies include: ZoneTI (Canada-based), Snowy River International (Canada-based), Storage Made Easy (UK-based), FlexTy Solutions Inc. (Canada-based), ApexIT (US-based).

Back in June 2017, Leonovus has started to follow Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), which is a joint American and Canadian security accreditation program for cryptographic modules. The program is for vendors who seek to have their products certified for use by the U.S./Canadian Government and regulated industries that collect, store, transfer, share and disseminate ""sensitive, but not classified"" information. The certification process is expected to be completed in eight to twelve months. This will help broaden the use of Leonovus’ products.



Last but probably the best point to buy LTV today is... 

A momentum trade is also likely to push LTV stock higher tomorrow. The very first Canadian blockchain technology ETF (TSX: HBLK) is about to start trading on Feb 7th, 2018. LTV has a significant weight in the ETF portfolio. Given the high demand in blockchain ETFs, I expect the ETF will start trading with high buying volume. For each unit of the ETF sold, the ETF provider needs to go buy the corresponding number of underlying stocks to back it up. For emerging companies such as LTV, if the ETF has high trading volume, it will definitely drive up the demand for the stocks.
Just to give you a rough measure. When the first marijuana ETF (TSX: HMMJ) hit the Canadian market back in April 2017, we witness some smaller names in the portfolio getting pushed up 20% in the week following the launch. And HMMJ marked the top net inflow ETF in Canada in 2017.",2018-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7vtmry/the_right_time_to_by_this_blockchain_stock_tsxv/

""Arcology founder and leader, Mr. Laurent Zhang, has invented a radically new way of looking at blockchain. Leveraging his experience with machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data algorithmic analysis, he is creating a hierarchical structure that is self-organizing and self-repairing.""

This certainly seems to have enough big words to hype but as I understand it (disclaimer I'm not an IT guy so for me it's just the basics) this could cut the time needed for transaction-processing which is right now breaking bitcoin and to a degree ethereum (as I said very basic understanding, feel free to correct me please).

Has anyone looked at this before? I'm torn... I don't quite believe in them there seems to be something missing...

Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Innovus Pharma"" or the “Company”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV), an emerging commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that delivers safe, innovative and effective over-the-counter medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women's health and respiratory diseases, today announced that the human clinical trial for the patented formulation in its product UriVarx® product for bladder health was published in the peer reviewed journal, BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Schoendorfer et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:42). The study was conducted by the team of Dr. Niikee Schoendorfer in Australia in collaboration with the Company’s UriVarx® licensing partner Seipel Group, Ltd. The outcome of this study demonstrated both statistical significance and clinical relevance in reducing symptoms of Overactive Bladder (“OAB”), urinary frequency and/or urgency and incontinence.

In this study, one hundred and fifty participants (59% female, aged; mean ± SD; 63.5 ± 13.1 years) took part. At week 8, urinary day frequency was significantly lower (OR 0.01; 95%CI 0.01 to 0.02; p &lt; 0.001) in response to treatment (mean ± SD; 7.69 ± 2.15/day) compared to placebo (10.95 ± 2.47/day). Similarly, episodes of nocturia were significantly fewer (OR 0.03; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.05) after 8 weeks of treatment (2.16 ± 1.49/night) versus placebo (3.14 ± 1.36/night). Symptoms of urgency (OR 0.02; 95%CI 0.01 to 0.03), and total incontinence (OR 0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06) were also lower (all p &lt; 0.01) in the treatment group. Significant improvements in quality of life were reported after treatment in comparison to placebo. No significant side effects were observed resulting in withdrawal from treatment.

“We are very happy with the publication of the strong clinical data on the patented formulation in our best-selling product, UriVarx® for bladder health” stated Dr. Bassam Damaj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Innovus Pharma. “The publication of the clinical trial gives a tremendous boost to the clinical credibility of this product and we hope will translate into increased sales of this product from consumers who want a product for this disease indication that is scientifically sound and clinically-tested,” he continued.
