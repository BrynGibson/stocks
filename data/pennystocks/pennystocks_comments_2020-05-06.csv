Here are a few pump indicators as well:
- look for an ascending stairstep candles with higher than average volume over extended range.
- look for a series long wick (dip buying) candles at a bottom
- buy an offering on tiny market cap stock with greasy tutes like Sabby, Empery, CVI, Hudson Bay and wait for them to pump the price to warrant strike

It also lets you decided how many shares you want to sell at that point. You can also do a trailing stop limit which allows you to sell at a percentage of the highest price that day, which is useful if you won’t be able to track it continuously. For example let’s say MVIS hits $2 but starts cratering tomorrow, and you don’t want to wait to see how low it drops, you could set a trailing stop limit that would sell for you at 15 or 20%, for 15% it would trigger a sell at 1.7, which would allow you to make more profit than if you had kept it at 1.4 without having to keep monitoring it.

184,wildsidewalk,fpnieoe,/r/pennystocks/comments/geh9w2/a_few_questions_from_a_struggling_newbie/fpnieoe/,1,"Disclaimer: I got into short-term trading only in the last two months. Before that, I stuck to long-term holds and was a set-it-and-forget-it investor. This is just what I've learned as someone who was in a similar position to you not long ago. Take that for what it's worth.

&gt;-How much do you pay attention to the RSI vs price movement?

I find the RSI and [stochastic oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) charts to be useful in understanding price movements and momentum. In ToS, I have 4 sections of my Charts tab:

1) Standard candle trend style for whatever time period I'm analyzing

2) VolumeAvg chart

3) RSI chart

4) Stochastic oscillator chart

&gt;-How many stocks do you trade at a time?

For day/swing trading, between 1 and 8 at any given time. Most of my overall portfolio is long-term holds in blue chip stocks and index funds, so I'm not counting those. 8 is not a hard limit for me btw, it's just the most I've ever played with simultaneously. Some of those were pretty small positions though. 

&gt;-In such a weird market as the current one, how much would you say trading is strategy vs gambling?

I tried my hand at options during the last two months, and that felt like legit gambling. I don't touch options now except for covered calls. 

You'll always have some risk and uncertainty in trading stocks, more so in penny stocks, but there's no reason you can't ride the trends day-to-day with an informed investment strategy. Use the stochastic oscillator to understand when a stock is oversold and in one of its bottoms then ride it back up to its next peak and sell when it's overbought. Will it always go back up? Not necessarily, that's the risk you take, but if you buy when a stock is oversold, it's more likely to rise from that point than to continue going down.

Stocks are constantly move like this, and you don't have to make these plays on penny stocks. Netflix is a decent example. Ignore the fundamental analysis for a second and just look at their price charts. Ever since the market bottom in March, it's been on a bullish climb with ups and downs along the way. On April 9th, my stochastic chart was saying buy buy buy because the stock was oversold, and on April 12th, it was saying sell sell sell because the stock was overbought. 

If you don't want the risk/reward ratio of penny stocks, then day/swing trade something like Netflix. In a worst case scenario, you could still hold it long-term and probably come out on top in the end. Or if you miss the overbought peak to sell, wait for the next peak because there likely will be one as the stock cycles. 

&gt;-What helped you the most when you first started as a trader?

1) Putting in the effort to understand charts, trends and data. There are so many Youtube tutorials on ToS, day/swing trading in general, etc. that are worth your time. I spent probably two weeks just getting lost in them. 

2) Talking about it. IMO, the more you try to explain your investment strategy or aspects of the stock market, the better you understand it yourself. 

3) Making mistakes and being okay with that. Without getting too much into cliche territory, just know that you will win and you will lose, but if you learn from mistakes and constantly absorb as much knowledge as possible, you will win more than you lose over time.",2020-05-06

This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme this is something investors do all the time. It's an opportunity and there are no guarantees how much it will be worth. Could make a dollar could make a fortune. That will depend on how much it tanks post split. This is an oil at an all-time low though this is a company that has consistently failed at every turn.

Somebody on this sub mentioned they foresaw heavy resistance around the .82 mark and they were spot on. I may even be too optimistic with my $1.00 target. 

Based on my observations with MVIS I think people are going to be very cautious and sell off earlier, well before the webinar. Lots of people got burned from UAVS by waiting until the meeting including me. It changed my approach to ride the hype up and then jump off before there is fear. 

I think some people that got in at the .30s already sold off today for some good gains. I could have bought in last night at .36 and i'm kicking myself for not doing that. I just hope that it has not peaked already today.",2020-05-06

At this point, I'm just riding out the earnings call. The stock got f\*cked by loads of hype and fake news pump &amp; dumps, but that doesn't take away from the generally solid company that MVIS is. People are spooked by recency - DECN and UAVS were ugly, and the fat whale piss was the last straw. The company won't tank if Microsoft doesn't end up acquiring it.

In the event that the stock tanks after the earnings call, I'll just long hold this stock. I personally don't believe it's a $0.20 company (do your own, accurate DD outside of Reddit). 

There will be upswings in the future, so I'd rather hold than lock in my loss now. I'm past the cash-out time, so it's a different strategy here on out.

Good luck all!",2020-05-06

1. FOMO buying is real. As AH creeps, FOMO buyers should inflate the price some more in anticipation of the call tomorrow. The price is low enough to entice those on the fence.
2. Big players can shake things up. It may be low enough for big players to want to play. Not a big loss for them since the price dipped, but the upside can be great. 
3. MVIS isn't a shitty company. There may have been a lot of pump &amp; dump fake news, but the company itself isn't a $0.20 company. It has solid patents and products, and a long partnership with Microsoft. Even without an acquisition, this company isn't going to tank out of nowhere.

For those who bought in the sub $1.00 prices, sell some for a profit then hold the rest. The upside is real!

For those who bought too high, you may as well hold for the best. AH has treated this stock very well the past few nights. If anything, sell tomorrow morning.",2020-05-06

If you want to jump on the pump and dump shuttle to the moon, you need to do it before it's too high or else you'll try too hard, you'll jump from the highest point you can to try to reach something to grab on, end up falling and hurting yourself.
So you want to be in the shuttle before it goes or at least jump soon enough to grab something, assuming you are the superhero I mention earlier and survive the stratosphere and lack of air...
Anyway

The average of the frequencies above is 12.5 when taking MVIS and IZEA in consideration, without them it's 6.7...
It's too late to buy them (unless we are really feeling them in the long term, but, who are we kidding) MVIS as been testing investors faith since  20 years and I do feel for the guy who bought them over 400$ early 2000, telling himself, this is it, the breaktrough I was waiting for!
(You can assume that the top of the frequency chart is the too late section for the short run)


You want something you are gonna sell in 1-2 days, when adrenalina kicks in your veins realising you don't know what you're doing and you should sell while you're up.

So instead of looking at the stocks at the top of the frequency chart, maybe look at the stocks that yesterday were mentioned 3-4 times and today 8-9 times, not only the increase in frequency should indicate what stocks are really trending in terms of % but also which one went from below to over average and by how far and focus on the pre-MARK(too far up from 'real average'(if I may call this real average(I know I can't, I am not an academic(sorry for the meta-parenthesis))))

2. NEVER SELL AN OPTION. BUY THEM AND THEN SELL THE ONES YOU'VE BOUGHT. IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY BUY A NAKED OPTION AND YOU CAN'T COVER IT CONGRATS YOU NOW OWE ANYWHERE FROM 10S OF THOUSANDS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN DEBT. GO BUY ROPE.
3. Options are essentially I think the stock is up or down for calls or puts respectively. Since were only buying and never selling we would buy a put or call if we think the stock is going down or up respectively.
4. The number on the option is called the strike price. This is what you think the stock will hit by X date.
5. Rule of thumb is always buy options month out unless you're doing risky plays such as earnings. This is because of the Greeks on options. I'm not discussing gi read. This will trash the value of your options the last week before expiry.
6. If your option is otm. Meaning it didnt hit the strike it expires worthless meaning you lost all your money. Or if it's itm you have the option to buy or sell at that strike price respectively for whatever option.
7. But nobody ever really does this. People trade options back and forth profiting off the premiums rather than the strikes and exercising. Hence this post.

Idk how I feel about it to date still. My experience and my research doesn't feel as bullish I was in 2016 at the current state of the company and state of the mine. Am thinking of buying back into NAK below $.75 though, solely due to the fact that the guy that was in charge of the EPA is not the same as the guy in 2016-2017.

I am definitely not buying back into it but if you are a bag holder then there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.

First, I would be cautious with penny stocks. Definitely play around with the $700 though to get the feel. Also, figure out what your goal is. OPTION 1) If your making a consistent income, consider buying dividend stocks. 
If you’re unfamiliar with the idea, you invest a starting capital, and you take a small chunk from each paycheck, and add it to the investment. Whatever your able to part with, $50-$100-$500. Then, depending on the stocks, you get paid roughly every 3 months, just for holding shares of the company. And then you take those dividends, and reinvest, while you keep adding a small chunk from your paycheck, and eventually you’ll have a steady stream of dividends. 
This will definitely take a while to get rolling, unless you start with a huge chunk of capital. But it is extremely easy, and predictable, provided you invest in good strong companies.
OPTION 2) the somewhat faster but riskier method, would be trying to buy a stock that you think will jump up. Since almost every Stock is at least buy one get one free right now, you have lots of options. If you can invest $10,000 in a stock that you might believe, will return to normal in a year or so, then you’ll definitely make your money back and then some.
The only issue is that many companies don’t know if they’ll make it through the current pandemic and following recession.
PM if you wanna chat. I am by no means an expert, but definitely in a similar situation and I’ve been researching the best things for several months now and maybe we can bounce ideas and experiences off one another.

Then when you get a list of like 20-30 stocks start checking the news. Is there is in fact good news?

Ex.)

FDA approval, crushed earnings, huge new contract,  breakthrough technology, CURE FOR COVID-19!!!

Whatever the news. Then look at chart. You want to see a chart with room to explode up with little resistance. If it already broke a multi-day/month resistance that’s great!! 

Put on watchlist (don’t buy yet). Then when the stock dips or seems like it’s going to break a high of day or multi-day resistance you slam the buy button. Now at this point volume shouldn’t be too crazy yet. So once you hold for a while and see signs that you should exit. Get out. 

Exit indicators: Huge volume spikes, approaching a resistance level, breaking below a moving average, a megathread has been created, etc.

After I was convinced by MVIS I did some of my own research and decided to buy in 1000 at 0.41. Same story with IZEA. Don’t just look at what’s hot atm search for future and upcoming trades so you can execute them later. Right now I am looking at RTTR, AQST, still IZEA, and ALPP. They all have news for the future. 

RTTR for example dropped 30% today which you could just disregard as a failing penny stock. Or if you do some research on it, they have some small news in the next week or so. So this is how you can see where the hype will be, before the hype happens. Not saying it’s the next hot stock; but it’s a possibility you got to keep on your radar.

The truth is; you’re not really searching for something great for the company in the future (Like the talk about MVIS being bought out by MSFT).

You’re searching for where the hype WILL be in the near future and ride the gain. (Like last week there were just small rumors about MVIS and MSFT, as the rumor grew so does the chances of the price to shoot up.) If it convinces YOU enough that the sheep will buy in take a position.

We can see this by noticing that tomorrow is when  the actual announcement is for MVIS; but for now the price already peaked. It’s all about finding where the hype will be.

Remember these are penny stocks so once you see gains, dump it. Better to make a profit than be negative.

The only one responsible for your trades is you as always.

I've been investing conservatively since I was about 23 (I'll be 29 next week) BUT if I could go back, I'd save up buy a duplex, have passive in come keep/sell.

2) reconsider that house budget. Get a 225k something with your 120k down payment, if you kick ass at trading and your income goes from 35k to 75k in 2 years then you can rent out the house you have paid off. Now you have 3 income streams. 

Are you in a position to have roommates? Save up for your next place while they pay your house off

3) how insulated are you from risk? 

Do you have 3-6 months of living expenses? What would a 600k house do to that? Here’s a hot take- Use a Roth IRA as a base for your emergency fund 

Also what’s your rainy day fund? Get 1-2k in a Capital one 360 savings account for life’s bullshit

What’s your analysis competency?

The charts foretold it long before people started hyping it.

All of these tickers were in a volatility squeeze for days or sometimes even weeks before they started flying.

I was in UAVS and VISL. Lost money on VISL, made money on UAVS. Learned some lessons - including bolstering my TA - and then I saw MVIS.

Someone offhandedly mentioned it in a Discord server I frequent. I charted that lil' baby. Checked all the indicators, found a pattern, and then topped it off by searching out the web and saw some scattered chatter about it.

I bought in at 0.29 and so did many other people in my server, because after all of my findings, I started pushing the MVIS envelope HARD. Most of us sold well over a dollar. We're happy here, right now.

TA can be a helpful determinant in these sorts of things, too. Combining that with some good old fashioned research is a fantastic way to be ahead of the market instead of simply walking alongside it.

Information is power.

Many posts are actually fraud but many people don't detect it. People, who have a vested interest in driving the price up, will deliberately buy upvotes to push their agenda. Also general morons who echo those who are more persuasive then them. 

Remember, almost all these traders lose. They keep putting their money down on these ""next big things."" Haven't they read a book? That never ends well in any story. Let alone one driven by total mania.

Many ""to the moon"" and ""lambo"" posts I suspect were placed by people much smarter than you may believe. Some are genuinely morons, and others are wolves in sheeps clothing.

Do I always get that? No. 

Do I hit that goal frequently? Yes. Probably 3 out of 5 times a week.

Do I ever take losses? Yes, but I minimize it to 1% or less, and I make sure that it only comes out of my profits and never my principal, so that, in a certain sense, I never truly take a loss.

How? Once I hit the amount of money I want to make, I scalp the asset(s) and enjoy the rest of my day. Sometimes this looks like playing 3-5 assets at a time, sometimes just one. If I make $20-30 on 3-5 stocks, boom, I've hit my goal. If it's one that I expect to increase 20%+ in a short period of time, that may be my main play for the day. My belief, though, is that if something can rocket up that fast, it can easily go down just as quickly, so I avoid going all in and only put less than 20% of my buying power** to manage risk.

NB: I'm generally working with $5k-10k at a given time. I make withdrawals of my profits to pay the bills, pay down debt, buy groceries, etc. Since I'm profitable, it helps me support my family.",2020-05-06

&gt;*Once the circuit breaker is tripped, short-sale orders can only be executed at a price higher than the current best bid. You can’t ‘hit the bid’ on a short-sale order with a stock under SSR. Which means you have to wait for the price to go up to your ask price for the order to execute.*

&gt;Following on with the example…

&gt;*The hypothetical stock drops all the way to 85 cents a share from the previous day’s close at $1.00. You’ve been waiting for a big crack to happen right around 85 cents. You’re sure when it breaks through 85 cents it’s bye-bye time for this stock. You’ve created a trading plan.*

&gt;*Under the short-sale rule, if the best bid is 85 cents you can’t short at 85 cents. You have to put in your short-sale order at a price higher than the bid. A bid for your (higher) ask price has to come through for the order to get executed. So, it’s still an uptick rule. In that respect, it’s similar to the original SSR.*",2020-05-06

It seems like they’ve been throwing away fistfuls of cash at their shareholders lately with dividends of 4.25 and 1.00 in November and April, respectively. 

It doesn’t seem like a shining star other than that though. Their revenue of $42 million is down a lot as of December, -77%, but they have a lot of cash on hand, $116.24 million. Share price has been dropping steadily for the last two years from 24. It doesn’t make any sense to me how they can give money away like that, but i can’t find a reason to disbelieve it.

Anyone who played EFT knows what I'm talking about. The population grew so large and fast after they partnered with a handful of streamers that the game servers ended up overloaded for months lol.
* Again I have no idea what IZEA is doing on twitch in particular, but its hard to fuck up advertising and exposure on twitch. Plus they have good companies they ""represent"" and the product is solid in this day and age. Marketing/twitch/advertisements/influencers are going to the moon for the next...10 years? Who knows. Shit, just knowing they represent a company I work for makes me want to reach out and get ""paired up!"" on twitch with my company haha.
* **I don't know shit about charts**, but their financials kind of scare me.

“Consider the following real-life event: On December 4, 2006, Station Casinos received a buyout offer from its management for $82 per share. The change in the value of the option on that day indicates that some option holders fared well, while others took hits. Case in point: on that day, options expiring on January 9, 2007, with a strike price of $70--well below the $82 offer price, rose from $11.40 to $17.30, representing a whopping 52% increase. In contrast, those same options with a strike price of $90--well above the $82 offer price, fell from $3.40 to $1.00, representing a staggering 71% loss.”

Two things I like to pay attention to when it comes to the tanker stocks is the the surplus of oil relative to available storage and the price of oil. The closer we close the gap between oil surplus and available storage, the worse for oil tanker stock prices. Regarding the price of oil and tanker stocks, it seems as the price of WTI crude or Brent goes up, oil tanker stock prices go down - and right now it’s going up. I also don’t think the windfall from the increase storage revenues will be that great to allow them to pay dividends, invest in new technologies, significantly reduce debt, etc. Keep in mind this storage issue really became an issue starting mid-late April.

You could make a lot of money pretty steadily just buying low and selling high. Then you can optimize it to get premiums from calls and puts and such depending on which way the stock moves. Create one cancels the other orders when dealing with canceling call orders because a trailing stop loss order and so on. Or hell just buy a decently reviewed Electronic Advisor and let it do it's thing. I see no reason I should actually have to do all the trading myself.

In fact, on page 22 of the presentation, they state ""We do not anticipate issuing any more equity for the foreseeable future"".

BBCP issued the Zero-Dividend Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock in Dec 2018 as part of the business combination closing.  Notice that the amount of shares, 2.450,980 is the same number used in the presentation, and in very small print on page 35, under the graphic showing the Zero-Dividend Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. it says ""Note: Preferred stock is held by Nuveen"".

Nuveen has the option to exchange that stock for BBCP common at any time. IF BBCP elects to redeem the stock, they will have to pay a 7% per year interest fee: 

""On December 6, 2018, the closing date (the “Closing”) of the Company’s business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Industrea Acquisition Corp. (“Industrea”), pursuant to that certain subscription agreement, dated as of September 7, 2018, by and between the Company and Nuveen Alternatives Advisors, LLC, on behalf of one or more funds or accounts (“Nuveen”), the Company issued to Nuveen 2,450,980 shares of the Company’s Series A Zero-Dividend Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) at a price of $10.20 per share, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $25.0 million. The Series A Preferred Stock will not pay dividends and will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a 1:1 ratio (subject to customary adjustments) at any time following six months after the Closing. We will have the right to elect to redeem all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Stock at our election after four years for cash at a redemption price equal to the amount of the principal investment plus an additional cumulative amount that will accrue at an annual rate of 7.0% ""

""Someone mentioned TLSS, and after light legwork I hopped in. They are a shipping company who works on the final leg of delivery (warehouse to door). They have debt, but earlier this year they were around $4 a share. Now? .03 cents. Full earnings next week, already announced a preliminary %49 increase in revenue for 2020 Q1 over Q1 2019, and Q1 2019 was 1/3rd their profits for the year in 2019. I see no reason for them to be this low, especially since they have engaged in, this year alone:

Debt restructuring
Business operation expansion
Cost of operation reduction

They work with Amazon, but I they are a sma leg in the Amazon chain, and likewise Amazon i believe is a small portion of their income. It seems likely with the business boom in e-commerce they expanded with Amazon, but likely only slightly as Amazon seems to be a place that likes to keep cash flow in house.""",2020-05-06

I had a stock that had a unanimous advisory board approval and it tripled in price on approval. I had another one that had a unanimous advisory board approval vote and did literally nothing. If you can read the data from phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials and weed through fluff and whatever, and you think a medication/treatment will get the advisory board O.K., then buy before advisory meeting. But if you piggy-back off asvisory board recommendations you could make some money, or make nothing. Keep in mind market share for a treatment too -- peanut allergy has a lot of business in it; a golden goose for MS is more likely to pop. 

The advisory board is a panel of experts who meet and provide a recommendation to the FDA for approval/rejection. The FDA is NOT bound by the advisory board, but i they usually follow their recommendations/reach a decision that concurs with the advisory panels choice. I think they ""go against"" advisory board about %20 of the time, so its rare (%80 in accordance with advisory panel is pretty solid).

Please note, I'm only talking from what minor experience I have. Do you own research, DD, and if you find anything I left out, or find something I'm wrong about, or learn something I did not mention, please reply to this comment so I can learn from your experience just as I am trying to help you learn from mine.

maybe they plan on holding longer than you plan on holding and know that after the dip would be huge gains. And since they’re posting about, they slresdy have their positions locked in, so even with a -12% they could still be green.

Note that an FDA approval has a deadline, but it can come earlier. They can also get rejected earlier. The dates set in stone are trial dates and advisory board. Those dates get moved, but you won't get surprised by an early positive or negative. You could have things like: phase 2 failed to reach primary endpoint, or advisory board meeting pushed back to provide time for more data, etcetera. Its a different kind of news, but effectively I suppose its the same as an early approval/rejection.

Full earnings next week, already announced a preliminary %49 increase in revenue for 2020 Q1 over Q1 2019, and Q1 2019 was 1/3rd their profits for the year in 2019. I see no reason for them to be this low, especially since they have engaged in, this year alone:

Debt restructuring
Business operation expansion
Cost of operation reduction

They work with Amazon, but I they are a sma leg in the Amazon chain, and likewise Amazon i believe is a small portion of their income.

I watched the tech demo and its still janky the tech isn't there yet but its a huge step forward.

The first would be to analyze what happened during your play and why you lost money. The second would be to not play these kinds of bets with so much capital. I've got $1035 initial investment averaged to 900 shares. I am prepared to lose 100% of that at all times. Happened with DECN, it can happen here, however unlikely as MVIS seems to be actually quite a reputable company. So with such good looking company and all the amazing rumors, patents, employee poaching, videos with visuals of MVIS tech on the hololens, etc, a stop loss may have been a bad idea when you're investing that much money. If you lost 50k then you must have been riding on a lot of shares. The methodology for hedging those shares is different when you play with that much money. A potential idea that may have worked to avoid the stop hunter would have been to sell calls on your shares. Then when dips like that occur you can hedge your losses by buying the calls back at a lower price this reducing the amount of damage the stop hunter does to your equity. Think of it almost like an RPG, honestly. There's always a way to win. You just have to be smarter than the big fish expect you to be.",2020-05-06

They have their earnings reports coming up, FDA submission for their TSC treatment to ARDS, which is for pneumonia and oxygen deprivation related shit which are directly symptoms of covid 19, therefore their submission was eligible for the FDAs fasttrack program(TPAP I think its called). 

Meanwhile DFFN has already been conducting their trials which were meant to be rapid in the first place, which so far have shown success or no abnormal results, not only in the US but also Europe, which can also be a catalyst. 

Cicero posted some fucking solid ass DD on DFFN the other day. Idk how to link it otherwise I would. 

Pumped to .70 cents with news yesterday regarding eligibility of said fastracking program, back down to .50 cents rn. Momentum+Volume building up slowly. 

Such an easy steal rn. My average is at .60 wish I had more funds to put in but have to wait till they settle on robinhood. DFFN will be at $1 easy IMO, analysts say $3.50. I'm thinking all within a couple weeks, max 1 month.

I think I lost like 10-15 dollars on absolute ass trades before I started seeing any money back. Then the biggest tip? Hop on the pump and dumps when they come along. Don't get greedy and go for the big profits but get like 20-50% and step out. Probably the biggest thing after that would be to learn to read a chart if you havent. Even if you dont learn to recognize patterns, seeing how volume and price increases/decreases correlate and knowing where resistance and support points are cannbe so incredibly helpful.

4967,Agent_XLII,fqxnpdf,/r/pennystocks/comments/gemr6p/gnus_genius_brands_international_to_launch/fqxnpdf/,2,"  This might get long winded but I like this company a lot. I bought in at 1.57 (which is almost the one year high), and again at 1.30. No regrets. I think this has huge upswing potential. A couple of criticisms and risks but a lot of silver lining too. 

  They have talented management and an experienced board. 

  Andy Heyward, CEO has had a hand in creation or writing of some pretty well known brands: Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear, Flinstones, Jetsons, and Smurfs  with Hanna-Barbera and Inspector Gadget, Ghostbusters, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Hello Kitty, Sonic the Hedgehog, G.I Joe, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Care Bears, and several others. On top of being in a gazillion societies and earning numerous awards.

  I'm also a fan of Jamie Buono-Sikorski, VP of marketing....major player in the product marketing of Bandai's Power Rangers toys which routinely hit annual sales figures above 100 mil and later became global brand manager of a company called Spin Master who own this little ip you might have heard of called Paw Patrol.

  Board member Margarey Ann Loesch started her career at ABC and subsequently NBC, Hanna-Barbera, Fox Kids, then Jim Henson productions where she was promoted to CEO of the Odyssey network and played a role in the sale and rebranding to Hallmark as the Hallmark Channel.


  And the rest of upper management is just as impressive. In short, it's a very talented and diverse group who have proven track records of success with brand building.


  According to the recent shareholders letter, their new network Kartoon Channel will be completely free to view, ad supported, and be available over 100 million households and 200 million devices. That's an insane level of distribution on day one. I do worry about the free, ad supported model. Barring a second wave of corona virus related shut-ins, I think they may have missed the apex point of what they could have made in ad revenue already. I'm not sure how much companies make in ad revenue but it is tied heavily to viewer engagement. With our kids' collective attention spans, a never ending supply of alternatives, and the fact that we've all been shut in for a couple of months, it just seems like a bad model at a bad time.

   The company could have a better debt to equity ratio, I believe it's around .74 right now. Being pessimistic and cutting the potential mobile capacity in half, that still leaves 200mil potential paid streams. Even if they charged a paltry 2.99/mo and converted an abysmal . 01% of that 200m that's still 2m paid subscribers in month one. Or 5.9 million dollars which equates to the previous years entire earnings. And more than enough to shore up debt and allotment for ""general corporate purposes"" or investments into current or new projects.

  The real thing to get excited about is the merchandising deal with Mattel. The viewership ratings and engagement within the target demographic for Rainbow Rangers just keeps going up. Mattel is still a large toy manufacturer perfectly competent enough to keep up with virtually any realistic demand expectations. This may wind up being more lucrative for the company than the new channel.

I could be wrong but I strongly suspect a lot of volatility over the next few weeks before a pretty large and hopefully continuous upswing. Especially if these projects hit the way that they could.",2020-05-06

5594,DormantTitan,fpo2a7d,/r/pennystocks/comments/gekmqg/isnt_mvis_still_releasing_news_tomorrow_after/fpo2a7d/,1,"First off I will reiterate, I have no position in this stock and this is purely speculation so do with that what you may. 

I believe there are two stories going on here, there’s hype around stock ticker “MVIS” and there is hype around Microvision as a company. I make this distinction because there are people who know nothing or don’t care what Microvision does further than their news tomorrow and what the stock is at (aka 90% of this sub), and there are people who believe in the company and what their Hologen tech could mean in a year or two (aka r/MVIS). That being said, it is worthwhile hype on both fronts as the potential news to come could be promising for investors and people in the tech field.

Now, yesterday a big player with about 700k shares forced a stop sell run (I won’t go into details here but basically they rightly guessed a bunch of people had auto-sell around a certain price and forced the drop with a single high volume trade that dominoed). To the first group of speculators, the ones that only care about the ticker price and not about the company, this huge dip showed just how volatile this stock is and they’re panicking, trying to get out of their position because they probably bought too high. The TEC placed a stop on short sells so now the only mass sell offs come from people that have been holding since yesterday. As people buy back today at a lower price to average out their position, it’ll rise again.. but not with the same mania as yesterday morning when it seemed it was gonna ride straight and narrow until thursday. 

At this point in time I feel that the majority of shareholders are waiting till they see a certain margin return (15-20%) and have sell off contracts ready to trigger. If you’re asking me, this is the best course of action.. depending on where you go in.

Do your research, guesstimate where the majority of people might have gotten in yesterday (ie 1.50) and add 20% to that (1.80). That’s likely where the next big dip will happen today as people sell off for good. Your risk tolerance will determine how close you want to get to that point. Personally I would focus on getting out today at a good price, AH and PM will likely be wild tonight and tomorrow as hype for the diehard gamblers peaks, might be too late to get out by then.",2020-05-06

Some general advice I can offer would be to keep your emotions in check and make the best decisions you can based on your own personal level of knowledge and experience.

It's okay (although not ideal) to follow the pack when a certain stock starts creating a lot of buzz. Just remember not to invest money that you can't afford losing. 

Use a questioning attitude and avoid falling prey to confirmation bias. Case in point, UAVS. I warned people that the video that surfaced with the Ag Eagle logo next to an Amazon logo doesn't prove a partnership is in the works. Well, that didn't go over well with a few people who wanted to believe a partnership was imminent. 

Finally, this should be fun and exciting! If you're constantly stressed and don't know what to do (when to buy, when to sell), sit it out for a bit. Catch up on some reading about investing, follow discussions on forums. 

I hope this doesn't come across as a lecture. Just trying to offer some of my thoughts which I keep in mind throughout the process.",2020-05-06

And there seems to be a large number of unsuspecting newcomers here that don't know any better. It is gross, like you say.

Also the pinnacle of the delusion for me is that ""This is why MVIS dipped"" thread, outlining some master plan of the whale to buy back in at a cheaper price, when the reality is he just dumped to take his profit and gtfo. He didn't even have enough faith to set a limit order and wait to get filled, but instead dumps it all in one market order.

When it comes to securing your 50% profit, the goal with moderate/high risk is to have more ""freeroll"" shares going into Step 3 because you're waiting for a higher sell price to gain your 50% profit. So, say you want to retain 20% of shares versus 10% going into step 3, you'd have to wait for your share price to double. Perhaps for moderate you'd set your share retention to 15% of total initial shares. These numbers are just examples and aren't set in stone.

Extreme risk is simply buying a stock and letting it ride with no set guidelines. Essentially, you're trying to time the market. 

A good exercise after you've sold a position is to calculate how much you made using a conservative approach versus a higher risk approach. At times, the amount you stand to gain with a high risk approach can be fairly significant but may not be aligned with a person's risk tolerance level. Basically, it might not be worth chasing every possible dollar.",2020-05-06

5839,AliveAndWellness,fpodlnf,/r/pennystocks/comments/gel4w2/personal_strategy_for_buying_selling_stocks/fpodlnf/,1,"This is an example to illustrate the main differences between my low, moderate and high risk strategies. The variable for each is level of share retention going into step 3.

So, say I own 1000 @ 1, of stock 'X'

Step 1:
Sell 666.66 (round down to 666) @ 1.5 = 999 USD, to cover initial purchase price (same approach as low risk strategy).

Step 2:
333 shares remaining of 1000 after selling 666.

Calculate your desired level of share retention going into step 3. This will determine your sell price in step 2 to acquire your 50% of total initial purchase price profit. 

Percentage of total initial share amount (1000):

Low Risk: 10% = 100
Moderate Risk: 15% = 150
High Risk: 20% = 200

50% profit = 500 USD

For 10% share retention (Low Risk), subtract 100 from 333 shares remaining: 
Sell 233 @ 2.15 = 500.95 USD. You'll have 100 shares remaining to freeroll through step 3.

For 15% share retention (Moderate Risk), subtract 150 from 333 shares remaining: 
Sell 183 @ 2.73 = 499.59 USD. You'll have 150 shares remaining to freeroll through step 3.

For 20% share retention (High Risk), subtract 200 from 333 shares remaining: 
Sell 133 @ 3.76 = 500.08 USD. You'll have 200 shares remaining to freeroll through step 3.

As you can see, the main potential advantage for the moderate and high risk approaches is that you'll enter into step 3 with more shares. This can be beneficial if the stock price really takes off. 

The main potential disadvantage is having to wait for a higher price to be reached in order to secure a 50% profit in order to retain more shares. This is why I prefer my low risk approach. Lower sell point to secure a 50% of initial total purchase price for a profit.",2020-05-06

In all seriousness this is a pretty real tech company with a very specific niche they specialize in - pico projectors and pico mapping technologies. They're pretty legit and have some interesting patents all around. So, I used to work in the pico projector industry for a few years and we would tool and manufacture re-existing technologies. Microvision at the time was a startup in the space but they had some pretty impressive tech early on going so far to exhibit heads up displays with at-the-time pico projector tech, we're talking shit lumens like 80 lumens which is nothing modern projectors do like 2k+. So, now they have components in one of the most interesting technology products and platforms i've seen in years (holy shit VR looks like a toy now), produced by one of the largest technology manufacturers in the world in America, and they're ramping up production with military orders ready to go.

A discounted one is TradingView. Good for scanners/chart tools. But you can use anything you want even yahoo finance for scanning and charts. I would always recommend investing in tools bc they give you a huge advantage; however, if you are new don’t bother yet. 

You should google and YouTube some webinars about support/resistance and how to read volume. I could truly go on all day and I am no master. You should study a bit and take notes bc with just those indicators you will go from freshman to sophomore very quickly. 

All these things can be seen on a basic candlestick chart from yahoo finance or wherever.

A stock price with sudden changes like that of IZEA, MVIS, UAVS would be ideal candidates. 

I made this strategy to have a predetermined strategy to set into motion if one (or more) of my holdings were to take off, rather than play it by ear.

Example. 10:1 reverse. Current share price is $1.00/share. 

If you had 300 shares today, after the reverse split takes effect, you have 30. 

Now, the price per share also has a similar effect. It should revert to $10/share. However, the price is the gamble. It may stay. It may grow. It may collapse.

If they announce earnings release on Friday it will probably run to .02 in advance of earnings. If they don’t announce at least $2M in realized revenue for Q1 it will tank.

""**Liquidity and Going Concern**

The  Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using GAAP  applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of  assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow  from operations for most periods since its inception, which has resulted  in a total accumulated deficit of $60,384,769 as of December 31, 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a net loss of $7,290,120. The Company's cash balance as of December 31, 2019 was $5,884,629 and the Company's operating activities used cash of $2,905,485 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

With  the cash on hand and the Company’s planned operations in 2020 along  with its available credit line with Western Alliance Bank, the Company  expects to have sufficient cash reserves and financing sources available  to cover expenses at least one year from the issuance of this Annual  Report. However,  the Company has begun to see impacts on its operations due to changes  in advertising decisions, timing and spending priorities from customers  as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which will result in a  negative impact to Company sales. While the disruption is currently  expected to be temporary, there is uncertainty around the duration and  the total economic impact. Therefore, while the Company expects this  matter to negatively impact its business, results of operations, and  financial position, the full related financial impact cannot be  reasonably estimated at this time.""",2020-05-06

But, one of the biggest money makers for me was the food market and herbs.  What I would do is throw a few under cuts into the components (viper fish, etc) people would drop their prices to match mine. I would then throw a few under cut feasts out to ""crash"" the market. I would then buy out the feasts + baked portatos and bil tongs + their components and reset them all to triple/double value and sell of my stocks.    I'd pretty much do this over every weekend and then conclude on tuesdays and thursdays and then buy the dip again over friday. After a while I had enough resources to be able gate products at particular prices so that nobody could match my prices because they'd need to buy my inflated resource prices to make feasts that I sell 10-20% under value of the resources I pushed out on Fridays.   I would then make sure I bought all cloth under set margins so that my bags never dropped below 500-800.  In the event that they did I would pull out of the market and crash the cloth market to acquire more cheap cloth so that nobody else can craft bags at market value. This eventually reset the bags back to my price range where I would sell again.   One of my alternative methods was to put a product at a high margin while also selling the products that craft them at a premium of 15% more than the finished product costs to make. I would then get on an alt and talk about how well X is selling and they'd buy my resources to craft X. Then when the boom happens I turn around and undercut them forcing them to hold on to their product or take a loss because the cost to make + AH tax.  I ended up kicking two major goblins completely out of the market because they couldn't make sense of the shenanigans/ realizing I was nickle and diming them every step of the way.",2020-05-06
