27,turbonic1,flmh0f6,/r/pennystocks/comments/fpp762/want_to_be_a_part_of_a_short_squeeze/flmh0f6/,1,Price manipulation has been rampant with it for a long time by the Billionaires minions. For the most part shareholders know what they own and they are not selling. Especially so close to the trial date.  If you were to buy you would be very lucky to get shares between $10 and $12.  Most people that have been buying in the last month or two have been paying in the low to mid $20s. You do not need a lot of shares of this because the true value is not in trading it.  It‚Äôs in holding it for the outcome of the trial.  The share price right now only dictates how many shares you can get with your money.  I recommend TDameritrade to get shares. Robinhood cannot be used to get shares.,2020-03-27

The bid and the ask is inaccurate.  It‚Äôs been that way for a long time.  Did you read the Due Diligence information at InvestorsHub.com ?  You should read the ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù so you understand it all.  The Defendants created a very complex web of lies that you really need to understand because once you understand it you will understand the true potential of how much the damages could be.  Ultimately there will be a second trial after Sector 10 wins the first trial. The second trial will be a Federal RICO trial where then they can go after all of the companies and when they win the Federal RICO damages are automatically 2 or 3 times automatically in the favor of the winner.,2020-03-27

33,turbonic1,flmky8r,/r/pennystocks/comments/fpp762/want_to_be_a_part_of_a_short_squeeze/flmky8r/,1,Hello LaminateBody8. The trial is set for May 11th 2020 in Utah and is currently scheduled for 5 days.  The website went down a couple weeks ago by choice by Sector 10.  The domain is still paid for.  Shareholders believe they pulled it down possibly for a few reasons. They might be negotiating behind the scenes and part of that might be a Non Disclosure Agreement which pilling down the website would make sense.  The other idea is a few shareholders were asking them questions as to what exactly would happen if they won and that‚Äôs when the CEO tweeted to remain patient that the trial is imminent. The website or the share price do not effect the trial at all.  The trial is what is important after over a Decade of waiting for there day in court to prove they are the rightful owner of this technology.,2020-03-27

So registration as a b/d and membership of FINRA is a long, expensive and arduous process, and it subjects you to supervision and jurisdiction by FINRA. All those FINRA rules make it hard to unload all that stock quietly, which is a critical part of this dude's business model.

In this case Justin Keener has considerable form with FINRA already, having already refused to be subject to its jurisdiction back in 2012, and being pre-emptively barred forever from FINRA membership. He's been around the block for sure in penny-land.

2) Gonna need a compliant broker/dealer willing to take the attorney's opinion letters- also mentioned page 5( Keener also personally, or through employees acting at his direction, arranged for the converted stock to be transferred to his brokerage accounts either electronically or via mailed certificates. )

3) Gonna need a PR marketing campaign to create press releases and post on ihub etc o sucker in bagholders while you unload the stock. That's not mentioned at all in this complaint.

The paid for courses MIGHT help but I doubt there‚Äôs anything of substance you wouldn‚Äôt be able to find elsewhere for free. Just keep looking for info and read peoples opinions here on Reddit (but remember they‚Äôre just opinions). -YouTube also helps a lot too.

And for strategy, again, do some of your own research into it. Figure out what could work for you especially if you‚Äôre starting with a small amount. What strategies work for me might not give the same results for you.

Don‚Äôt get greedy either. As ‚Äúunenjoyable‚Äù as it is to make small, steady gains, you‚Äôll be much happier you didn‚Äôt take some big hit because you got greedy.

Learn from experience. Do your own research when you have question and don‚Äôt pay for courses unless you‚Äôre totally sold on it. Find what works for you for strategy. Don‚Äôt get greedy.",2020-03-27

Not only has Kenner affected the transactions of securities (penny stocks) qualifying him as a broker dealer, he has gone as far as creating a fake bussnise and employing up to 12 people to illegally work under his guidance, illegal because he is not registered, to buy and sell securities.

Each day that Kenner acted as a Broker Dealer is a separate offence with civil penalties up to $5,000, and he has been doing this for 3 years or ~1,100 days so he may owe up to $5,500,000 just for making as an unregistered broker dealer. 

Over those 3 year Kenner made over $21.5M I don't know if he has paid taxes or he may owe a lot for that as well.

I'm not sure what other penalties Kenner may acure, I havent even passes my series 65 exam yet (I was going to take it this week,but it was postponed do to the virus.)

As far as I can tell, aside from registering with the SEC, Kenner didn't do anything illegal.

He would buy convertable stock from new issuers.

Wait 6 months because there is a minimum time frame a Broker dealer must hold the stock if they got restrictes issues that were not avaulable to the public. (SEC Rule 144)

The value of that stock would almost always go down because most penny stocks are junk.

He would then convert the old stock for their new stock at a deal. Most of the time this was like selling back 1 old convertable stock for 1 new stock but he would get that new stock for 35-50% less than the lowest market value in the past month or so.

Finally, after converting the stock he would quickly sell it at market value and make profit on that 35-50% difference. 

Again, as far as I know the only offence was not registering, so I don't see why he didn't just register.

The SEC and FINRA take it VERY seriously when you're selling shares to the general public.

Repeated offenses can even land you in jail in addition to steep fines.

206,turbonic1,flny3f2,/r/pennystocks/comments/fpp762/want_to_be_a_part_of_a_short_squeeze/flny3f2/,1,Well i personally believe the stock will go up in stages.  The first big increase should go up when they win damages from the first lawsuit May 11th 2020. They are suing about 8 companies and individuals that were involved in the initial theft and also were involved in sabotaging the financing with Bank Of America and also with Moody‚Äôs Capital.  I think this will then open the door for the Federal RICO lawsuit against every other company and individual that is illegally using there technology. I think the stock will jump again once this is announced and then even higher once they win that Federal RICO lawsuit.  The Federal RICO lawsuit is where the maximum damages will be because when you win a Federal RICO lawsuit the damages are automatically by law either doubled or tripled sometimes to set an example to the public not to commit this type of a crime.   The company has very little debt and at some point once they win I am sure they will explore there options on how to make the stock more liquid with a forward split.  The only reason the did the reverse splits was to fend off the manipulation by the Billionaires. As long as they win the first trial which I highly encourage you to read all the due diligence information at InvestorsHub so you can understand what happened.  Then this stock should be a true unicorn story.,2020-03-27

You'd have 6000 shares at 10. Which you could hopefully sell today for a small profit lol. Thats averaging down. Not to worry though I'm sure itll go past your mark when the FDA approval comes.

If you want to talk more about it by phone about other details you probably do not know that I can share with you send me a private message and I can share some very interesting things with you.

You seem to be missing the point. I'm here to give honest feedback about someones post. It's how anyone perceives it, that's on them. 

&gt;I definitely trust DECN more then other companies, the PR news that they have, yes been sparingly releasing is still way more positive and with a greater overall long term outlook then a lot of these other test kits companies. DECN is headed in the right direction.

You seem overly long-biased, this will hurt your account long-term. It's not profitable long term. This random guessing, totally flipping a coin based on superstitions that the price will go up, will not work after a bigger sample size. I'm not against the stock, I'm against the way in thinking. It's why most traders fail. They are guessing and flipping a coin. 

My read on this stock is this:

* Generate hype based on coronavirus

* Hedge position by buying it up long

* Dump shares into retail traders

* Re-try pump to take out short stop orders (if any)

* Dump into retail again

* Slow bleed overtime

This is how this will play out. Check back in a year.",2020-03-27

I don‚Äôt know what you should do in this particular case with this particular stock, but generally speaking, learn your lesson and see how you can improve your risk management in the future. And try to stay away from penny stocks as much as possible.

If you wanna try to make it big with a smaller amount of cash, you might as well look into options. Options are a whole another way to blow up your account and require a solid amount of reading and understanding before spending real money on them... but once you do have that basic idea, at least you can play options with actual stocks or the indexes themselves (such as SP 500) and not have to deal with trash penny stocks.",2020-03-27

Since we're in penny stocks sub..

I'm in AYTU waiting for the relabeling of tests to complete and tests to make market and get some news. Added some so my buy is $1.51. Probably dump if they push $2.30, or at least trailing stop it.

CLNY I'm keeping a bit more long term as I think it will bounce back and start dividends again...

JDST trying for a short term gain, not sure how much it may go. Up a bit over 30% now.

NYMT and MFA I think will rebound once the larger settles and lenders catch up. Non conforming loans right now are dried up, so feel like they may get worse before better... If they do drop lower I may get a bit more.

Slightly larger in TTOO but bit nervous on that one.

Then have about 7 random fun stocks that probably won't do a thing, but all less than $100 thrown at it.

Once we get another big crash I'll move the bulk into long term relatively solid stocks aimed at retirement. Figure if Trump actually gets people out at Easter we'll have an even worse outbreak which would destroy market... I'm ok getting in after bottom vs risk of more.
