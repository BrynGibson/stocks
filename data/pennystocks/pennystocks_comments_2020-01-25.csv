I won‚Äôt say the name because i‚Äôm not trying to promote a stock i own but 2.5 years later i am still holding it, only because:

1)they do a good job keeping us informed, 
2)they meet deadlines and stick to their word
3)proving results
4) signing contracts with industry leaders (Air Canada)
5) financially backed by one of the big 3 canadian banks.
6) (most likely my downfall) i really like the innovative idea the company is trying to accomplish

After 2.5 years of holding they still have zero revenue from sales so as you can see any venture company with a plan to develop a product is a very long term process and requires financial support from a large institution, government permits which takes months to years to apply, test and get approval.. Also, i believe any ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô stock is a scam especially in the email security sector but that‚Äôs just me.. if it were the next amazon i‚Äôm sure they would have a large institution to back them financially and they wouldn‚Äôt use twitter and linkedin as a main source for marketing",2020-01-25
