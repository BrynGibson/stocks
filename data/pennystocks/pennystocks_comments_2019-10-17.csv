This is why people bet on the next Pfizer, because they perhaps conclude ""this drug is the next big thing and will STAY that way."" If you were an owner of this new game, why would you want to give anything to this small company named Esports entertainment group? Esports isn't proprietary like any of the actual sports, thus should be treated more as an entertainment service like Netflix. Then we'd need to say that this company is the one that'll make it, with 1/10,000+ odds, I'd say there's no chance. 

Since this company has been an OTC since 2011, and has had nothing going since, the odds diminish even lower. A wasted investment / trade IMO. No liquidity on this stock either, so short-term trading isn't applicable.",2019-10-17

1.  GMBL isn't a game publisher.  They are an esports betting platform, which means they thrive no matter what game or publisher is hot today, tomorrow and next year.
2. The shell has been around since 2011 but GMBL itself only became active in 2015 and launched its platform in 2018.  Since then, they have announced partnerships with over 190 esports teams that want their fans to use the GMBL platform for safety and revenue sharing.

Finally, take a look at the investment banks providing the majority of funding over the last 12 months and leading the S-1 + NASDAQ uplisting.

Much like Vegas that started out with mob money but eventually replaced by legit corporations, esports gambling is going through the same renaissance ... only much much faster.

Esports is attracting big investments from brands, wall street, team owners from other sports, celebrities, etc. .... which means gambling is and will flow into legitimate corporate entities such as GMBL.
