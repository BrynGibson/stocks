As usual I will mention hot to find biotech penny stocks with Finviz. It is very similar to filtering out all microcap stocks aka penny stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

In the video you as well hear a lot about biotech penny stocks fundamentals. You going to find out why most of the time small biotech stock companies do not produce ""real"" business. 

&amp;#x200B;

But never the less industry exists producing big pharma because from many few biotech companies gain insane percetages or a subject to merger or aquisition target.

&amp;#x200B;

As well you will find out about clinical researches and why it is important to know about them when speculating, trading or investing in biotech penny stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

You will get better idea what role FDA has in this industry.  

&amp;#x200B;

And in the end of the video I am going to share with you some great resource to use to your advantage when trading biotech penny stocks.

6,KULR Technology: Delivering Top-notch Thermal Management Solutions (OTCQB: KUTG),9gxit7,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9gxit7/kulr_technology_delivering_topnotch_thermal/,2,1," 

Just like the vehicles themselves, the electric vehicle (EV) market will only go as far as batteries take it.

That means that electric vehicle technology and battery technology are not just linked, they are one in the same – few advances in EVs will be possible without advances in batteries. Adding range, power, advanced cabin features, faster charging and enhanced safety all require better batteries.

That’s why the breakthrough work that **KULR Technology Group, Inc.** (OTCQB: KUTG) is doing is so vital to EVs and the market. In ongoing testing, KULR’s newly engineered carbon fiber cooling systems and materials co-designed with NASA for space flight are proving to make batteries not just more efficient but safer.

KULR’s core technology is a flexible and exceptionally lightweight fabric material that looks and feels like velvet but is made from pure carbon fiber – the most efficient conductor of heat energy on earth. For engineers and system designers the fiber’s flexibility, low contact pressure requirements, weight, and optimum cooling efficiency are game changers that allow them to manage or mitigate heat in ways that simply were not possible just a year ago.

For EVs, better heat management solutions are crucial because old legacy heat solutions such as fans, water pumps, reservoirs, and metal heat plates are heavy and bulky. When you’re burning gas perhaps hauling around 150 pounds of cooling pumps and fans doesn’t matter. But for EVs where less weight translates into more power and farther range, it really matters. And it’s not just for motors and drive components – KULR’s fiber solutions can manage the heat of the EV batteries themselves.

That’s a big deal because of the power demands that can consume an EV battery. Imagine, for example, starting your EV, in 110-degree desert heat, running the air conditioning, running satellite GPS and navigation systems and the drive train – all from a battery that, if it gets too hot, will just shut down, or worse. In conditions like that, keeping that battery cool isn’t just important, it’s essential.

As more demanding systems such as self-driving or collision avoidance technologies are added to cars, heat management will become even more critical. Not only will these new systems demand more power from batteries but their sensitive electronics and lasers, the lynchpin of self-driving technology LIDAR, will degrade as they overheat.

“Innovation isn’t always about doing the impossible,” said **Dr.Timothy Knowles**, **CTO** of KULR Technology and a veteran of space thermal management technology. “Many times, the most significant innovations and advances come from solving the most obvious and most common problems. For many technologies, and especially for EVs, heat and power efficiency are constant and serious problems and our technology provides the most serious answer.”

But it turns out using carbon fiber to efficiently cool batteries and high-technology EV components can have even more important benefits when done correctly. In testing with NASA for crewed space flight, KULR’s carbon fiber can be configured to stop dangerous battery fires and explosions.

The safety assembly, known as the KULR Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS), has been proven to contain the potentially catastrophic impacts of thermal runaway where the failure of a single lithium-ion battery cell can trigger a neighboring one and so on in a chain reaction explosion.

It’s not necessary to be an EV scientist to know that limiting or preventing battery fires is a major concern for EV makers – and drivers. Eventually, fire safety systems like KULR’s TRS may be standard in all EVs – not just cars but boats, trains, construction equipment, space and aerospace vehicles and drones. Really, anything with a battery that moves.

If anything is more sensitive than cars in balancing the needs of space and weight with battery power, it’s drones. Drones have to be lighter, deploy more power, go faster, and being airborne, have even less risk for failure.

That’s why, to test and prove their space-designed carbon cooling fiber, KULR has partnered with drone designers, engineers and racers at DR1 – the fastest, most technologically demanding drone racing circuit. Starting this year, KULR will be the DR1 Technology Partner. And what KULR proves in the air will find its way to the road.

“It’s a kind of natural evolution,” CTO, Dr.Timothy Knowles, said. “Our carbon fiber was designed for space and has been used in more than 100 applications for places like Mars and the international space station. Now, we’re making drones lighter, faster and safer and we’re already testing our products for more earth-bound vehicles such as cars and trucks – working our way down so to speak.”

If KULR can crack the EV heat problem — adding to battery efficiency all while making those batteries safer, it would be difficult to over-state the potential contribution to EVs. Consumers are unlikely to turn in the keys to their gas-powered cars and pick up ones for EVs until those alternatives go as far, as fast, as reliably as easily. Doing that will require batteries that are safer and more efficient and KULR may just hold the keys to that.

First Social Network That Allows Users to Mine Cryptocurrency  


Getting Paid For Data and Social Activity

Just $5 &amp; 5 Minutes to Setup

SPRINGFIELD, OH, Sept. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- EF Hutton Inc., a subsidiary of HUTN, Inc. (OTC:[HUTN](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/hutn)) today announced it is launching MeggaCoin, a private utility coin, on Monday October 1st which can be mined by users of the MeggaLife family of social Apps who are rewarded those users for their data and their online social activity.  Users can ""Bank their Coin"" in an EF Hutton account.   Users that accumulate 20 million MeggaCoin can redeem MeggaCoin for cash held by MeggaTrust, an independent trust that is overseen by independent third-party trustees.  MeggaTrust assets back the MeggaCoin.  MeggaTrust receives 100% of the advertising revenue generated by MeggaLife Apps, net only of the cost to operate the social Apps and a nominal redemption fee.  On the day coins are redeemed users get their proportionate share of the MeggaTrust assets. With MeggaCoin users receive the full value of their data and online social activity. 

New to Digital Assets and Don't Have A Digital Wallet? No Problem

MeggaLife makes it easy for beginners to start mining Coin.  It's safe, low-cost and setup is fast.  First, there is no need for users to have a digital wallet.  EF Hutton allows users to Bank their MeggaCoin in an EF Hutton account that is designed to allow users to accumulate value in a tax-deferred account.  Details are available at meggalife.com.  And Setup is easy -- it only takes five minutes to open an EF Hutton account.  This saves users the hassle of setting up a digital wallet to hold MeggaCoin.  And EF Hutton's digital account relieves concerns over security issues that vex many digital wallets because MeggaCoin is held in a secure custody account monitored by EF Hutton rather than a personal wallet.  Moreover EF Hutton is a regulated financial firm while most digital wallet providers are unregulated.  Another advantage is the cost.  Digital Wallets that hold coins and tokens apply transaction fees that can add up.  But an EF Hutton account requires only a one-time fee as low as $5.00.   There are four MeggaCoin mining plans to choose from with the trade-off being the upfront setup fee versus the redemption fee.

Making Serious Coin

User data is valuable.  We're talking serious coin.  Most people do not realize how valuable their data is and the giant social networks avoid revealing the true value because user ignorance benefits them.  In fact, the lifetime value of your data and social activity can be as much $100,000, in some cases even more.  Users of other social networks have no opportunity to mine coin and gain value for their data.  [MeggaLife.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZLs1kp4F3ewIwnvA5PbQPFgbDtQXHyfGA0rPwdp2egU25LMyOBcmvU0iSlxoeHcx94SVmHdpGpDjf5BTg35YRw==)'s social Apps were built to enable users to gain the full value of their data and online social activity.  Suzie Orman tells people they need to save more money.  True - but saving is hard for many people.  Mining for MeggaCoin is an easy way to accumulate an asset to supplement savings. 

MeggaCoin is Backed by a Trust

All the advertising revenue received by Megga Inc.'s MeggaLife.com social Apps goes into an independent Trust that is governed by an independent third-party trustees and the ad revenue held by the trust backs MeggaCoin.  The more users, the more advertisers and therefore the more ad revenue that goes into the trust. The trustees include the former head of the social security administration under President Obama.  The Trust is advised by EF Hutton for a fee of less than one percent per year.  All trust assets are held by a registered custodian who currently holds over $50 billion of other custody assets.

Wide Range of Social Apps - Why ""Double G""

[MeggaLife.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZLs1kp4F3ewIwnvA5PbQPHQsYq0CYDdFjlfu9R92N3xiiz7MFOlk1mwSi62ggfD36AQYWzXLs8O6XZiD3YzYcQ==) has a range of social Apps to match user preferences and they're available for download now on the Android and Apple App Stores.  Followers can catch your Buzz at [MeggaBuzz.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5YrK9MNXdPuZvVoFSMzb5wWz5ZrGuypEfq9rZtszYm8VbPI-MNT-I2PZ3gauNpFwCt_RApUPHfK_VtRgjWl57A==), a short message platform can use Each Buzz can be up to 140 characters.  Those that like a more general social network can use [Meggamigo.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qokKN1ulm0XRt9CY3g68HfdsgkDuJe_tu8HrZlA9Z2Vuy8ieIdAOJ6SMVQUW8900yPcD9Q6LKoLCodY09wB0jQ==).

User Data Policy

MeggaLife.com does not sell your personally identifiable data.  The privacy policy prohibits sale to advertisers as well as to prospective partners.  Other large social media companies have transferred user data to partners.  We don't want to name names but certain executives of those firms has to do a bit of facetime in front of congress to explain the breaches.

""MeggaCoin has the potential to transform lives,"" said EF Hutton CEO Chris Daniels. He continued ""Everyone now has a choice.  Either: give your data to the giant social media companies for free or use MeggaLife to mine MeggaCoin and Bank the full value of your social data and online social activity.""

Let's Grow This Together - Users, Miners, Partners, Investors, Developers Welcome

Those who like the MeggaLife concept are encouraged to signup today. Tell friends and tell them to ""friend"" or ""follow"" you when they sign up.  Because the first five people that a new user ""friends"" or ""follows"" on their first day each get 20 MeggaCoin.

Those who love it and want to be involved in global disruptive change that helps average people gain the benefits of their data and social internet use - should contact us.  We are actively looking for partners, advertisers, developers, investors and energized employees.  

It's important to note that MeggaLife.com was built with the team's personal capital.  No funding from venture capital sources who might have forced us to compromise our vision of a new model for the social internet - one that gives users the value they deserve.  HUTN Inc. is the parent company of both EF Hutton and Megga Inc. and the parent company shares are publicly available under the symbol HUTN.

MeggaCoin Impact

MeggaCoin is a virtual currency, specifically a private utility token.  It expands the market for cryptocurrency by enabling almost any person to mine for coin, building a valuable asset.  And it is designed to be easy so that MeggaMiners have everything within one simple ecosystem. MeggaCoin enables average people to accumulate an asset from things they already do.  Almost everyone uses a social network.

Power of Social Capital

MeggaCoin is a catalyst for social capital and Martin Luther King 3d has [posted](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yKgRgBJ8iYt_LY4hkpbXJ512SEYB55_XRZjqS4N3IRon7Z8q9RV_PrczEHh8A_ZyXtAZtE_D3vUIkX1kebNaJA0DLq2UXJzn0ohTn0zSybXK4YVgKSVaHz1qVTo9PfyD9yX5VV7q6Sc6SclekZDIdINM4-hc2fpMcgSnNUCiYcf1FIHkAF5fr1Vx8aAAng65Tu6VzSjSNN967GIqr0b3YaDCakNdi2HMeFy-5R8fijY=) on social media about it.  It generates value by bringing together millions of people who can benefit because they are collectively interesting to advertisers.  In fact, Meggalife users will click more on ads because they know the advertiser's payments go into the MeggaTrust.  In turn, advertisers gravitate to MeggaLife because they ""feel the love"" from grateful users.
