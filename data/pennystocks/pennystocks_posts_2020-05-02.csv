10,APPS(Digital Turbine): DD on a company with a high potential,gcat7h,PradoMV96,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcat7h/appsdigital_turbine_dd_on_a_company_with_a_high/,1,2,"**APPS, also known as Digital Turbine**, is a company that works at the convergence of media and mobile communications, delivering end-to-end products and solutions for mobile operators, device OEMs and other third parties to enable them to effectively monetize mobile content. 

Essentially what Digital Turbine does is [this](https://www.digitalturbine.com/about/):  They makes it easier than ever for people to frictionlessly discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.

The past three quarters have [proved to show consistently strong numbers](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/financials), quarter after quarter and year after year. This past earnings call for their most recent quarter was posted back in February on the 10th. Their third quarter revenue was $36 Million which is the company's **all time** high revenue and it shows an **18% growth** when compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2019. 

Even better, they reported a $12.5 Million **growth** in their cash balance and they reported **ZERO DEBT.**  [Here is the DD on what i have said in terms to their growth and zero debt report.](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results)

Not only did Digital Turbine post incredibly positive earnings, reporting their all time high revenue, they also confirmed an acquisition. APPS purchased ""Mobile Posse"" for a reported $66 Million. This is incredibly well done business for multiple reasons.

*  They achieved 2019 revenue of $59.1 million, a GAAP Net Income of $4.5 million and a Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million 
* They have reported rapid revenue and profitability growth over the past 5+ years 
* They  have a highly profitable, recurring business model with gross margins approaching 50% and EBITDA margins in excess of 20% 
* The acquisition of Mobile Posse brings Digital Turbine **strategic partners which are Tmobile and Metro PCS**

The best part of everything i have just mentioned is that it will be reflected during their next earnings call which is on [June 1st](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/earnings). Here is all the [DD on everything i had just mentioned regarding APPS acquisition of Mobile Posse.](https://content.equisolve.net/_dd96bc3559702235d3af3b6271f3a98c/digitalturbine/db/199/1884/pdf/Mobile+Posse+Investor+Summary+FINAL.pdf)

Another thing that has flown under the radar that they have recently done is this: [On February 10th](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results), Digital Turbine announced their new Global distribution with LG Electronics. This is huge deal for APPS, it'll definitely be reflected upon their next earnings call and all i can see from this distribution partnership is an increase in revenue. The distribution partnership plus the acquisition of Mobile Posse, all this will do is increase their revenue by a ton. It's amazing news, but yet both of these have gone under the radar.

**Target Prices &amp; forecasts:**

* After everything i have just mentioned, canaccord genuity  analyst Andrew Moldow increased Digital Turbine's [target price](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-digital-turbine-stock-jumped-wednesday-2020-03-04) from $8 to $12 dollars.
* Finviz currently sets APPS [target price](https://www2.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APPS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d) to $10
* CNN money currently has [6 analysts offering a price forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=APPS) for Digital Turbine Inc at a median price target of $10.00, with a high estimate of $12.00 and a low estimate of $7

**My final thoughts and comments on this stock/company:**

* I personally have invested $1000 into APPS, i bought 262 shares a month ago on April 2nd when i first began hearing about this company.
* I have also bought several long calls a month ago that have already been raking in profits for me as well. 
* I genuinely do believe that they will reach $10-15 by the end of the year. I believe so because of all their recent acquisitions and partnerships they have made, plus they have zero debt and they reported their highest ever revenue the previous quarter.
* They are so close to $7 dollars, which is CNNs lowest estimate price target, which again adds to why i believe they will reach past the $10 mark

At the end of the day, this is just thorough research on APPS. What you decide to do, whether purchase or not. Or if you do decide to purchase and you buy a little or a lot, thats all on you. Like I tell everyone, Please do your own DD as well before you ever hit submit when purchase a stock or an option.

Please read the articles and links i have clipped into this DD so you can have all the knowledge possible to make a well informed decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this DD helps you out and i hope you liked it :) Have a great weekend guys!! :)

13,"Other Incredible Microvision (MVIS) Products - Interactive Display, Lidar, Embedded Smartphone projector",gc9n9d,view-from-afar,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gc9n9d/other_incredible_microvision_mvis_products/,5,38,"First is MVIS' interactive display.  Here it is [being demonstrated at CES 2020 where it won an award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcVeSz4c7io).

It is a MEMS laser scanning projector with lidar (3D sensing) built in.  Both the projector and lidar use the same MEMS mirror.  To project the image, a MEMS mirror scans an always in focus beam of light generated by just 3 laser diodes (RGB).  The beam of light is rastered back and forth at incredible speed over a field of view.

To make the image interactive using lidar, a 4th laser diode (invisible IR) is added to the RGB beam along with a single photodetector.  All 4 scanned are by the MEMS mirror into the desired field of view.

This product was expected to be launched in 2020 by a Tier 1 OEM, believed to be Amazon.  On February 25, 2020, MVIS announced that the OEM decided not to launch in 2020 for unstated reasons.  Considering the Covid-19 lockdowns that followed immediately, it seems likely that the delay/cancellation was related.  Regardless, the company was forced to cut staff and explore other strategic alternatives and sources of cash for 2020.  The share price crashed immediately to all-time lows.

The video above includes discussions of other current and near term applications of MVIS MEMS scanning technology, including consumer lidar and automotive lidar.  These are described elsewhere as best in class in terms of range, resolution, lack of motion blur, ability to zoom in and out, etc.

They do not talk about AR or Hololens 2, likely due to NDA restrictions.

The video does not mention another MVIS product, an even tinier 720p laser projector based on the same technology that can be embedded into a smartphone.  It was launched in a 3rd tier Chinese smartphone in 2017, the [Voga V](https://www.google.ca/search?q=voga+v&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03PbQ7Ve5y4wsGKwJWy5aUfm_P2VQ:1588437576405&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi42vSLz5XpAhXHbc0KHSsrCFkQ_AUoA3oECAwQBQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=554).  The [projector received excellent reviews](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/voga-v) but the phone was substandard and failed.   Here it is [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aknykPZykeQ)

Look at the size of the image at time 2:30 and on.  For reasons beyond my grasp, the major phone OEMS have not yet incorporated the technology though their patents often refer to it.

MVIS reported in 2018 that its new MEMS scanner and ASICs provide resolution up to 1440p at 120Hz.  It is believed that this scanner is driving the Hololens 2 display. 

Note, all scan lines in videos are not visible in person.  They are a result of the refresh rates of the camera and projector not being synchronized.

My opinion:  this company is a diamond in the rough with a depressed share price due to current circumstances (including facing a reverse split due to being below the Nasdaq minimum $1 bid price) and a very long (25 year) history of slow but steady technology development at the incredible cost of $600M-$1B which has worn down generations of now exhausted shareholders.  It is facing short term cash needs and market disruptions aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic. 

FULL DISCLOSURE:  I am one of those long term shareholders, so I am obviously interested in the share price rising.  Therefore, read this with that in mind.",2020-05-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gc9n9d/other_incredible_microvision_mvis_products/

27,ALPP Going to run on Revenue report,gcdtct,arch1inc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gcdtct/alpp_going_to_run_on_revenue_report/,1,97,"Hello all,

Here to issue more DD on ALPP.

10-k Filing (year end results for 2019) is due by MAY 15. That is in 2 weeks. This report should include revenue numbers for ALPP of 29 million, an increase of 105% from previous years revenue of 14 million. Currently the stock is trading around 7 cents, way undervalued! O/S has remained unchanged (no dilution) for the past 4 months now, and this is because in November they refinanced their toxic debt into a fixed price convertible debt (FPCD) which this 10-k should reflect a large amount paid off (The 10-k will show payments up to Dec 31st 2019) and the 10Q due end of may will show payments up to April 1st I believe.  The [10-Q](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14054589&amp;RcvdDate=4/3/2020&amp;CoName=ALPINE%204%20TECHNOLOGIES%20LTD.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html) preliminary guidance is 8.5 million in revenue for quarter 1. This is larger than the current trading market cap.

[Debt settlment 8-k](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13760438&amp;RcvdDate=11/25/2019&amp;CoName=ALPINE%204%20TECHNOLOGIES%20LTD.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html) , the CEO turned a potenital hundred million+ share dilution into a max 10 million, of which NONE HAS BEEN CONVERTED. CEO states the debt is paid off weekly, and the next two filings (10-k and 10Q first quarter) will reflect this. 

The Last Quarter showed ALPP Next income positive (+2.8 million) a full 5.6 million above last years Q3. I expect their next quarter to be even more positive in the green.  Here is Q3 2019 filing for [reference](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=13750773&amp;RcvdDate=11/19/2019&amp;CoName=ALPINE%204%20TECHNOLOGIES%20LTD.&amp;FormType=10-Q&amp;View=html)

Along with improving the balance sheet, decreasing debt, increasing revenue etc. The share structure for ALPP is amazing. Small 125 million A/S with 110 million O/S, in the past the stock has squeezed and ran for days, the last being in November up to 44 cents.

2020 Should be a fantastic year for ALPP, recently an 8-k was released posting guidance due to [covid-19](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14115621&amp;RcvdDate=5/1/2020&amp;CoName=ALPINE%204%20TECHNOLOGIES%20LTD.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html). They expect 39 million in revenue, versus the regular 49 million expected, a 21% decrease from original guidance. This is very positive news as a lot other companies are taking a lot bigger hits. ALPP historically is a very transparent company, so 8-k's like this are always welcome. It is also worth mentioning the acquisition potential for 2020 as ALPP always has some companies in the pipeline for acquisition.

Other recent news involves the cancellation of the proposed r /s up to the NYSE, instead we will be growing the share price organically up to there. ALPP is incredibly undervalued right now and deserve a correction up to a fair market cap of 29 million. American company doing great things, lets hope for a great 2020.

Essentially what Digital Turbine does is [this](https://www.digitalturbine.com/about/):  They makes it easier than ever for people to frictionlessly discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.

The past three quarters have [proved to show consistently strong numbers](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/financials), quarter after quarter and year after year. This past earnings call for their most recent quarter was posted back in February on the 10th. Their third quarter revenue was $36 Million which is the company's **all time** high revenue and it shows an **18% growth** when compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2019. 

Even better, they reported a $12.5 Million **growth** in their cash balance and they reported **ZERO DEBT.**  [Here is the DD on what i have said in terms to their growth and zero debt report.](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results)

Not only did Digital Turbine post incredibly positive earnings, reporting their all time high revenue, they also confirmed an acquisition. APPS purchased ""Mobile Posse"" for a reported $66 Million. This is incredibly well done business for multiple reasons.

*  They achieved 2019 revenue of $59.1 million, a GAAP Net Income of $4.5 million and a Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million 
* They have reported rapid revenue and profitability growth over the past 5+ years 
* They  have a highly profitable, recurring business model with gross margins approaching 50% and EBITDA margins in excess of 20% 
* The acquisition of Mobile Posse brings Digital Turbine **strategic partners which are Tmobile and Metro PCS**

The best part of everything i have just mentioned is that it will be reflected during their next earnings call which is on [June 1st](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/earnings). Here is all the [DD on everything i had just mentioned regarding APPS acquisition of Mobile Posse.](https://content.equisolve.net/_dd96bc3559702235d3af3b6271f3a98c/digitalturbine/db/199/1884/pdf/Mobile+Posse+Investor+Summary+FINAL.pdf)

Another thing that has flown under the radar that they have recently done is this: [On February 10th](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results), Digital Turbine announced their new Global distribution with LG Electronics. This is huge deal for APPS, it'll definitely be reflected upon their next earnings call and all i can see from this distribution partnership is an increase in revenue. The distribution partnership plus the acquisition of Mobile Posse, all this will do is increase their revenue by a ton. It's amazing news, but yet both of these have gone under the radar.

**Target Prices &amp; forecasts:**

* After everything i have just mentioned, canaccord genuity  analyst Andrew Moldow increased Digital Turbine's [target price](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-digital-turbine-stock-jumped-wednesday-2020-03-04) from $8 to $12 dollars.
* Finviz currently sets APPS [target price](https://www2.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APPS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d) to $10
* CNN money currently has [6 analysts offering a price forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=APPS) for Digital Turbine Inc at a median price target of $10.00, with a high estimate of $12.00 and a low estimate of $7

**My final thoughts and comments on this stock/company:**

* I personally have invested $1000 into APPS, i bought 262 shares a month ago on April 2nd when i first began hearing about this company.
* I have also bought several long calls a month ago that have already been raking in profits for me as well. 
* I genuinely do believe that they will reach $10-15 by the end of the year. I believe so because of all their recent acquisitions and partnerships they have made, plus they have zero debt and they reported their highest ever revenue the previous quarter.
* They are so close to $7 dollars, which is CNNs lowest estimate price target, which again adds to why i believe they will reach past the $10 mark

At the end of the day, this is just thorough research on APPS. What you decide to do, whether purchase or not. Or if you do decide to purchase and you buy a little or a lot, thats all on you. Like I tell everyone, Please do your own DD as well before you ever hit submit when purchase a stock or an option.

Please read the articles and links i have clipped into this DD so you can have all the knowledge possible to make a well informed decision.

 Take to Social Media and post responses to Governors and reporters issuing updates regarding #Coronovirus and #COVID-19 testing letting them, and everyone else engaged on their post, know that there's an at home, $10 finger-prick test capable of delivering results in 15 seconds, and instead of being made widely available, it's collecting dust on someone's desk collecting dust due to the incompetence of the FDA.

My theory is, when the public at large hears of this, the Governors will have no choice but to start leaning on POTUS to help get this product pushed through ASAP, especially when the public understands that this is how you issue your nasal swab test: [https://imgur.com/w6UfbAe](https://imgur.com/w6UfbAe)

Hey guys, it's Flynn. Today I wanted to talk about Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (DFFN). DFFN is currently trading to 0.5120 cents per share and has a market cap of 17.717 million dollars. DFFN is a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops treatments for life threatening medical conditions and is based in Charlottesville, Virginia. On April 1st DFFN announced that they have agreed to team up with UVA Health and iTHRIV to team up against ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) which is a symptom associated with the COVID-19 virus. After the announcement of the forming of a coalition share prices skyrocketed from $.30 per share to 0.75 cents per share then made its way back down to .40 cents per share. Later in the month DFFN announced their pre-IND submission After the news of this broke share prices rose from .45 cents per share to 0.85 cents per share. I believe if the FDA grants permission to DFFN I believe history will repeat itself and follow the same result. One thing I would like to point out is that they are at risk of being delisted because they are currently being traded at under a dollar per share. A reverse split is also a potential possibility trying to raise share prices to avoid being delisted and they have till August 24, 2020 to regain compliance. I believe this stock could have some good opportunities to make money but remember bulls make money, bears make money and pigs get slaughtered. So in my opinion I think make out with profit while you can and ride the waves.",2020-05-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gc8cc5/dffn_research/

63,Trading Penny Stocks vs. Blue Chip Stocks,gc843s,mtmtrader,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gc843s/trading_penny_stocks_vs_blue_chip_stocks/,1,10,"Penny stocks get a bad reputation in the stock market, rightfully so, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad to trade. Most people actually start of trading penny stocks as opposed to what are known as *""blue chip stocks.""* Like anything else, there are pros and cons to each. I wanted to share this post to talk about some of the misconceptions of penny stocks, and explain why I personally focus on them with my own day trading.

First, **what even is a penny stock?** No... penny stocks are not just stocks worth a single penny and no they're not just stocks worth less than $1.00. By definition, any stock priced below $5.00 per share is considered a penny stock.

Penny stocks are priced low for a reason. They're *usually* the stock of a lesser-know company with not-so-reliable reputation to their shareholders. That's why they have such a bad reputation in general, and is why a lot of people think trading penny stocks is pure gambling. At the end of the day, penny stocks offer day traders a lot more than most blue chip stocks offer.

A **blue chip stock** is the stock of a huge company with a great reputation. These are stocks like Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG), Facebook ($FB), etc... basically ""household name"" companies. Although these seem like the better investment options, they're not necessarily going to be the better option for an average trader.

**Penny Stock Pros:**

**Higher Volatility:** Penny stocks generally have much higher volatility than blue chip stocks, making them more high risk, high reward. A certain amount of volatility is needed for day trading! Without it there is not enough price movement to be able to get in and out of positions within the day like day traders do. The high volatility in the penny stock market is the reason traders are able to make 10%, 20%, even 50% or more in a single day... a *very* rare occurrence in the blue chip market.

**Less Money Needed:** With penny stocks you may be able to buy 1,000s of shares at a time with a small account when you'd only be able to buy a few shares of a blue chip stock. With that being said, penny stocks are usually looked at as the much better option for new traders with limited capital to start trading. In fact, that why most new traders do end up starting with penny stocks, which leads me to the third ""pro.""

**Less ""Competition"":** Your competition in the stock market is every single other buyer and seller. Everyone is competing against each other to get the best prices and to buy low and sell high for a profit. When one person loses money, another gains! *So..*. would you rather be competing against multi-billion dollar funds and investment firms in the blue chip market, or a herd on new traders with little-to-no experience in the penny stock market? Now that's not to say there aren't still investment firms and algorithmic trading taking place in the penny stock market, but it is less common than it is in the blue chip market.

**Penny Stock Cons:**

**Higher Volatility:** A double-edged sword. As I already mentioned above, the higher volatility of the penny stock market can definitely be a big benefit, but if you're not careful it can also cause larger losses than you would experience with less volatility. This is why risk management and proper position sizing is crucial, especially when trading stocks with high volatility.

**Less Volume:** This is one of the concerns that most traders bring up when they talk about why they don't trade penny stocks. In my opinion, this doesn't make much sense as a ""con"" just for penny stocks, because there are plenty blue chip stocks with low liquidity and volume as well. As day traders, we have to adapt to the market on a daily basis. This means finding the stocks making larger-than-average moves with high relative volume and, usually, news or a press release to go along. Volume is only an issue with day trading penny stocks if you're choosing the wrong penny stocks to day trade.

**Low-Quality Companies:** Again, penny stocks are priced low for a reason. If they were multi-billion dollar companies with years of growing profitability, their stock price would reflect that. It's important to trade the stock, don't fall in love with it! You don't want to invest in a penny stock long-term, because the odds of you picking the next Amazon of Apple are slim to none. Instead, take advantage of the increase volatility brought by the penny stock market for day trading and look to the more reliable blue chip market for your swing trades longer-term investments.

As you can see, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider before diving into the penny stock market to start day trading. If you have the discipline to manage risk properly then they can be a great option to grow a small trading account in a short period of time. *Otherwise,* you may want to take things a bit more slowly by focussing your trading on less volatile, more stable blue chip stocks.
