Just a quick update. Please know that this is not financial advice and should only be used for entertainment value. I wanted to wait for the first one hour candle to complete. So basically it’s just consolidating in this area still, I’m thinking about holding over the weekend and selling after it breaks out, whenever that may be. Not a lot of movement on today’s prices, but I feel comfortable holding TTI. If you’re struggling emotionally with these trades, that’s totally normal. I’m going to do a stream on risk management next, and we’ll go over how to properly risk money in these trades.

Just a quick update. Please know that this is not financial advice and should only be used for entertainment value. So on the daily chart for VISL you can see that it’s almost at the point of using 100 day EMA as support (black line coming in from the left) and previously used that same line as resistance. today will probably end up negative, but if we look at this from a ‘bullish trend is just starting’ mindset, this is a great sign where VISL is at currently. If today closes BELOW that 100day EMA, bad sign. If it closes right on it, then Monday daily candle is bullish reversal candle, good sign.  Cheers!",2020-05-01

Was at 70+c until a seeking alpha hit them down to low 60c. Then they lost the contract talks with another teir 1 company and hit 17c.  

Mvis has a reddit with a pinned timeline showing how msft is buying their product to run their hololens2. 

The vote for reverse split happened 2 months ago, the results will be announced may 19th at the annual shareholder online conference (virtual).

The week of the conference it is likely when any big names or companys who bought 5%/10% in the spike last month will have to file the documents. This is merger hype.

The filing today is the new CEO saying they need to reverse split to be a better slice of meat for a buyout, but if they hit $1 for 10 days it accomplishes the same thing.  Also. He is begging for yes votes which could lead people to believe the no votes have it currently.


Edit:

The new ceo stated last call that he would seek to sell the patents, create licensing agreements, or sell the company. It's not just bs pump misinformation the new CEO is trying to increase the value.

I feel obligated to caution that it's not that simple and it doesn't work like that every time. There could just as easily be some bad news today that completely tanks it, or the run-up may just never get off the ground next week.

As long as you are holding the stock, unless it hits zero, you haven't really lost anything. Hold until you break even or make a modest gain and get out of the position. This is the exact reason you don't yolo your entire portfolio into one position.

Bought 1000 TTI, AMPY, and VISL yesterday after market and now i'm down 11%, 13%, and 14% respectively. This morning I took 25% of my portfolio and bought 10 SPY 285p 5/4 for $2500 when spy was at $285.90 and sold it 5 minutes later when SPY dropped to $284 for a $700 gain which made up for my daily losses. Had I went all in on my penny positions, I would be stuck bag holding. Instead, I'm back to where I was at open, and now I own stocks that I can afford to hold until they go up in value.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, I know this is a penny stock sub, but I've been making that spy play 3 times a week for about a month now. Usually buy and sell within first 30 minutes of market open. The only close call I've had was last Tues. when I bought an open dip at 290 strike 4/29 exp. and it dropped all day to 285.85. I was pulling my hair out and decided to hold overnight.

250,BKNY75,fp7hj9i,/r/pennystocks/comments/gbrapw/would_you_guys_agree_stock_pumping_is_like_a/fp7hj9i/,5,"It’s human nature. Just like mass hoarding of toilet paper for the Rona. How many people saw others buying mass quantities of TP on television and thought “all those people are buying that shit, I better race to the store and buy some too”. 

Or how many people toss things in their shopping cart based solely on observing people with the same items in theirs? 

Pumping and dumping works the same way. There’s buzz about a company, and people race out to buy in. Shit. Even old folk that had no idea what crypto is bought bitcoin when it pushed towards $20k in 2017. Now there’s societal FOMO. So many people watched others get rich after the crash in 2008 that they’re all scared they’ll miss buying in at the bottom of anything so they’re slinging money all over the market. 

And once it dumps, those same people panic and get out. 

This is why you have to have a planned entry and exit and stick to it. As long as you do, you can beat the pump and dump. This will keep you from holding on too long, or getting out too late. Make a plan for your desired profit and stick to it. Don’t get wrapped up in “I could have made so much more!” 

UAVS kept a lot people in too long and they got stuck with bags because they had no plan to exit, or they didn’t stick to it out of greed.",2020-05-01

UAVS had more hype surround it than MVIS does currently, however that’s subject to change come next week. 

At the end of the day expect modest upticks till earnings on the 7th. Could uptick slow to .80 or could rocket to $2. 

Monday will bring a clearer picture

Edit:

Further to that, what’s giving me a lot of confidence is how the stock performed today. There was a lot of red today. A LOT. And yet MVIS made a 26% gain during hours and is currently up another 12% after hours.

You also have to remember that the market is basically all people (and algos coded by people) and people are unfortunately victims of their own mentality.

The majority will be either incremental improvements on existing tech, or a simple technique that has been obfuscated to the point that it looks unique. Getting a patent is laughably easy with the right attorneys - successfully mitigating a patent is not. Check out Schlumberger's Mozley sand removal system - look familiar? 

2 - Big contracts are often awarded based on companies being able to prove certain technologies or tools, or performing satisfactorily in a few pilot wells. They can and do fall through regularly, especially in the middle east. If this is a Saudi Aramco then it isn't worth the paper it's written on.

To the point where I am honestly shocked the FDA gave approval of any kind.

HOWEVER, keep a few things in mind with regards to the approval:

1. It's only approved for COVID use (not its actual purpose).
2. Its only emergency approved which means very limited usage.
3. It's only likely to be used in cases where there is no hope as its extremely risky which limits its usage even further (patient has to be fully expected to die).
4. They are giving it away for FREE right now so no profit.

Volume and price don’t mean anything alone. They are just indicators that you use to bring light to certain situations. 

Huge increasing volume on the daily chart means buyers are coming in when a stock has been stagnant for a while. However huge volume after a stock has made a run means sellers are trying to take a profit. 

On the intraday chart a large volume spike could be igniting a run up. However at the top of a run a huge volume spike (even if it’s a green candle) usually means the run is coming to an end.

Just a quick update. Please know that this is not financial advice and should only be used for entertainment value. On the daily chart for MVIS, you can see that it’s trying to use 100 day Ema as support (black line coming in from the left) If today closes at $0.4192, great sign! (Which is kinda what I’m expecting) it already came down and touched my buyin retracement level (blue box) and the current one hour candle is looking to close as a bullish reversal candle. If it closes below $0.4192 on the daily, I would expect to see another daily close lower next week in the $0.3746 range before moving higher. Cheers!",2020-05-01

955,1st_Amendment_EndRun,fp668ku,/r/pennystocks/comments/gbjt2r/mvis_megathread/fp668ku/,1,"So... back in the day (like over a decade ago), I had this crazy idea that direct laser projection onto the retina was the only real way to achieve seamless AR (augmented reality).  MVIS immediately came up on my radar due to the fact that they had a working, miniaturized three color laser projectors that were always in focus.  I actually purchased one for the direct purpose of (self)testing.  What I found was that the semiconductor lasers in production today aren't really suitable for projecting on to a tightly grouped (\~20mm\^2) compound of retinal cells (the fovial area of the macula) that are constantly moving around.  Further, being able to track saccadic movement of the macula through the pupil/lens is almost impossible to accomplish from a fixed exterior location that manages to remain out of the line of sight.  The only real workable hack is to saturate the entire retina with laser projection and then move a high resolution section of the projection around with the macula... unfortunately, this equipment doesn't exist outside of science fiction.

&amp;#x200B;

So... unless MVIS has worked some substantial magic, it is unlikely that any of their technical offerings are useful for the augmented reality that Microsoft is most likely interested in.

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly, there's not letter of delisting warning out there for MVIS's listing on Nasdaq Global Market.

&amp;#x200B;

The desire to stay listed is real.  Once they get thrown to the dogs in the OTCMKTS, they become unacquireable.  All you have to do is look at Apple's treatment of LQMT to understand this.  Apple could have easily afforded to purchase the entire company, but because they were listed on the OTCMKTS, that deal could not be brokered fairly due to the generally corrupt nature of the OTCMKT market makers.

&amp;#x200B;

This might be the last gasp for MVIS:  reverse split and work on being acquired or off to the OTCMKTS glue factory they go.  If the reverse split happens, they get an 18 month (maximum) reprieve from that death sentence.",2020-05-01

I am looking for opinions on whether my plan is worth pursuing with the following stocks that I currently own.

VISL:
200 Shares
0.35 Average Cost

MVIS:
100 Shares
0.40 Average Cost

TTI:
100 Shares
0.50 Average Cost

I plan on either selling 100 shares of VISL at 0.70 and continue holding or sell all 200 shares before their conference call on May 8th.

I plan on selling all 100 shares of MVIS before their conference call on May 7th.

I plan on selling all 100 shares of TTI when it reaches 0.70.

972,OHFTT127,fp6824f,/r/pennystocks/comments/gbhgrw/something_needs_to_be_said_everyone_can_learn/fp6824f/,1,"So, a ""stop order"" means once it hits your specified price, it will sell at the next available (market price.) 

Example: Stock is currently trading at $1.10 and trending downward. You set a ""stop order"" at $1.00, so once it hits that $1.00, it will sell at the next available market price... which could be $1.00, $0.99, $0.98, etc. 

A ""stop limit order"" means once it hits your specificed price, it will sell at a minimum price that you've set (limit price.) 

Example: Stock is currently trading at $1.10 and trending downward. You set a ""stop limit order"" at $1.00 with a LIMIT order of $0.99, so once it hits that $1.00, it will trigger a sell at your specificed price of $0.99. Nothing lower than that. 

A stop limit order ensures you're selling your stock for the price you want, and nothing lower. 

So in this trader's case above, he set a ""stop order"" for $4.50 but because he didn't specificy a minimum sell price, the stop loss triggered at $4.50 and actually sold for $4.23 (a $0.27 difference, which is actually huge.) If they had set a ""stop limit order"", let's say for $4.45, the stop loss would have triggered at $4.50 and actually sold for $4.45 (a $0.05 difference.)

Market Orders operate from the position of “I want to buy/sell 100 shares for whatever $/share someone is interested in accepting/paying me at this moment.”  There are no limitations.  It’s whatever happens to be the next tier of ask/bid available.
Limit Orders operate from the position of “I want to buy/sell 100 shares but only for this $/share amount.  This limit establishes the tiers of ask/bid.
If you don’t know what the ask/bid numbers represent, its very important to learn. 
UAVS was a great example to learn from.  My impression was that as soon as it hit $5.00 it triggered a huge volume of market sells that severely dropped the value of stock in a matter of seconds.  The reason the stock rebounded after was based on all the market and limit buy order that were being placed prior to and unknowingly in the midst of the sell off.  But the volume selling greatly outnumbered the volume buying, so the stock dropped anyway.  If every sell order had a limit it would have softened the collapse.  If ever shareholder had a limit sell in place it would have greatly slowed the decline. 
If you have more questions I will try to answer them.",2020-05-01

If your account is smaller then 1K you should be paper trading or using small size in a cash account until you have a proven winning strategy. 

I had 1-2K when i first started and i would take $100-$200 positions and never ran out of money. 

If you do have a winning strategy, use an offshore broker for a little bit they give you like 4-6 times leverage and no PDT. You’ll be at 50K faster than you can imagine.

When the shareprice jumps from $0.40 to $0.80 this 100% increase looks dramatic but in reality at $0.40 the company is only worth approx $15m. 

A lot of my investment successes comes from investing a tiny mcap company and holding for a breakthrough of some sort which propels the shareprice to a more realist value. 

When you say the market for a treatment is worth hundreds of $billions, surely the potential and speculation in DFFN securing a share of this is worth more than the current mcap. 

The shareprice doesn’t reflect this the way you report it. 

Your DD only really related to traders if you are talking about theoretical share prices based on catalysts. 

There is no reason DFFN couldn’t be a $100m company if the next two updates give FDA and EU approval and the trials are promising and worth $300m if trials are a resounding success. 

In my opinion, the current shareprice and $15m mcap is priced for failure. So massive upside and possibly only 30-40% downside.",2020-05-01

Aditionally there are more warrants from past offerings. Knowing this Diffusion Pharms will likely make their own offering on the next pop so as to beat additional warrants from being exersized and increase their funding. That or they will make a deal to exercise the warrant and sell them additional warrants. Be careful here. Recomend selling the next pop.

I’m usually half or all in with a relatively small account, and I set really conservative stop losses. Sometimes I screw up though, or the trade stops me out with a quick dip before it skyrockets. I’m still learning so I’m changing my strategy as I go, like splitting it up into groups so one fails I still have cash to trade that stock when it really pops. (You should practice by paper trading)

I find stock picks here on reddit, ( r/pennystocks r/daytrading and r/wallstreetbets ) and then double-triple check on news and volume with a scanner before decide to maybe try and I get in. Be vary careful around pump and dumps. We’re prime targets for it. But you can still ride the wave.

I’m in one at a time day trading, maybe two. I worry about holding penny stocks (or any stock really) for too long. I know there are really good stable stocks, but I personally have stock ADD and like the hunt and gamble. Man is it stressful though! If I wanted steady gains I’d just put it in vanguard or something similar. (Check r/investing )

So one is a low risk/medium to reward stock ( that would be NAT ) the  rest I use for aggressive plays on penny stocks. It varies from person to person. I’ve tried having several stocks going at once and I think that’s part of the reason I got burned on DECN. 
To me it makes more sense cause I can be more in tune and more refined in the DD I do on my stocks. I occasionally have a third I low/medium invest in but not often.
My two plays currently is 175 shares of NAT ( been adding more since my account has gone higher plus I added 200$ for it ) because to me there’s an almost nonexistent risk factor and a medium to high output potential on it. I dropped a ton on UAVS this morning during premarket and proceeded to sell when it hit 4.80

Overall. I think finding what works best for you is key. Find out how many stocks your comfortable with being dipped in. What are the risks. Where is the charts and projections have it going short term if your trying to make moves or longterm if your throwing the deep ball.
As for finding stocks. Honestly this subreddit is really really good for it. Twitter is another one. I honestly mainly use this sub then I do my own DD after to make a decision on the info i have.

I’m not sure about bots and such influencing trades but hedge funds, your guys with massive amounts of capital, and your sketchy crowd ( Tim Sykes and guys like that ) tend to mess with stocks often. Ride the wave when you see this stuff but don’t crash on it.",2020-05-01

1662,wastedtimepiece,fp4lqhh,/r/pennystocks/comments/gb8t6e/im_a_noob_answer_my_noob_questions/fp4lqhh/,1,"**What % of your investment portfolio should be directed towards high risk investments like penny stocks?**  I know this varies with age- I'm 32, but is there not a minimum emergency and retirement savings as well as safer stocks/indices you should have before taking on more risk in penny stocks?  Is there even a consensus?

I don’t recommend investing unless you have a solid security net like a savings account that you don’t ever touch. After that I’d recommend having a third of your stock money in risky stocks, a third in long term quality stocks and a third in some sort of low threat bonds or CDs or something of that nature. If you’re going to play with risky stocks only use what you don’t mind losing.

**Do you diversify your penny stock portfolio or gamble on one or two at a time?**  I get the sense that the more experienced folks are invested in 5 or more penny stocks at a time.  I find this intimidating and potentially inaccurate.

I typically have 5-7 penny stocks going at a time, it’s hit closer to 10 off and on, but I feel like I don’t have enough attention to give to that many and maintain the awareness I need on them. I’m sure others are a lot more successful at this than me.

**How do you find your stock picks?**  If you get your tips from other people's tips, what is their source?  How do I go about finding a winner before everyone else does?  I've been late to the party more than I'd like to admit.

I make my penny stock picks off of sites like:

https://stock-screener.org/penny-stock-losers.aspx

I look for stocks that have good size volume, are sitting around 10-14% losses for the day and closed lower than they opened. I then check those against places like yahoo, reddit, do quick searches on negative news such as bankruptcy, R/S etc to see if I think they are going to bounce within a day or two.

Most importantly I check sites like globalnewswire, the company’s webpage for news and then look at their financials in case I get caught holding

**How can you identify a pump and dump situation?**  And how do you avoid getting burned by one?  Or better yet, take advantage of it? 

This sub, comments in yahoo finance, Twitter, plus looking at the volume for the day versus the average volume. Take into account recent pricing in different increments (day, week, month, etc)


**What is the influence of algorithmic trading bots or large financial institutions in the penny stocks arena?** I am unclear on their role in the market, and if I should even care.

Huge depending on the stock. On more expensive stocks you can see a bunch dips and spikes throughout the day...they can be dangerous, but if you do your research you can know when to buy in.

I don’t make a living from this...I am just bored and it keeps me busy. I also prefer small wins over rockets, so take my method for whatever it is.


Edit: forgot to mention I always look to see what my potential profits are at different levels to figure out if it’s worth my time or not and how far do I think something might swing

Basic example and for simplicity I’m going to use small numbers: I buy 400 shares at .23 for $92...if it moves to .24 I’m sitting at $96...so $4 gain. If it swings to .28 I’m at $112 so $20 gain....this is just a super basic example, but it helps me determine my sell points and risk vs reward...when I’m doing it with much bigger money, I’m a lot more conservative with my risks. 
Using percentages instead of looking at the money value helps me figure out selling points as well.


Hope this helps, good luck and look for the small wins!",2020-05-01

 Happens often in these pump and dumps. Usually the halt lasts for 5-15minutes today it was an hour.  

 Normally  UVAs had a  an average volume of 24 mill shares a day traded. Before 11am it already had 90 million volume. Well  all those 90 million tried to sell at once causing a halt.  At close it had 185 millions shares traded

 This also happens when there is to much buying  a short amount of time.

1695,Noexit007,fp4q9td,/r/pennystocks/comments/gbaotz/question_about_stocks_halting/fp4q9td/,4,"&gt;so my question is, is it common for companies to halt stocks after PR's? 

To clarify, UAVS didn't halt their stock. It was halted by the marketplace itself (or the SEC does it). Here is a good read on halts specifically:

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp

Generally, if you see a stock skyrocketing up or down or both in a short period of time, the chances of a halt (or suspension) dramatically go up. Today's halt(s?) for UAVS was due to volatility. Namely skyrocketing up and then falling off a cliff suddenly with insanely high volume for the type of stock and size of the company.

And while not always, if a stock is on the way down and it is halted, then yes it probably will drop a lot more when the halt is lifted. Honestly, UAVS did better than I expected in terms of maintaining value. It ended the day above expectations if you throw all the Amazon stuff out the window and just look at the stock value. It just fell from a stupidly high place where it never really should have been.",2020-05-01

They also shared more about their board and the value each of them brings.

I’m long on this company. They seriously seem to be doing everything right.

MVIS immediately came up on my radar due to the fact that they had a working, miniaturized three color laser projectors that were always in focus.  I actually purchased one for the direct purpose of (self)testing.  What I found was that the semiconductor lasers in production today aren't really suitable for projecting on to a tightly grouped (~20mm^2) compound of retinal cells (the fovial area of the macula) that are constantly moving around.  Further, being able to track saccadic movement of the macula through the pupil/lens is almost impossible to accomplish from a fixed exterior location.

I also assume their fixed costs (mostly wages and G&amp;A) to increase 25% to $750,000 .

All of that will give an EPS of .025. The Misc. manufacturing sector averages 28 P/E. Halving that to 14 P/E yields a year end share price of $0.35.

These are the breweries most likely to buy high-end equipment and Brewbilt is a high-end brand in this space. I can tell you that my personal alcohol consumption has increased while staying at home, but I’m still buying the same craft beer that I was before. I’m not switching to miller lite just because the bars are closed. 

In their 10-K filing they said they had ~80000 sqft of product space and we’re planning planning on leasing an additional ~76000 sqft in the same building. They just don’t have the production space to do all the work they’re taking in. From the PRs it seems like they only have the capacity to work on 3 orders at once, they need to do more to keep up with the sales pipeline. 

They’ve also been diversifying their markets. For example, in February they took an order to build 5 cold water extraction tanks for CBD, that order is for $7M alone. I also recall some mention of them making distillery equipment too. 

Their board member is also apparently helping them to get their quality management systems in order so they can provide equipment to the pharmaceutical industry. A lot of biosimilars (insulin, some vaccines, proteins) are produced by fermentation of genetically modified yeast. These fermenters are called bioreactors, but they’re very similar to a brewing tank. If they can get the paperwork in order to be an approved supplier for FDA regulated pharma companies they can sell basically the same product for 3-5x the price.

They seem to be experimenting with additional business lines while expanding their main brewery business. They’re good at designing and building systems that move a lot of fluid around while controlling temperature and pressure. So they could theoretically make a lot of different industrial equipment if they had the network/sales to get the orders.",2020-05-01

The Trump Administration recognizes there's a problem with the FDA, and will soon replace HHS Secretary Azar. The part of the job Azar did worst was management of the FDA, an agency run as if it were a political action committee for big pharma. The new HHS Secretary will have the task of cleaning up FDA, and doing it quickly. 

Two other HUGE Developments:

A. NIH was recently given $1.5 BILLION to pay bounties for new testing technologies. Expect DECN to apply for the prize as soon as there is some sort of form to fill out. (HINT BET ON THE #GENVIROSWIFT💰) 

B. Trump, who is furious with the FDA, who blew it with the ventilators and the test kits, in typical FDA fashion where they decided to choose winners and losers but again chose wrong. So Trump set up a quiet White House group, no big announcement, no fanfare, under the management of Dr. Birx and an Admiral Griorir. This group is working hand in hand with the MDMA (Medical Device Management Association) and Birx and the Admiral have been given FULL authority to review and approve new technologies, in particular those technologies that identify the antigen Corona virus directly (GenViro! is one such product). The overall focus if the Birx group is to identify kits for business and at-home use. Sound familiar? 

Expect DECN to file for EUA for their at-home use version of GenViro! in the next few days, perhaps this weekend! 

YES!!! .5 - .6 bid!!!

""As you know, we have been working with a North American technology OEM for a 2020 launch of our interactive display module in their product line and we expected to complete a supply agreement. We were recently informed by the OEM that for various reasons, they were no longer targeting a 2020 launch of their product. These reasons were not related to our technology or capability to execute in production.

They shared with us that internal considerations factored into their decision not to launch in 2020 but did not provide details on these discussions. This, of course, was a very disappointing and big surprise to us. While we worked with them to explore all reasonable options for a 2020 launch, their internal reasons for this decision was something we could not overcome.

We believe that we remain in good standing with the OEM and its teams. As a result of this decision, the company would have faced financial challenges in 2020. Therefore, on February 25, with a heavy heart, we announced a reduction to our workforce of approximately 60% to reduce our expenses and create an appropriate runway to allow us to monetize the vertical markets we have created products for, namely, augmented reality, consumer LiDAR and interactive display.

We are currently actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives. The management team and I are committed with a sense of urgency to find a monetization path through licensing to support our go-forward strategy. We are actively engaged with our Board to evaluate and consider all options and alternatives to maximize shareholder value.

Let me also comment on our April 2017 contract customer. We are amicably working with them to provide continuity of supply that is consistent with our contract and a nonexclusive license to use our technology in their products. Again, we believe we are in good standing with them as we cooperatively move forward.

With our timely action to reduce workforce and the ability to raise additional funds using Lincoln Park facility as needed, we believe we have created runway that will allow us the opportunity to close one or more licensing agreement in the first half of 2020. We have retained critical staff needed to support technology transfer for a potential license agreement.

I'm impressed by our staff who remain engaged in our path to recovery and growth. The value of the technology we have created is evident to them and confirmed through the response of our OEM partners, we -- who include a list of the highest tier companies. I expect MicroVision to grow again through this tough time and that our dedicated employees and shareholders would also enjoy the fruits of that growth in the future.

I believe MicroVision's future lies in developing our perceptive automotive LiDAR products and entering partnerships with automotive Tier 1 suppliers. Since 2019, we have been actively engaged with presenting our technology road map to automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers and have continuously received positive feedback on our products and potential partnership structures. We are currently developing our first automotive LiDAR samples targeted for OEM demonstration in Q4 2020. I believe our perceptive LiDAR products will bring true solid-state automotive LiDAR capable of an operating range greater than 200 meters with perceptive edge computing in full sunlight first to market.""
