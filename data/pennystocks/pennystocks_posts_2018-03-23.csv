0,When to bail on ENRJ??,86i0st,Mr_Bisquits,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86i0st/when_to_bail_on_enrj/,3,4,A lot of reports have had ENRJ dropping but then making a strong recovery but after today it’s lost almost a third of its value over the last 3 days. Is now more than ever the time to buy and hold or do I bail on it and try to recoup my losses elsewhere? ,2018-03-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86i0st/when_to_bail_on_enrj/

4,$IBAT - ELON MUSK tried to buy this tech for $300 mill USD,86goop,IamMat,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86goop/ibat_elon_musk_tried_to_buy_this_tech_for_300/,52,29,"The CEO and board turned him down (LOL WUT) believing the tech is worth Billions in 2014.  Since then the CEO started a new public company taking his Lithium extraction technology with him.  Last couple of days they received a patent and opening operations quite shortly.  Article of Elon here http://fortune.com/2016/06/08/tesla-lithium-startup-simbol/

It's a tiny 27 million float, volume last few days have been picking up like crazy.  IMO do your own DD, sounds weird but it's true.  The executive team is incredible and the website is very professional.  If you equate Elons offer, that's over $10 per share.  This was one of the biggest sleeper stocks and seems the market is finally seeing it on both the CAD and US side....

Always do your own DD

EDIT:  Previous company Musk tried to buy was called Simbol Materials from CEO John Burba, who is now a founder of International Battery.  Their website is here for more info https://ibatterymetals.com   

Canadian Ticker is $IBAT and US Ticker is $RHHNF 

DOUBLE EDIT: Market finally figuring this out!  Surging.
