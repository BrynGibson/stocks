3,Have you been trading for a long time but you couldn't make it yet ?,8t1446,Mr-Houssine,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8t1446/have_you_been_trading_for_a_long_time_but_you/,0,1,"Have you been trading for a long time but you couldn't make it yet ?

Have you bought a lot of courses and tried a lot of strategies but none of them worked ?

If so keep reading and i'm not here to sell you anything

Hi my name is Houssine and i've been in the trading space for 4 years now, The first three years i was trading forex but i didn't 
succeed and then i get into trading stocks in the fourth year and i've been trading in demo account for a long time and then i become a profitable stock trader thank god.

As you can see in the screenshots my success rate is more than 60% and From January to Mai i've made 6.321 USD risking 150 USD per trade but in the last two months i've doubled the risk.

January's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmgjq

February's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmhnu

March's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmhtd

April's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmi4q

Mai's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmics

Anaway the issue is that i've been struggling to get the capital to open a real account

So i thought i'll look for one person no more who's interested in learning to trade and i'll teach him FOR FREE one on one live through SKYPE.

In exchange you will share with me 35% from the Profit at the end of each month for the next 3 months in a row and then everybody goes his way.

WARNING : We gonna make a lot of live trades in virtual account until you feel confident with the strategy and only then you trade with real money.

But there are rules to be qualified

1- You need to have a background about trading stocks at least the basics

2- You need to be fast at executing trades and familiar with hot keys

So if you're qualified send me a message at : damon.ffx@gmail.com",2018-06-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8t1446/have_you_been_trading_for_a_long_time_but_you/
