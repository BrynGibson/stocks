I used to work in the group in question here and it can take anywhere from 24 hours to never.  It all depends on the quality and volume of data provided and where the company is the in validation process when they first reach out to FDA.  The overwhelming majority of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) are from crackpot companies or individuals that start the process with FDA but end up submitting non-nonsensical testing or a journal article thinking that since this is an emergency FDA will say yes to them and they can start selling their product to the American public.  With that said, the biggest factor in the timeline for a decision on an EUA is whether or not the company has even started the testing when they first reach out to FDA.  If they are reaching out to FDA at the same time they are starting to validate their device, it will be a while.   


While I am in no way trying to minimize the missteps the Agency made in the roll-out of the EUA process this time around, FDA does care that a diagnostic test works prior to distribution as false negative results can be damaging out efforts to slow the spread.",2020-04-09

36,TendiesOnMargin,fn228ig,/r/pennystocks/comments/fy1kmm/what_do_yall_think_about_mfa_and_nymt/fn228ig/,2,"Part of the issue resides in the forbearance program having no set methodology for repayment of missed payments. As I understand it, the CARES act provides no official remedy.
Most seem to assume they will be given a Loan Modification that just tacks their missed payments onto the end of their loan, but that is by no means automatic and usually involves a stringent application process in the best of times.
 By default, if the forbearance ends in month 4, the borrower will owe their 4th payment and be considered 'delinquent' on the other 3, but with the missed payments unreported to credit. All 4 payments will be legally due in that 4th month, and anything beyond that will be at the lender's discretion.
Payment plans may be set up at the lender's discretion, but even then you will be looking at increased monthly payments for a number of people that have been out of work for an extended period of time.

Currently, I expect bank lenders to be bailed out sufficiently, but non-bank lenders have been bleeding out a lot of cash on GSE payments, combined with money lost on the short positions they have on MBS's; which are used to hedge against the higher interest rates they have to pay to investors in the event MBS prices drop. Usually this is made up for by more loans being being extended by lenders, but loan traffic is way down in this current climate of rising unemployment.

Tl;dr
Lenders are over-hedged from mortgages being at an all-time high just prior to this crisis, on top of having to make unfunded payments to investors, on top of high numbers of unsaleable loans(if first payment has yet to be received); and many have financed half of the 1% needed to purchase the loan servicing rights they currently hold, with no forbearance provided to them. This, combined with servicing value being slashed from 1% to .5% from refinanced prepayments from some borrowers, and uncertainty of repayment from others, has lead to margin calls on the aforementioned lenders.
In the end you have originators with no capacity to lend after a large decrease in the value of their servicing portfolio asset.

So idk, that's how I currently understand it🤷‍♂️

The Fed probably won't let too much go to hell though.

I just see a lot of uncertainty in the whole mortgage system that makes me uneasy.",2020-04-09
37,sliight,fn2325r,/r/pennystocks/comments/fy1kmm/what_do_yall_think_about_mfa_and_nymt/fn2325r/,1,"You have most of the info in there. Another big issue is the lower rates cause people to refinance, which means servicers who pay with about three years profit up front are losing that money. Then a major issue is that the servicer is required to make the monthly payment to the investor (minus their .3% / 12 typically) regardless of if a borrower makes payments. So as it sits, people skip payments but all those payments get made still..so the servicers are going to hemorrhage money. Due to this the servicing offer is well below the typical 1% they pay up buy up loan servicing, so that profit has gone for those who make loans...

Then you pair in all the losses on the hedges you mention and most lenders won't let you lock currently, or just stopped taking applications.

So servicers need a bailout. Fed needs to buy only enough mbs to cause the price to stabilize for about 60 days, and preferably around the 3.75% mark, which is low enough to stimulate home purchases, but high enough to stop the refi frenzy (this is coming from someone paid by refinances and purchase loans... So it costs me money If rates are higher). Then lastly Fannie Freddie, or well the government who's controlling needs to allow loans to be purchased on secondary market without first payment being made...

It really is a perfect storm... I'd they don't fix, mortgage lending may mostly stop for awhile...",2020-04-09

I usually play these just like you’re saying. I swing the anticipation and sell with no regrets.

OGEN, however, I’m probably taking through results because:

1) There has been no build up to results. It was at .97 the morning the market melted down, where I sold at .93 and bought back at .62, so I expect that to retrace and more. I’m just saying that some bio’s drop on good news because the results are priced in and they aren’t priced in here, yet.
2) Results should be good to very good. There are no real worries about side effects because it’s natural to your body and past results suggest strong efficacy.
3) With good results, licensing is sure to follow. Even if I don’t hit my targets on good results and it dips, licensing is there as a backstop.
4) Fast track and orphan drug status allows for a much better possibility for conditional approval or approval with good results considering its nature and that there is no current prevention or cure. This would be months out.

However, if it runs over $1.50 before results, I will pull my initial investment and a healthy profit and only risk the remaining shares. If it runs over $2.00 before results, I’m probably out for the same reasons as you, why risk a sure thing, no matter the upside?",2020-04-09

BACAP's Criminal Line Up Matthew Dwyer, Derrick Lefcoe, and his wife Sharon Jacobson, Barbara Jacobson   


This is the criminal organization that defrauded World Oil Group and its CEO, that cost WOGI millions of dollars in business from losing an oil refinery deal in the Bahamas because Mathew Dwyer of BCAP failed to get the promised funding to build the refinery and then stole WOGI Oil Field Marketing material to try and set up another company in the oil industry.   


The Baron Capital Criminal Enterprise began long ago with the Dwyer brothers. Richard Dwyer and Matt Dwyer both former CEO’ s of the Baron Capital Criminal Enterprise. Due Diligence has reveal after going back to Matt Dwyer’s ex-wife (Barbara Lori Bass, AKA Barbara Dwyer) from back in 1997, that two Irish brothers were trying to find a way into scamming Jewish business men. So Matt Dwyer married Barber Bass just so he could say his family is Jewish and start conning Jewish business men to invest into his company for stock certificates that Matt and his Brother Richard created out of thin air.   


You can see from the 2003 Uniform Business Report of TMI Holding Inc. (same company as BCAP-just changing Articles of Inc. and adding and deleting share structures with reverse splits along the way) that Richard Dwyer was the first to begin the conning of the Jewish businessmen and then Matt jumped on the company to cover his brother from the first law suit in NY. You can see the details on IHUB at [http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=104915981](http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=104915981)   
January 24 2003, was their first reverse split on a 10-1, wow doe this start to sound familiar. As you can see from page 3 of the of the Amendment to the Article (Dated Feb 27, 2003) Richard Dwyer was showing how the do series B convertible shares in order to keep the scamming going and milk money out of the company until he could steal the company for himself and his criminal brother Matt Dwyer. You will start to see “Patterned Fraud” that get settled of court until people catch the pattern “like now” and it calls for PRISON TIME.   


Aug 26 2003, criminal brother 1 Richard Dwyer assumes a director position on TMI Holding Inc. after doing the consulting from the begging and robbing people of moneys of the series B shares. Richard Dwyer and Matt Dwyer conned Dr. Martin Peskin to get on the BOD so they could scam his money. Dr. Martin Peskin latter sued the Dwyer Boys and get a $125k settlement (that’s guilt). As you can see from these documents Ilene Little was in on the deal from the beginning the Dwyer boys started conning her for her pubic shell later to become Baron Capital.   


September 12 2003, Richard Dwyer, now President &amp; CEO of TMI Holding Inc. changes the name to Total Identity Corp. because they were close to getting busted and need to scam more money and change the shares again.   
June 30, 2004, Matthew Dwyer, the new President &amp; CEO of Total Identify Corp needs a new piggy bank and amends the article of Inc. to add a new series of A Shares Preferred and Series B Preferred and different amount so he can go on the hunt to start stealing ore money.",2020-04-09

NOTICE FROM THE NAMES ALL JEWISH BUSINESSMEN GETTING SCREWED.   


June 1 2004, Matthew Dwyer President &amp; CEO of Total Identify Corp needs more money and issues more shares 1,500,000.00 shares and now designates these as series 1 preferred shares.   
Where is the business other that blatant scamming people for money with his bogus stock shares?   


September 7 2004, Mathew Dwyer is getting heat and has to Amend the Article of Inc. of Total Identify Corp. (now known as Baron Capital Enterprises-BCAP) again to add the old crew he scammed money from to the BOD to make them feel good and keep worming them for money.   


2005- The entire year the company was not listed with the State corporation commission and was administratively dissolved.   
April 10, 2006, Totality Identity Corp was reinstated.   


October 31, 2006, Matthew Dwyer eliminates the series preferred shared in the amount of 1,250,000 million shares and reissues as series of and give himself the power to issue 1,500,000 million shares and then creates a new series dominated corporate series AA shares now and reissues 1,000,000 million shares. He continues to issues and shares that are not convertible and stages for a 10,000 to 1 reverse split again. More criminal activity going on …….   


December 1, 2006, Mathew Dwyer issues a reverse split and reissues 30,000,00 million shares and then does a name change from Totally Identify Corp to 247MGI and screws all his shareholders again. Total scam and still now business in the pig.   


Summer 2007, was the year Matthew Dwyer and his criminal cohort and brother Richard Dwyer Spilt up and Matthew Dwyer need and new accomplice to hide the stolen money from all these fake penny stock scams.   
So, Matthew Dwyer found a struggling stripper (another Jewish girl-so he can say his family is Jewish) who was helping her mom and her father with Alzheimer’s and Matthew Dwyer made a deal with her. If she would marry him and he could use her mother a father’s name to trade stock account, then he would give her 1 million dollars to start the The Clydey Foundation, Non Profit (Document number N07000010138 FL State Corporation Commission [http://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/](http://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/)) .   


She would also need to use her maiden name, so there would be no connection by name for him to put the money he scams into the nonprofit. This gave Mathew Dwyer his perfect money laundering tool just in case he got busted for scamming people like you see from all these court cases.   
Who would suspect a Kitty Cat foundation from a sweet Jewish girl to hide the money from all the Matthew Dwyer’s penny stock scams.

Matthew Dwyer trade the stocks in the names of Sharon Jacobson, Barbara Jacobson and Harvey Jacobson - (Harvey has Alzheimers how can her trade) and you will see from this video (minutes 235 to 250- Sharon Jacobson Dwyer- claims she create and paid for everting all herself-with no help- 1 million in cash?????- I think I am going to go and become a stripper like she did when Matthew Dwyer made this deal with her and took her off the pole)

Sharon Jacobson- AKA Sharon Dwyer, Matthew new wife as of 7/24/2007 makes no reference to her new husband who just spent 1 million dollars on a new custom RV for The Clydey Foundation and spent another 500K for a to decorate a Yacht – the Caprice for the Clydey Foundation in the Seminole Hard Rock Winter Fest December 2010 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0uF05LAcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0uF05LAcQ)along with paying for TV ads for the Foundation.   


You will see the amount of shareholder money spent on this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3Ub5xLE7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3Ub5xLE7U). I would be asking where the money is, that Matthew Dwyer Scammed to pay for this. Oh, but yet Sharon said she did it all on her own, on a stripper’s salary! I need to become a stripper? or a penny stock scammer to make this money. Follow the money and you now see the criminal money laundering of stolen money from penny scammer Matthew Dwyer and his accomplices, his wife Sharon Jacobson and his mother n law Barbara Jacobson.

Buy some bigger companies to let it sit in while they are low...wait for things like Ford to drop back down to 4.30-4.75...don’t put a ton of money in penny stocks like MVIS, you could lose it all. Since you’re new, put 15 bucks in MVIS when it’s low and let it sit for the next week, sell if it jumps up or hold for a possible acquisition. 

Be careful with day trade limits, don’t sell at losses, don’t buy anything that has had a huge increase the same day. Stay away from options for now. Do lots of homework each night on your stocks and in the morning wake up early and do more. Set realistic goals. Since most brokerages are commission free now, I recommend you start with no more than 40 bucks. If you can double that within two months, then you’re ready to start investing more...if you lose it then it’s not a huge deal. 

If you can make money off of a 40$ initial investment then you will realize how important a single penny can be in investing.",2020-04-09

You have accidentally stumbled into one of the most bizarre and dangerous corners of the financial markets! 

Here in Penny Stock land, with very few exceptions, you are either a newcomer or a victim.

Honestly, take your $200 and trade Blue Chip stocks for a while.",2020-04-09

However, it hit .97 in the PM before the market meltdown (where I exited at .93) and I am hoping it will retrace to at least there before the news, assuming the release doesn't come Monday morning.

If you mean the results are priced in, I can't see how. If the results are good, OGEN should hit $1.20 with ease, in my most conservative estimation, with $2-$3 not at all unobtainable.

This is especially true if they have licensing deals in hand, as it appears they may. AG013, with good results, will be far too valuable.

The current price, in my opinion, is 100% a result of the market meltdown and not at all a fair reflection of the stock's value with good results.

However there was a huge hype going on that day because originally the company accidentally released an announcement about providing covid testing instead of the first anouncement so the testing news was quickly removed but there were screen shots circulating. Then speculation started boiling down to whether or not it was fake news? I was in at .33 cents for the announcement they made earlier and then they rereleased the covid testing announcement in AH.,2020-04-09
