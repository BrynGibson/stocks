For this phase II asset they‚Äôre probably looking at $350-450m, maybe $500m on great conditions. Did you make a model/projection or are your estimates just completely random numbers? ",2018-09-03
6,Ryael,e5blgbp,/r/pennystocks/comments/9chpdx/the_potential_in_galt/e5blgbp/,1,"I think the lower end of the scale is more reasonable but the cancer data and fetch price is such an unknown. Early NASH estimates are $3 billion in revenue the first year alone and the total market is estimated to be $35-40 billion in 2025. 1.5-3 million people in the US alone have NASH without varices at any given time.

The cancer side is way more interesting and nearly 100% guesswork on my part. Keytruda results were nearly doubled at 2 &amp; 4 mg of GR-MD-02 and we are awaiting 8 mg dose results. If that increases or even remains in similar territory we are talking about billions a year. And that‚Äôs only pairing, GR-MD-02 could be its own broad spectrum treatment. Keytruda brought in $1.46 billion in sales in Q1 of this year alone and that has been growing rapidly. Even if it were to only be paired up with Keytruda, which it won‚Äôt be, and it doubles the success rate we are talking about annual revenues in a similar ballpark of $4-8 billion for their market alone.

I think $2.5 billion is met easily IF they can secure a buyout. The ceiling is much more interesting and unsure.",2018-09-03
