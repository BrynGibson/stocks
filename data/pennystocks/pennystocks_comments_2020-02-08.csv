There's a reason why the algos are so empty on the swing side, that shit is pro. You should risk as little as possible and build a trades list that is several thousand trades long before even beginning to think you know what your doing. If your trades cost more than 1cent per share, don't even think about it. You should be able to take ticks out, then quarters, then dollars. The ticks pay for the quarters, the quarters pay for the dollars, the dollars pay for the big swings. It's a business. From there, you scale it up in the futures. First as a 1 lot trader but the sky is the limit. That's how the floor guys learned back in the day, gambling for ticks in a busy pit with client orders.",2020-02-08
