“We are very pleased with the performance of Direct Solar and their entire team. Sense closing the acquisition they have really outperformed everyone’s initial expectation. They goal was $1,000,000 a month after 90 days and it would appear, we are going to hit that sooner than anticipated. In addition to this major success in residential the team is also working on a small business funding relationship that would provide Direct Solar the ability to qualify small business customers and lend out up to $100,000,000 for solar projects. The funding for this market is very sparse right now and we believe this option with our funding partner will put us in the leadership position to attack this major market,” states Wil Ralston, President SinglePoint.
