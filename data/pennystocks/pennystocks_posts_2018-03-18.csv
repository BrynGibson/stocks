2,Advice for a passive penny stock trader?,85deee,twintowersrubble,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85deee/advice_for_a_passive_penny_stock_trader/,3,15,"Hey guys, what kind of resources do you guys use to research penny stocks that you feel are worth investing in? For me personally, I would like to know how I can passively maintain a penny stock portfolio, while also working a full time job, where I might not have a lot of time to pay attention to charts and news.
