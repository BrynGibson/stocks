12,Today's massive runner and how I longed it $AETI,a2snha,evil326,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a2snha/todays_massive_runner_and_how_i_longed_it_aeti/,1,5,"I know a ton of people use the ""gap n go"" strategy but honestly have tracked this pattern on tradervue and it doesn't make sense from a risk/reward aspect. I dont know why warrior trades keeps suggesting it to beginners. I really like to trade off flags with these massive runners ideally. Sometimes like today we will see it grinding up almost all day building a dynamic support (trending support.)  


As long as volume is there and the support is very trendy the risk/reward on these setups are huge. I made a video of the process I just explained for today's runner $AETI. Feel free to ask me questions or shit on it, I think the discussion around these runners are important going long side because so many short them but very few trade them long successfully.
