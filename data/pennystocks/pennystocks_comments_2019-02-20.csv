You will see tons of posts like this, especially for companies like PSIQ. Look back through the users reddit history and you will likely see a bunch of copy pasta posts.

 I've traded this way too when I first started trading.
While it may feel safe and easy to trade while it's range bound and seemingly predictable, remember to protect yourself from downside when the price falls below the support level. And of course, when it breaks the range going up, it will likely shoot up and you may miss money on the table if you pre-set the profit taking. 
Anyway that's my 2 cents",2019-02-20

You might find it difficult to accumulate enough stock at 0.03 without moving the price higher.

And when you come to actually sell at 0.035, you'll need all the liquidity to be there to actually get paid that amount.

You will also have to pay commissions etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So in short, you have to factor in the effect of your own trading activity in the market. This strategy works on paper and with unlimited, cost-less liquidity (obviously), but it might not work in the real world.

What the hell happened to this company and why would someone even think about investing into it?  


Too late to invest ino them? I would say stay away.

Not a lot of people here truly believe in a company. They just want to make money in the end. They just look for positive news so they can validate and rationalize their decision to put money in.


And all those highs you're seeing are just inflated because of reverse splits and dilution. At the time the stock price was probably the same as it is now, but at some point it dropped below 1 dollar and a reverse split was made to bring the price over 1 dollar again. This has happened several times which explains why it looked like it was worth hundreds. ",2019-02-20
