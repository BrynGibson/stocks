Is it just getting started, or should I sell now?",celf73,Muffinizer1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/celf73/my_brother_told_me_to_buy_some_random_mining/,79,53,"I bought a little over $400 which was a decent amount of money for me at the time, at least to be spending on some random thing my crazy brother told me about. I paid $0.08/share, and now it's $0.24. In the single day I waited to post this, it went up 40%. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I could cash out. Given that I know nothing about copper mining, $800 is nothing to complain about. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it seems like maybe there's still potential here? AFAIK it's mooning over \[this HuffPo article\]([https://www.huffpost.com/entry/montana-copper-mine-black-butte\_n\_5d1a107fe4b082e5536d0174](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/montana-copper-mine-black-butte_n_5d1a107fe4b082e5536d0174)) giving the project some publicity, but also it seems like after many years, the mine is actually going to happen. Would I be stupid to sell so early on given the potential upside here?

&amp;#x200B;

I did a bit of digging, but I really don't know what I'm doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main Sandfire is an Australian ticker ASX: SFR that is apparently \[doing some shit in Alaska\]([https://www.finnewsnetwork.com.au/archives/finance\_news\_network233443.html](https://www.finnewsnetwork.com.au/archives/finance_news_network233443.html)), but I think that's somehow unrelated to Sandfire Resources America. Sandfire America is listed on TSX as SFR.V. Do I have that right?

&amp;#x200B;

Some numbers, though.  

&amp;#x200B;

Average volume on SRAFF has been about $6k/day. That's literally nothing. SFR.V is a little better, but still super low. 

&amp;#x200B;

The market cap isn't all that low though. According to Yahoo, it is valued at $197M. This seems kinda high, especially considering the main thing this company does is push for the Black Butte project.  Reading their last financial report, there's a lot of weird shit going on with warrants, options, holding company privilege that all amounts to them diluting from 503,281,865 to 817,833,031 shares in the last year alone. And I kinda doubt that a company ends up having 503M shares to begin with by some sort of accident.  

&amp;#x200B;

The final concern is that they were literally shitposting on Stocktwits in 2012 about their mining project. See for yourself (The ticker used to be TINTF): [https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TINTF](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/TINTF)
