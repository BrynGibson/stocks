But im not so sure if they will be a good long term hold, but i do like the prospects.

I think you guys all really don't understand what this company does.  It's a pure prospecting company.  They own land and/or rights to land that may or may not have accessible lithium deposits.  This company is literally a decade from producing a penny in revenue.  And in the meantime, it will dilute the SHIT out itself raising capital.  Why, you may ask?  Because mining takes so much fucking money to get started.  

It's not at all surprising that the stock hasn't moved despite the drilling news.  You you think their actually drilling for lithium production in Ollague?  NO!  They're still looking for the lithium!

All this said, there is money to be made because of all the uneducated retail investors that get excited because they think they've found a literal gold mine.",2018-06-22
