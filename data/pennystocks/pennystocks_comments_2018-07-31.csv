We all wish we had sold post phase 2b results last time and bought back in.  Hindsight 20/20.  But why did most of us buy this stock?  For the expected success of ATB-346.

This is a more or less binary stock.  The drug either is successful or is not.  If not, the entire pipeline becomes questionable.  Citagenix doesn't have a lot of value but would keep stock from actually going to 0.  If successful, big pharma is needed to run phase 3 because of the large cost associated and CEO was explicit at shareholder meeting about exit strategy being partner or buyout.  The company values the pipeline in the billions per their website.  The last major NSAID to come to market was heavily advertised and sold 1.5B in its first year of sales.  With expected patent life of 9 years or so, Antibe isn't going to sell out for under 1B.  Perhaps they choose to partner instead and get 10% royalty on 1B sales to be conservative.  That's 100M a year in profit as big pharma is running the show and we are just collecting royalty cash.  A 10 p/e then values us at 1B.  Fully diluted share count around 260M was always to be assumed as we are only invested for the hopes of success of the drug, thus all options and warrants exercised, hence their value of being granted to execs who brought us success and financiers for putting up private equity.  This yields and almost $4 share price.  Day to day ups and downs are just people trading paper for the myriad reasons they do.  Long term success of this drug doesn't depend on paper traders and Antibe's negotiations with big pharma will rest on science, not share price.",2018-07-31

I'd be too afraid of a pharma with nsaid on market already realizing this drug could significantly hurt their bottom line and swooping in to steal this up before we all think Antibe is done with it.  I don't think there is a good chance of that happening, but the very possibility is enough for me to not want to get caught with my pants down.",2018-07-31

Though anything in the .20's for the potential of this stock is a great deal.  Depending on the board you are watching, a lot of people hopped in during the 0.40's and they will probably happily buy shares in the .20's to average down there share cost.  As for me, I've been in since before the Phase 2b results dropped and I see the potential of this stock.  The company is fully funded to finish this study for part 1 and 2 of phase 2b.  We already know from the Phase 2A trial that the WOMAC scores were unreal; if the Phase 2b Part 2 WOMAC scores are outstanding, as expected, but during a 200 patient double blind study, were well into the money.  Only remaining part is the FDA approval post Phase 2b which is what ATE considers the conclusion of Phase 2.  They are taking their time to align the results to ensure FDA does not deny, hence the updated Phase 2b Part 1 Metobolic study.  In short, as we get closer each day to April 2019, I do not think you'll see shares in the 20's for long, as I will happily buy if even to hold and sell before Phase 2b Part II results are published.

94,silverwhere81,e3frm52,/r/pennystocks/comments/93dm30/antibe_therapeutics_provides_clinical_development/e3frm52/,1,"Other than yesterday and today, the volume has been tight.  Not sure what your holding, but if anyone was to unload 50,000 shares, its hard to see how you could even find the volume at the price.  I bought another 20,000 a little over a week ago at 30.5, but couldn't fill the initial 30,000 request at that limit.  So sell high and buy low can work, but depending on your amounts, you could get priced out and lose.  Also, while I hardly have a prediction on how low or high this stock will go.  Given the company is fully funded to find out our potential lotto ticket with time being the only variable.  If the stock does dip, a lot of us are coming into buy shares.  I tried to fill at 0.275 today and there wasn't much on Level 2 TSX.  In short, any dips will be bought up quickly, and any rises will be sold quickly given out timeline.  I'm thinking a lot of people will miss the boat as a lot of people are now in on the stock and holding. Watch the volume lock up next week to 200K - 300k shares a day again.",2018-07-31
