8,Insider Buying at Ring Energy,d9w3ua,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d9w3ua/insider_buying_at_ring_energy/,0,2,"I was recently sent a message about insider buying at Ring Energy and I have to say that it looks intriguing.  Insiders were big sellers up until last year.  Then this year, after the stock fell below $5 they started to buy, at an accelerating rate.

Financials on yahoo show several years of strong growth of revenues and profitability and the company has a cheap valuation with a PE ratio less than 6.  

Recent insider purchases have been a little below yesterdays close at $1.79 but it still looks worth a look.  Does anyone have an insight?
