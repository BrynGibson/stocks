11,KULR Technology Group Announces Partnership with Leidos to Supply NASA with Lithium-Ion Battery Storage Solution for International Space Station,cz4x7k,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cz4x7k/kulr_technology_group_announces_partnership_with/,2,1,"Successful Space Certification of KULR's Thermal Runaway Shield Paves Way for NG-12 Launch in October 2019

CAMPBELL, Calif., Sept. 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúKULR‚Äù), a leading developer of next-generation thermal management technologies, announced its Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) storage solution to safely store laptop lithium-ion batteries on the International Space Station (ISS), in partnership with Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), a FORTUNE 500¬Æ science and technology company, for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Leidos‚Äîin a $159 million, single-award cost-plus fixed-fee contract with NASA‚Äîis applying multiple technology innovations such as KULR‚Äôs Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) to improve capabilities for cargo planning, processes and packing that provide the ISS with cost-effective solutions in a dynamic and challenging operating environment.

In 2019, Leidos procured KULR‚Äôs TRS for NASA to support testing of its TRS in storage bags to protect laptop computer battery packs on board the ISS. These bags, each containing two laptop battery packs, are typically stored adjacent to one another. If one of the batteries enters into a state of thermal runaway, the resulting temperatures will increase to the point where thermal runaway is initiated in any neighboring bag as well, overheating all nearby laptop batteries. Until now, additional empty bags had to be placed between occupied bags to reduce the amount of heat radiated.

Tests of the TRS within the fireproof bags began in 2019, and were found to absorb enough thermal energy in the tightly packed scenario to prevent thermal runaway in the populated adjacent bags. This was a significant difference from previous tests run without the KULR TRS, and met the fireproofing requirements.‚ÄúKULR has provided a key component to the efficiency of the thermal management solutions we are developing for NASA,‚Äù said Daniel Barineau, Senior Project Manager, at Leidos. ‚ÄúKULR‚Äôs thermal management technology should have applicability beyond this one implementation, both on the ISS and future destinations. Thermal management solutions are crucial to the safety and security of all missions, and we are pleased to see another effective use of KULR‚Äôs technology. The TRS is being flight certified now and the bags will fly on a resupply mission to the ISS on NG-12 in October 2019.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlongside what is another successful space application with our world-class strategic partners, we are rapidly transitioning TRS and our other proprietary technologies into mass market commercialization. In addition to working with global automakers to utilize our disruptive TRS technology for next-gen electric vehicles, we progress towards offering the transportation and logistics industry with the safest, cost-effective way to store and ship lithium-ion batteries and products containing them. We are working closely with regulatory agencies and the private sector in this regard,‚Äù said Michael Mo, Chief Executive Officer of KULR Technology Group. ‚ÄúEach and every successful collaboration provides new opportunities to further applications for a diverse array of consumer products including electric vehicles, e-scooters, smartphones, laptops, and e-cigarettes. We look forward to providing our shareholders with further updates as these efforts continue to materialize.‚ÄùAbout KULR Technology Group, Inc.
