It's not the best idea... first off, it's hard to buy anything at .0001, there has to be a seller, and if there is a seller then that sht is prolly diluted... then set an automatic sell point at .0002... it could take forever....

I have a few stocks that I bought at .0002 months ago.... no volume, can't sell at .0003 and won't even sell at .0002.... might just lose that money...

But if you want to give it a try, don't put your eggs in one basket... spread $200 here and there... some can go up to .001 and then you're in the money...

Do your research!!!!

52,Ra_7,dx1i74f,/r/pennystocks/comments/86ppci/question_about_buying_stocks_at_00001/dx1i74f/,1,So.. I've personally found that the price generally drops after a reverse split. For example Magnegas (MNGA) stock on 1-16-18 was trading for $.34 per share. Then it underwent a 15-1 reverse split on 1-17-18.  The stock price went from .35 to 5.25 (.35 × 15). That was the second reverse split that MNGA underwent and their stock price has pretty much been dropping continuously since. Currently MNGA is trading around $.87 per share. I find that reverse splits tend to lose buyers' confidence and tends to dilute stock prices overall.,2018-03-24
