1,vakavaka,ewnl5v2,/r/pennystocks/comments/cp5t1g/long_vuzi_and_ttcm/ewnl5v2/,1,TTCM is pretty incredible for just getting in the market. They need to get some artists playing around with it. That will blow minds,2019-08-12

4,Anarkrist,ewo536k,/r/pennystocks/comments/cp5t1g/long_vuzi_and_ttcm/ewo536k/,1,"The app has a looooong way to go before it blows anyone's mind on any platform. The concept is solid and, potentially, a game changer, but still early in development as far as features and practicality go.

The team claims an uplisting is coming (OTCQB), and have been updating the app consistently. They said that ARKnet has been approved for TradeMark, and that development on 1.1 is done, with the rollout for 1.2 coming soon. I'm not involved in beta testing, so I have limited knowledge of what functionality 1.2 will bring, but I believe David LaMountain claimed that the social media functionality was being beta tested, and should roll out in 1.2 at some point.

Also, this company has another app, Klickzie, that has been in long-term development. Some kind of block-chain photography tech. May be released soon. Can't really speak on that.

I made a lot of money off of the launch, sold out, and have reinvested sub .015, but not heavily. I like how active the TTCM team is on social media, interacting with users, and I like how open they are with future updates and vision. That said, this is not a ""slam dunk"" investment, and should be treated as such. I have been underwhelmed with the capabilities of the app thus far, but the potential is solid. IF you invest, you are investing upon potential, and nothing more...",2019-08-12
