It seems the market is slowly finding out about this play - not often you get these numbers sub $1.  The TSX was halted wide friday around lunch because a server issue - so it probably would've finished in the .30s IMO.  Anywho - I found this wicked gem and so far with all my due diligence it looks like a winner.  Thoughts? The tradable float is 60ish mill, 13 mill shares in escrow for future acquisitions.  So the float is quite reasonable - love it!  The ticker symbol is sexy as well =)

r/CaptainChivalry alerted AXXA first 6 days ago and wished I would have followed it closer. Thing ran faster than I have seen a stock run ever. Now it is at the breaking point where it could crack down hard or bounce back up. This needs a special level of caution because this is a special level of volatile. On par with CELZ at its prime. Look for the dips and watch it close. 

CNCT is another wild runner but the volume died off late day. Emphasis on watch. Going to have to see if it recovers. 

BMXC is another otc multiday runner and who knows if it tries to stop tomorrow but for now no end in sight. Popped up for me after hours and will be watching it hard. 

UHLN is one of the new interesting ones I watched for a couple days only to be sad when I did not get in. Well it continues to run and repeat itself. I think it runs for at least Monday then we will reevaluate it. 

ANDI one of my old favorites as it made me a lot of money. Well the volume picked back up for it to new levels so one could actually get in and out remotely fast. Tried to get in before close and now I am sad. If you have a overnight I would say sell right away as it normally crashes in the morning when up like that. It turned out to not be a scam with the phone and I think it may recover a bit. ",2018-04-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ftt66/stocks_to_watch_for_monday_axxa_cnct_bmxc_uhln/
