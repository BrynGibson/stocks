0,Watchlist for Monday,a4ew9j,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a4ew9j/watchlist_for_monday/,1,6,"Coming up on my 9th year trading penny stocks, we enter the month of December. As stated in my previous post, there is usually a large quantity of penny stock traders in the month of January and February. This is partially due, based on my experience, as an increase in market participants given the extra income from Christmas money and tax returns. This money is invested in penny stocks, so we expect to see more volatility. I have a small list of momentum-driven penny stocks on Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

DOMO - This stock was up only 30% by market close on Friday, but be weary, since the overall trend on a macro scale indicates the stock is directed downward. I would certainly not invest in this one long-term (as is the case with most penny stocks).

&amp;#x200B;

OZM - This one is also headed downward. It has some previous resistance around $1.62, so if it can break this level, it could continue higher, but if not, watch for a crash.

&amp;#x200B;

UXIN - Again, this one spiked momentarily, but as you watch from my video on YouTube, this is a classic climax pattern. It's generated profitable gains for two consecutive days. And remember, most penny stocks have a maximum lifespan of 4 trading days before they crash on climax patterns. This has been the same behavior for the past 9 years I've been trading penny stocks.
