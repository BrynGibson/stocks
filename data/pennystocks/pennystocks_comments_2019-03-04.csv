Overall though I do like E*TRADE. I would try to put in a little more money. Find a commission free ETF get some gains there. And play with 500 dollars if you are able to or more.

There would be consistant gains consecutive days, weeks, months...then suddenly a drop overnight. I'd sooner ride a wave for a day, make 50% and bail at 5Pm, then hodl and get all my gains taken out while I'm asleep.

My main play was CIFS a üá®üá≥China stock .Did ok with it  in at 5$ out at 5.75$. I don‚Äôt know if this one is runner or not but it‚Äôs worth looking into.
KRFG  i still have a small stake in this and it is still on an uptrend .Made a new high and a higher low. I seen some people wanting to buy today but weren‚Äôt sure where .  .0054 to .005  should be support for tomorrow. A real good buy in is going to be .0045 
LEAS another good one with an uptrend. I think everyone is watching this one.i noticed that it needs to have high volume to move and it did that today. Something to look at tomorrow. Support is going to about .0068 .  A great buy in is at .0057  if you‚Äôre not in this one already go in with caution. It has some large dips.
ATIS hit my alert with volume. I set so many of these I never remember why.so I jump in with buy in mind . I only went in with 100$ . In at .50 out at . 60( I held to long) but the talk is this is a good one for a few days at least .Right now I see a flag which means it could go down after a small morning gain . If it stays above.40 it may have an uptrend for the week 
SWRM hit my alert late .it is starting to uptrend and may be a good play tomorrow 
      That‚Äôs my opinion and I wrote this for myself.
I hope this helps someone but always remember these are high risk stocks and you can lose money ",2019-03-04
