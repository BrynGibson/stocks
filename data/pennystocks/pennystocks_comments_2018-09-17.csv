my .02 with almost zero DD and a 30 second look at the charts., It's got 1 Billion shares outstanding and a MC of 4 Million.  keep it and hope for another pop, or sell it and find something else.  however, it's very liquid with avg volume of 95 Million so you shouldn't have any problem selling when if if it raises again.  in theory, based on previous patterns it could be up to .006 again around the 25th.
