And the ceo told me... we will pay you dividend in terms of shares in the new shell - basically another penny stock.

All in all - every reverse merger attempt in subpenny tickers is a scam.

Only 1/10000 is genuine.",2019-04-27

Generally true, but it's not *always* luck.  I've managed it, and not just once or twice.  More than a few times.  Of course while I like to *think* I did well because of my research and picks, maybe it's possible I'm just luckier than I think.  

Of course, had I not gotten out when I did in most of those plays, I'd have been screwed.  

Overall though good advice, and I agree with you on the whole.",2019-04-27

13,houseflip,elyhzbd,/r/pennystocks/comments/bhyiij/psa_on_the_wild_wild_west/elyhzbd/,1,5 fake press releases on the OTC last week. this is becoming a big problem and many do not even know its happening. LNGT TGRO last week among others. read TGRO's latest sec filing it says they were the target of fake news. by far the biggest underlying problem in the OTC and many do not understand these fake PR's are what is currently making the OTC so hard to trade. the rest is quite manageable.,2019-04-27

With gap downs a stock drops so fast it may not trigger the sell order , especially with free Commission brokers. Even with a payed broker if the gap breaks the stop it may not be sold till it hits a support and there is buyers . Now there become a line of sellers to buyers. Paid brokers get first dibs . Thatâ€™s why you had to change the order to sell at market . 
   Think of a stop loss as training wheels. Even if you have one you can still fall over if you turn the curve fast enough.",2019-04-27

The issue with OTC and pink market is that the transfer agents take so much time to update details like float, authorized shares etc that information up to date is not readily available and share structure is key to win in OTC and pink sheet markets.

Your best bet is penny stocks on Nasdaq and NYSE but you need to play them carefully as pump and dump is as rampant and reverse split is very much a reality.",2019-04-27
