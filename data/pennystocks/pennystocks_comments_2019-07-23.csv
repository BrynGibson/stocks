Embedded copyrights for images means art theft is preventable. I know the growing hotbed of online artists is jumping through hoops to protect their content, and this seems like a very good way to do that while potentially generating a secondary revenue source. I want to see how they execute their ad-based model and how they design their 'Fotofy' platform to streamline services for artists. Could be great, a ton of things can go wrong with this tech though. What I don't want to see is a 'Pinterest' thing where you're forced to log into the website just to view content found through google search. If Fotofy's going to succeed, it needs to be unobtrusive and inviting. Video ads for images are about the dumbest thing I've heard, I really hope they aren't serious about that. Everything else looks pretty good.

Specifically interested in how the 'image replacement' idea plays out. Could be revolutionary for artists whose work is posted off their websites. But again, people *will* actively avoid obtrusive ads.",2019-07-23

Note 2 ‚Äì Going Concern
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has insufficient cash on hand, a working capital
deficit of $2,786,389 and incurred net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $9,293,805 and
used $586,255 of cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2019. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently seeking
additional sources of capital to fund short term operations. The Company, however, is dependent upon its ability to
secure equity and/or debt financing and there are no assurances that the Company will be successful; therefore,
without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.",2019-07-23
