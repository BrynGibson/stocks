NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB:SMME) – Consumers want it. Credit Card Issuers need it.  Now consumer research shows consumers are willing to pay for a new credit card device that helps protect them from fraud.  According to an independent consumer survey commissioned by SmartMetric it was revealed that nearly 2 in 3 credit card users would pay $69.95 for a biometric credit.  The research shows the willingness of consumers to pay for a better more secure credit card with built in-side biometric security is fueled by consumers' concern over fraud.

“What we have created is a paradigm shift in the multi-billion dollar credit card industry.  The SmartMetric developed biometric card has turned the simple credit card into a new high-tech biometric secured device,"" said today SmartMetric’s President &amp; CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

Sales revenues for SmartMetric and Banks, for the new biometric credit card device with only 5 million cards sold, could be in excess of $250 million.  There are over 6 billion Chip Cards that the SmartMetric product is designed for, in use around the world.

From the U.S. CONSUMER PAYMENT STUDY by TSYS, “We know many consumers are concerned about card security. Although those of us in the industry recognize the security features which are in place with cards, we were interested in consumers’ perceptions and how they rank rewards compared to security. We were rather surprised at the response: 74 percent ranked security and fraud protection as their priority, with 26 percent preferring rewards.

26% Ranked #1 for rewards offered

74% Ranked #1 for security and fraud protection"" (1)

""This research is in line with our own independently commissioned research which shows 80% of a major brand's credit card holders are concerned with credit card and identity fraud,"" said today SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

SmartMetric has developed a fingerprint biometric credit card that uses the card holder's fingerprint to unlock the card as they insert the card into a retail point of sale card reader or ATM.

One of the features of the biometric card developed by SmartMetric is that it has a rechargeable battery inside which in turn allows the card to be used at both standard retail card readers as well as ATM’s.  This is an important product feature since while many credit card users may infrequently use their credit card in an ATM being able to do so is important for card customers.  Discussions with leading card issuing banks has confirmed that they would not be happy issuing a credit card that did not allow their customers to be able to use it in an ATM if they chose to, said Chaya Hendrick.

SmartMetric biometric cards are available to Banks in the United States through SmartMetric’s industry distributor, PROTEC Secure Card. PROTEC Secure Card (PSC), based in New Jersey, has years of experience in the Credit Card industry both in the USA and Latin America. PSC is an established Visa, MasterCard and Discover certified credit card manufacturer that specializes in advanced high-quality credit card production for card issuing Banks in the United States along with Central and Latin America.  The company is a leader using the most updated equipment and technologies in their secure production facility.
