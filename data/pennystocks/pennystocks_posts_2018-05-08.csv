2,MGON - Ready to RUN - Merger announcement tomorrow/ info on NEW management!,8hw3b1,Saints420Fan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8hw3b1/mgon_ready_to_run_merger_announcement_tomorrow/,2,21,"IVS recently attended a custodianship hearing to relieve old management of this defunct shell of a company. Low floater - looks primed for a run with news. IVS easily gained control and will announce TOMORROW info on new management! Only trading at .0138 so it’s still got few eyes on it, but Twitter is blowing up about it!!! Lot of chatter on iHub too. I’m taking a flier on it to see what company steps in. If it’s blockchain or GRDP related (See how LDSR and AXXA did?) it’ll be worth the gamble!  Should run to .02-.03 today and tomorrow with hype alone imo. IVS plays have ran well in the past so I like this one this week

CEO live interview tomorrow. Still checking them out for myself, but I bought in at .0005 with what I was ok with losing going in blind. I expect to invest more if it doesn't take off before I do more research. As always, do your own DD, it's worth a look.
