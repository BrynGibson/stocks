1,"Excelsior Mining (EXMGF) - Copper Mining, Production Start, No Debt",efri8d,Helotian,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/efri8d/excelsior_mining_exmgf_copper_mining_production/,1,1,"This one's a sleeper that should offer strong rewards at today's share price.  Excelsior Mining Co. just received green light from US EPA to start in situ (injection/extraction wells) mining of copper in mining friendly Gunnison, Arizona.  Minimal environmental intrusion and eco-friendly. Strong management team, institutional/insiders own nearly 60% of outstanding shares, trading at about 76 cents/share, no debt but well financed, expect first copper cathode plate production in Q1 2020, market cap/share price at significant discount to NPV.  Has high IRR.  25 million lbs/year - start (Stage I) production capacity.  Expect to go to 125 million lbs/year in about 4 to 6 years, maybe earlier.  Has one of the very lowest all-in cost ($1.63)/lb of copper produced due to low in situ mining method.  Low operating costs (no need for heavy digging equipment, labor, and has low post-mine reclamation cost).  Compare that all-in-cost against today's copper price ($2.82/lb) and you can see their high profit margin when copper plates are produced in Q1 2020.  Many analysts expect copper prices to increase from 2020 onwards due to electric vehicle demand (each EV needs 85 to 185 pounds of copper, depending on whether hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or battery electric) and insufficient supply to meet copper demand.

After Excelsior Mining demonstrates it can produce copper at facility's nameplate capacity and low cost/lb, expect larger mining firm to buy them out at price at least 4 times today's share price.

9,Tim Sykes' Challenge is a Scam,eg00nt,asclepius2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eg00nt/tim_sykes_challenge_is_a_scam/,1,73,"Just had a telephone interview for Tim Sykes' challenge. The interviewer asked questions like ""What are your goals?"" and talked about Tim's ""philosophy"" of needing to change your life and exit the rat race, all leading up to him having you write down your ""Commitment to Tim"", which includes:

1. Begin today - making these changes
2. Time - 10 hours per week
3. Tuition - $6,950
4. Never give up

The interviewer asked for my credit card info and I said the $6,950 was a lot and asked if I could sleep on it. Then he said Tim wants people who are ready to stop living according to the status quo, and that trading penny stocks wasn't right for me since I wasn't able to make a split second decision. I said that in penny stocks one informs oneself beforehand in order to make quick decisions, yet making such a rash financial decision without knowing too much about it *in any arena* is a poor choice. 

Just wanted to share in case anyone is thinking about the challenge",2019-12-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eg00nt/tim_sykes_challenge_is_a_scam/
