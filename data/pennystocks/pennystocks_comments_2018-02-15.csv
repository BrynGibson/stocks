I trade pennies because itâ€™s fun, itâ€™s more akin to educated gambling sometimes. I invest 1% of my portfolio in pennies - itâ€™s the yolo side of my portfolio. 

Overall Iâ€™ve just broken even to be honest. If you asked me yesterday I would have said Iâ€™m down 50%. Itâ€™s fun and fluctuations get the heart going; euphoria! 

Iâ€™m not financially stable enough to use real money in pennies. For now I make small moves and give most of my gains to commissions haha. ",2018-02-15

.another I have been with for years and still lose money is mint technology on the tsx venture exchange, mit is the ticker. They do payroll in the Middle East, I have been burned by this one in the past because they do a lot of ppâ€™s amd then get an outrageous amount of shares and then roll back and it has murdered the share price at times. I got back into it recently and they have made announcements about utilizing blockchain or creating there own blockchain.
