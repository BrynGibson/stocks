The week after next, they are essentially the stars of the show at the world‚Äôs largest professional conference on burn care, including the ‚Äúbest of the best‚Äù abstract. 

Approval for pediatric use is expected, maybe by the end of the year. 

Trials for many other indications are ongoing, so new labeling may be coming fast and furious. 

The potential for this for cosmetic uses (already happening in Europe) opens an ENTIRELY new ballgame in terms of sales potential. 

In their last half year financial report, sales were significant in the US, even though the product was only approved for the final 3 months of that 6-month period and they were still assembling their sales and commercial staff. 

Above and beyond the very real and important benefits to the patients themselves (significantly reduced scarring, faster healing, skin color returning to its natural shade, etc.), when insurance companies get deeper into the savings this treatment offers (reduced hospital stays, no constant home nursing/outpatient dressing changes during healing post-hospitalization, etc.) compared to current standard of care treatment, they are very likely to mandate or near-mandate this treatment just like they mandate generic drugs instead of brand name unless the doctor proves medical necessity and other similar situations where they mandate the most cost effective solution as long as outcomes aren‚Äôt compromised. So take that along with the fact that it‚Äôs not only cheaper but outcomes are actually IMPROVED? Well it‚Äôs a no brainer. 

Out of all the presentations going on at the upcoming conference, the one entitled ‚Äú‚ÄúBudget Impact of Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ACHD) Use versus Standard of Care (SOC) for Treatment of Severe Burns: A Case Study‚Äù is going to be the one that turns the most economic heads as far as this company‚Äôs future is concerned.
