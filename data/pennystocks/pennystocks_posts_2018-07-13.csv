2,CNSX: CROP - the infrastructure/real estate side of cannabis,8yj7hi,SofaKingNatty,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8yj7hi/cnsx_crop_the_infrastructurereal_estate_side_of/,1,1,"Wondering if anyone has any experience with, or DD on this company? My dad sent me this article [https://cropcorp.com/crop-tenant-plants-additional-20000-square-feet-of-recreational-cannabis-in-california-and-announces-first-harvest/](https://cropcorp.com/crop-tenant-plants-additional-20000-square-feet-of-recreational-cannabis-in-california-and-announces-first-harvest/) and I haven't had time to dig in, but at first brush:

* It's more of a brick &amp; mortar play with a cannabis spin - great for investors who are familiar with real estate and want some exposure to cannabis growth &amp; returns
* As a long-term investor in AP.UN (Allied REIT) I've always loved Allied because it's a nice real estate + tech play - Allied is the #1 most popular landlord among tech tenants in Canada, and they have their own class of office space. I feel like CROP could be a similar style of industry exposure.
* It seems like a ""selling pickaxes during the gold-rush"" style model
* I like the brick &amp; mortar play because of the stability of real estate 
* The model also looks sort of like ""contract brewing"" which happens a lot in the beer space for new brewery start-ups. 
* My only issue is I'm not sure how well-suited cannabis is for the aforementioned models because most LP's are able to  raise enough capital for infrastructure. Perhaps CROP will fill a gap on a per-state basis to infill, or perhaps they will be a resource which large LP's allocate to when they can't meet volume demands.
