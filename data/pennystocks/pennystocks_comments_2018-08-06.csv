Stocks are traded in various ways and the common understanding is buy when you, yes you, believe the stock is considered undervalued, and sold when you believe overvalued. There is money to be made through companies failures, this is called “shorting” in general, and money to be made on the upside, this is “going long”.

You should seriously consider taking $100 and depositing it into a Robinhood account. You do not have to be stupid like most of the folks at R/wallstreetbets but you can get free trading ability with aftermarket hours. Stay away from margin trading, stay away from naked options, dont always go with the crowd because generally the crowds the layman investor associates with more than likely will end up losing you money.",2018-08-06
