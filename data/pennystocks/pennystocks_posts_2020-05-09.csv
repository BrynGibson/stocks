Their debt is massive and apparently HTZ bonds are now trading at .20 on the dollar.  It seems to me there is good reason to believe they will not file for bankruptcy.  Those holding HTZ debt would take a substantial loss in bankruptcy given that used cars have substantially devalued recently.  Shareholders would be completely wiped out in bankruptcy.  It seems the only hope all stakeholders have is to hold on and hope the company comes back around.  Plus the largest shareholder- Carl Icahn- bought several million more shares back in March.  I can’t see him doing that and then just letting the company burn .  It seems worth the risk.,2020-05-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ggkpfi/anyone_else_taking_a_flyer_on_htz/

34,Outstanding Shares and Stock Floats,ggj9q3,mtmtrader,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ggj9q3/outstanding_shares_and_stock_floats/,1,6,"Every morning that the market is open I share a morning watchlist on social media with info such as news headlines, support levels, resistance levels, and number of outstanding shares for stocks that are making big moves. I get asked pretty frequently why I include the number of outstanding shares and how it is relevant for day trading stocks. I wanted to make this post to explain the importance of it and share how I use it in my own trading. Hopefully after reading this you'll see why I share this data on my watchlists and you'll check for this number before each of your trades because it can be very beneficial and is a simple way to help manage your risk in the market.

*Let's start with the obvious question you may have... what are outstanding shares?*

The number of **outstanding shares** is simply the total number of shares a publicly traded company has. This includes the shares that you and I can trade as retail traders, the shares that are traded and held by institutions/hedge funds/banks, and even the shares that are owned by company insiders. Anyone can very easily look up the number of outstanding shares a company has. You can do this in your trading platform, on websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or [finviz](https://finviz.com/), or you can look into the company's most recent earnings report and see the number directly from their [SEC filings](https://www.bamsec.com/). The screenshot below shows where the number of outstanding shares is located for $AAPL in the thinkorswim mobile platform on the right shows the same number located on the first page of $AAPL's most recent earnings report filing. You'll find this info in the same location for any spot, $AAPL was just use for this example.

[https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue](https://imgur.com/a/cTAkHue) 

Outstanding shares differs slightly from a stock's float, but the way that they affect the stock can go hand in hand. A stock's **float** is the number of shares available to be traded by the public, like you and I. You can find a stock's float by subtracting the total number of closely held shares *(by company insiders, employees, etc.)* from the total number of outstanding shares. Although traders seem to talk more about a stock's float than the number of outstanding shares, I personally like to focus more on the outstanding shares because it can be difficult to find accurate float data in a limited amount of time.

The reason for that is because a company does not directly state their float data in their SEC filings like they do their outstanding shares. This means that in order to get accurate float data, you have to research and find the number of closely held shares by digging through filings and then subtract that number from the total number of outstanding shares. You can look for a stock's float on 3 different websites like [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), [finviz](https://finviz.com/), and [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/) and many times you'll end up with 3 completely different numbers.

The number of outstanding shares may be more commonly used for calculating a company's market capitalization, but it's definitely a valuable number for short-term trading as well. This number can be thought of as the **supply**, and the volume for the stock can be thought of as the **demand**. When there is a low supply *(in this case meaning a low float or low amount of shares outstanding)* and high demand, generally there will be a larger amount of volatility in that stock compared to one with a larger supply.

For example, you can look at the number of shares outstanding for stocks with the largest % gain on any given day, and you will find that a large majority of them have less than 100 million shares outstanding. Now, 100 million isn't a magical number for picking big runners, but stock's with many more shares outstanding than that tend to have less volatility and less potential for huge runs in my experience. In fact, if you look back on the biggest supernovas from the past few years, you'll notice that they all had under 100 million shares outstanding, and many of them even having less than 10 million shares. In the screenshot below you can see the huge spike in the stock **$DRYS** from 2017 when it went from under $5 to over $100 in just a few days. Since then $DRYS has done many reverse splits and offerings, but at the time it had a very low float of only around 1 million shares.

[https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq](https://imgur.com/a/H3gEdyq) 

As you can see, volatility doesn't just work on the upside though. $DRYS, like many big runners, came down just as quickly as it went up. That's why trading low floats with higher volatility can create a higher risk, higher reward situation. With that being said, one of the ways I use the number of outstanding shares is to give myself an idea of the stock's expected volatility. If it has a low supply, I most likely will trade a smaller-than-usual position size to **reduce my risk** in the trade that is expected to be highly volatile.

In my opinion, this is especially important with longer-term trades and investments. Generally the goal of an investment is to profit from a slow and steady rise over a long period of time. If you're investing in stocks with a low number of outstanding shares, you'll most likely have to deal with much more volatility and larger drawdowns in your positions. Aside from the dilution, poor financials, and frequent pump and dumps, this is one of the reasons that penny stocks do **not** make good investments, even though they can be great for short-term trading and scalping.

**Price Action &amp; Target**

This might not be an immediate stock that you look to flip, I don't look for MVIS or UAVS type plays, however I do think that VSTM is an interesting play. The stock peaked to a high of over $4 per share less than a month ago before falling to less than $2. Therefore I feel this is a good time to get in and based on the chart from a technical analysis, has been in the accumulation stage since the drop. It has been steadily rising last week from $1.80 to over $2.00, volume has increased massively and, despite the Biotech sector booming at the moment, still trades at less than 2x cash value and at the moment anything under $2 seems like a great entry point. Daily volume has also been rising to over 17 million.

Insider purchases in the last 6 months total -  5,752,6514 shares ( 1,301,300 sold) with a total of 28.23% of Shares Held by Institutions.

Based on a technical standpoint alone, I would hope this would hit $3 in the short term given the increase in volume and extremely steady accumulation phase it's going through however I intend to hold out longer on it with the aim of a potential buy out given SEC filings and the increase in insider buying and tute ownership.

I enjoy doing research and would love to contribute more to this sub so if there's any other tickers you want me to look at please let me know!",2020-05-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ggnk2d/vstm_quick_dd/

It’s also surfaced some wise ones stating 10%-30% returns on a stock make a good investor. That’s still a high return percentage. 

So, it had me thinking. 

If I was to make a solid 10% return with an initial 1,000$ investment how many trades would it take to turn that 1,000$ into 10,000$? 
That sounds pretty good. 10,000$. 
———————————————————————-
It takes 25 trades with 10% returns starting with 1000$
It takes 50 trades with 10% returns starting with 100$
————————————————————————
Some trades fly by 10% with a blink and yet we hold only to lose it and then some. Be patient, diligent, especially with DD, focus on your goal, and those 26-50 trades are going to fly by in no time.

The reason for the dip on Friday can be explained by 2 factors. The first is profit taking by some who got in at $4-6 in March that saw this as a peak, I do not blame them, but this stock is just getting started. The second factor is that a sell wall was set up at $10 by short sellers to keep the day under $10. There is a large short interest in this stock currently trying to manipulate the price. 

Now that I have explained the downtrend it’s time to tell you why the stock will crush on Monday and the next few months. The numbers for new guidance that were presented are modest at best. The company is factoring in sales being pulled forward from Christmas to now. This assumption is inaccurate due to two major factors. The first being that sales of consoles has been raised 155% since lockdown and the demand for headsets has followed that to an extent, however the demand for headsets will be more elongated as those who skipped out on a headset with their initial purchase realize the value of the product. This also plays heavily in turtle beach’s favor, because a consumer that elects not to buy a headset due to extra cost initially and then in the future purchases one will likely buy a product in the sub $50 market where turtle beach dominates the market. The second factor is the launch of new consoles. Older model headsets will be compatible with the next gen console, however when a consumer elects to spend $400-500 on a gaming system it is easier to justify a $50 purchase to enhance your new product. This will be similar to the Fortnight boom the company experienced only this time enhanced by the release of new consoles. 

Ok so the stock is up 58% in the last month are the insiders cashing out? No, insiders have been accumulating shares over the past months.

I forgot to mention they gained 500 points of market exposure in their main market, and gained exposure outside of the gaming market. Oh yeah and $0 debt!

Ok so I showed why this is a good longterm investment now why would Monday be a huge day? The factors above combined with a big dip on Friday will lead to high interest in this stock on Monday. When this interest depletes the short’s sell wall at $10  a break out will begin. This breakout will be amplified as the large short interests start to buy shares to close positions. “Short squeeze” 

To be transparent I do have calls on this stock.

100 BMRA - This company has a rapid test kit for Covid-19 that can confirm results in 10 minutes currently being reviewed by the FDA. If approved, this stock will go up. If not, it will crash to \~2.50

300 IZEA - Releasing the influencer creation platform along with integrating with twitch.

1,000 INUV - Because I have firm belief in AI for the future, and like to diversify into many companies,  and they received federal aid for covid.

200 FET - Lowered debt in last period, earnings report losses not as bad as expected, at a low due to oil crisis.

I'm a broke college student and about a month ago I put $100 into a robinhood account trying to make some cash. Since then I've grown to $175 (yes, I know it's chump change). Anyways, I'm finally getting more comfortable putting proportionally larger amount of money into individual stocks, and on Monday I plan on making my largest buy so far. I have completed my own DD, but I want the community's opinions on what stock they think is a good pick. Currently considering SHIP, TAT, TTI, and getting back in on KTOV.

I reentered at .45 and holding until mid Wednesday.  I'm not saying to sell or whatever, but i wouldn't hold long on this. It will rise, but I've set a trail sell limit at 10% dip. Good news are being circulated, and I've watched this stock since 3 months ago, so I'm a little surpised how much info popped up when the stock is on the rise.  I'm not complaining, just saying. I'll take your downvotes if you only wish for good news. This is the 3rd UAVS or thr 2nd MVIS for me, i lost uavs but gained mvis, so I'm not complaining. Just fyi, i bought all 3 stocks before there were hypes.

Here is one that is gaining traction that you should have some love for: TTI. There's more meat on this bone compared to Ktov, so if you had to choose between the two, i would recommend TTI.

Both will gain 17% to 20% this coming week, so make your gains and don't get bullied or trapped into bag holding.

End rant and cautionary tale. Please share your thoughts on these stocks:

1. Dffn
2. Phun
3. Ktov
4. Tti
5. Mara
6. Fet
7. Nxtd
8. Csu
9. Tops (I'll skip SHIP)
10. Nbrv

Cumulatively, I'm holding over 20k in all the 10 stocks above. My goal isn't to the moon, maybe to the top of Everest. 20 to 25% gain and I'm out. My personal belief is penny stocks are pennystocks for a reason, they are trash. But, once in a while, trash can be made into cash if one knows when to enter and exit.
