FOR IMMEDIAE RELEASE:
 
To Our Valued Clients:
 
We are truly sorry for the interruption in business caused by the unexpected suspension of our licence by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (""SCB""). The suspension is intended to be temporary pending the resolution of a few concerns recently raised by the SCB.
 
The SCB has scheduled a meeting with the firm's management for Tuesday, September 24th, to discuss their concerns and our proposed resolutions. We believe that we will have a productive meeting.
 
The concerns expressed to us are not about the firm's liquidity or solvency. We confirm that we are able to very easily meet our obligations.
 
We hope to return to normalcy by mid next week.
 
Thank you,
 
Management‚Äù",2019-09-24

An offering is an offering regardless. It means the company is offering their shares in quantity to someone at a cheaper price than what you can currently buy them at. So in turn they will be dumped on the common investor (you and I) for profit. Doesn't sound like a lot of upside",2019-09-24

4. More governance scandals like Canntrust &amp; Aphria 
5. Some huge greenhouses coming online very soon. Not only the big guys but also Auxly, Aleafia, Hexo, others. Combined with cheap imports, margins will get squeezed
6. Black market is still flourishing 
7. Increased competitiveness and low barriers to entry again squeezes margins
8. At these cheap valuations, some private equity and other companies can buy companies on the cheap. Sure, this is also a positive but how happy will bagholders be when the newcomers buy equity stakes for pennies on the dollar of what they paid back in January?

Lots of positive catalysts as well. Revenue growth will remain, I‚Äôm sure we will see positive EBITDA from strong companies in the near future, better branding, more partnerships, etc. but a lot of risk remains.",2019-09-24

But yes, now is a great buying time. 

$ACB is also the only one that is close to positive EBITDA, and the only one with an EPS that isn‚Äôt negative. 

I think this next quarter will be the one where they break out. EBITDA will be positive, EPS will be positive. 

The one drawback to $ACB is that it‚Äôs the most diluted of the major pot stocks.",2019-09-24

Canada‚Äôs cannabis market is just starting and is only partially open. Once edibles go legal just wait to see what sales do. Looking at Colorado as an example, all the money and future growth is in cannabis derivatives, not dry flower. Plus Ontario only has a handful of stores. Fast forward 2 years when the market has matured and you‚Äôll wish you bought at $5. 

Yes the stock may go down in the short term due to FUD, the vaping health issues or some other reason, but ACB and others are strong companies that have just started to turn the tap on.",2019-09-24
