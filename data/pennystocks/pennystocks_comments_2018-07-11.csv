Yes you would buy TGLO.

Delfin will likely change the ticker name after the process is complete. At this point the speculation isn't so much around whether the RM is happening but how it will affect current shareholders.

A shell company is basically a publicly listed company that someone keeps current in the event a private company wants to skip the IPO process and expedite their public debut at a cheaper cost.

The fact they picked TGLO over any other shell is interesting in part because of the history behind the ticker.",2018-07-11

70,DesignPrime,e341aiq,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e341aiq/,1,"&gt;In their first report since the transaction in January, the shell released a filing that mentioned Delfin over 40+ times. Essentially, the filing was representative of Delfin as if they had already taken over the shell company with intent to use. But this was still speculation. Another factor that was noted by a team of individuals on a separate board was that in that same filing, there were clauses that mentioned NASDAQ listing requirements and compliance thereof. These were low in frequency and really amounted to not much more than an increase in speculation of what was to become of the shell.

This speculation was chaotic as one side said even if the company were to use the shell, they would only use it to raise money then drop it at an instant. Or that they would r/s the stock into oblivion and beyond with something akin to a 100:1 r/s leaving current shareholders holding the bag before the big bang.

Few questions if you don't mind,

Where can I find this report by back in January? I would be interested to read through this myself.

How do reverse mergers work? 

I read the gist of it googling for about half an hour where the private company is essentially driving to save money by using a shell company and bypassing the IPO altogether. What I am wondering is how the shares of the shell company will be valued if a reverse merger occurs. Is it instant spike in value? I feel there is something here; something to the effect of reverse splits where you don't actually get the inflated return. It seems too good to be true where the return can spike 30x overnight.

I'll probably throw just a few hundred bucks in this for fun/speculation but part of me wants to spend more time researching. If there are any other resources I can dig into this, do let me know. This will be fun to speculate and follow along.",2018-07-11
71,DesignPrime,e341fff,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e341fff/,1,Good point about just investing in the team. How many shares are you in?,2018-07-11
72,potatoclump,e350eg1,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e350eg1/,1,"Ok so the filings are all in the SEC.gov website just search Edgar search tools for theglobe.com and you can find all filings for TGLO. The first report I mentioned that has Delfin in it over 40 times is the 10K they released in March I believe.

There is a lot of DD about who owns what percentage of shares in the shell currently. Delfin holds 70.9%, Enbridge for sure holds 5% and Talisman Global Investments holds two large stakes in an undisclosed investment as they are split between two hedge funds and are under $100mil each so they have no requirement of disclosure but as far as anyone knows Talisman is only currently involved with Delfin.

The float of TGLO is speculated to be immensely low as the price fluctuations against small volume seem to indicate most of the shares are locked up by someone. There's no telling exactly how many shares the big players in this RM own for sure right now but it's believed that insiders and related parties own up to 85% conservatively.

If you talk about value there are several factors at play. First is the base value of Delfin as a private company. Delfin had filed a tax form of which $400 per million dollars of value is required in taxes for the state of Delaware which the filing was released. If you calculate backwards the taxes paid you can arrive at a $336mil valuation for the base private company. Additionally, Enbridge signed over the UTOS pipeline segment in the gulf to Delfin in exchange for 5% equity in the project. The value of the pipeline was $400million at the time. So obviously for Enbridge to get back their investment they'd need a 20x increase in the valuation of Delfin over $400mil which would bring the total valuation up to $8bil for Enbridge to break even on a 5% equity stake. It's also worth noting that the raw asset value of the pipeline in operation is worth $1.65bil alone.

There's a lot more I can get into but based on that factor alone you can calculate a 123x return over the current market cap which means even if there is a 100:1 r/s you would still break even or make a small profit.

Now assuming a complete merger of all assets and the whole Delfin project, there are additional value factors that can come into play. For example, they received a $1.5bil loan from South Korea to fund the project. They also signed a contract with China to export 3mil mtpa of LNG over 15 years which comes out to roughly $12bil in total revenue and $800mil per year. So if you take into account fair valuation based on a multiplier of revenue and cash of around 10x you can get a conservative market cap of about $62bil. This includes the pipeline, cash investments, loans, and revenue of the China contract. Which would be 997x return over the current TGLO market cap. So unless you think a 1000:1 r/s is realistic you'll likely make some money should the RM actually happen.

If it was more of a probability chance at x% return it would be more intriguing than having the reverse split lower the overall return.,2018-07-11

77,potatoclump,e35jevj,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e35jevj/,1,"It's a lot more complicated than that. You have to understand what kind of ownership a company going through a RM is looking for and what kind of share structure is common amongst currently publicly traded companies, the shares owned by retail vs private insiders or investors and consider a range of ratios that would be reasonable for a r/s then compare that against the potential increase in market cap if the private company merged into the public company which in this case is TGLO which trades with a market cap between 45-65mil. Delfin is worth 336 excluding the UTOS pipeline so that alone gives you a break even if the r/s is 5:1. But there's honestly no real way to figure out what kind of r/s if any will happen so I'm not going to lie and tell you you'd make xxx% return",2018-07-11
78,potatoclump,e35k48w,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e35k48w/,1,"I will say that typically a company's target ownership for a RM is 85% which is what it looks like may be the case for Delfin already. They certainly already have 80% in the hands of the company, directors and CEO. Because of this I think the r/s will be minimal if there is one at all and with the estimated value of current investments by Enbridge and Talisman, the UTOS pipeline and their permit to export to non-FTA countries, partnership with Bechtel, loan from South Korea, contracts with Poland and china, there is great potential for the market cap to hit tens of billions if not more. 46,200% over current SP. or it could be a huge flop. Up to you to decide",2018-07-11

80,potatoclump,e3656im,/r/pennystocks/comments/8xveog/tglo_the_comeback_kid/e3656im/,1,"I don't think they're comparable at all. Delfin has an edge on Tellurian in more ways than one. For example, TELL doesn't have a permit to export LNG yet despite them thinking they're going ahead with the production of ships and terminals. The DoE just came out and said delays are to be expected in the processing of permit requests which could take anywhere from 1-2 years. The permit Delfin has is the only permit that has been granted for an LNG exporter to do business with countries outside of a free trade agreement with the United States, putting their business far ahead of competitors. This permit is good for 15 years or more as long as they're using it. The permit can be considered priceless but the real value it will bring will become more clear as they sign contracts around the globe.

TELL also doesn't have any pipeline assets available or ready to be used in order to transport LNG to a terminal for export and they're in the early stages of engineering studies to build one. The UTOS pipeline Delfin will be using has been maintained by Enbridge and will need a few valve modifications to reverse the flow of LNG out into the gulf where the LNG terminals will be sitting. The raw asset value of the UTOS pipeline that Enbridge dumped into Delfin alone is worth 75% of the current market cap of TELL.

The company TELL RM into also had a completely different share structure which wouldn't have allowed for the liquidity they needed in order to raise funds for their project. The shareholders were diluted because TELL needed more shares in the market in order for investors to show any interest. TGLO has somewhere around 450 million outstanding shares of which 85% are likely owned by Delfin and any equity to insiders. This leaves around the same amount of shares that TELL dumped into the market with their RM dilution.

The before/after on TELL was that old shareholders investments were worth 3% of what they were before the RM. The dilution amounted to a 33:1 split if you want to look at it that way even though it wasn't technically a r/s.

They both are RM but that's where the similarities end so you can't really gauge a direct comparison of the two and come out with any meaningful insight into how the situation with Delfin will work out.",2018-07-11
