3,3rd alert on shippers,dd92ov,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dd92ov/3rd_alert_on_shippers/,4,0,"How bout it folks. I started an early position on shippers this year to be ahead of the game. As of today I’m up 20%, 7%, &amp; 23% on the ones I picked. Though they have fluctuated over this time it’s important to note the accumulation over the past few days. I’m not sure how high this year will spike but I do know the chatter is heating up.  This is an obvious pump that is somewhat predictable. I am in DCIX, ESEA, and GLBS,  I did not get in PXS but I wish I had.             
If this years pump happens, and I’m 10 grand in believing it will, then there are two things to know.
    One is that there’s still time to get a good position. Two is that we are weeks to days away from it firing up. 
     Read up and research if you decide to get in on the right side of this seasons run. It will sell off very quickly so plan an exit strategy once you’ve secured some earnings. 

Good luck",2019-10-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dd92ov/3rd_alert_on_shippers/

NEW YORK, Oct. 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Digital Asset Monetary Network, Inc.**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XmDesl7LgD1_2acVCKoPwWifypjH7_pHj90TT3l27oipfd_ZiZ-eczotzS1JCrgd0We7nlw8HiepdORDkfqD5X_uc2Hz2V5bJ6ruzlbt6FtVOFqaIJ5JvkS768fJXOvD) or “DigitalAMN” ([**OTCMKTS: DATI**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qIWwOw99k_zVe4NriXrfwHbChMy0KUhrtJBKBJOGWAMhrJEc8Gj6HyklDQjSeEukdUm5DB0QIiViywIFTck2uUwQ_1WUJaaAE5A-LgizxJVM7WM8LvHQzNtJ0GiPmlAp)), a Public Accelerator-Incubator (“PAI”), announced today, that DigitalAMN has completed an initial investment into Project JAM, Inc. (Justice For All Musicians (“Project JAM” or “JAM”)), the blockchain component, social media platform – focused on bringing fairness and transparency to the music industry.  


[DigitalAMN initially announced the onboarding of Project JAM as a client-company](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XmDesl7LgD1_2acVCKoPwSkMj1tq6JUuRWWqhFx6qzGm3UkbFhnEdBcNRmulfYegd0Fkiw5mfth0baLBY92Gedxprz7GW4yKTWZwk5kgobZznBdLozN6sD0R9_A_VnfUJFf0im0k5Mkn0bUmAYkFI4mNCGrX42eUpmZV_RMAVCzTEs1ZKX5I3XN0XLoIrZYOSDU8IyIPXOMzaum8VVejXiBLCH6EK-FpmFOnh6QpdvUQpEo7WdHN6eY6eE3c6ohI3JarXYAPvgCSMGtCI52wFTC5Qk8ywovn5_qHqnliI2c=) in August. On the heels of DigitalAMN’s signing of Project JAM, [Spotify announced the acquisition of SoundBetter](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lHlBIH6ZYpyIsFDT9LY_aWWE1d7lkdhVTETz0TIoIG3dHSvyKAGs1jvDyTAba554r5QBOIk9Ihy8UmH8yu_qtx4mCwDhKBV8Do3xfHYNhknJWp8fgfdk_rcXNL2124AXCdodWp_VQsfF9OdYQ3tcYLdWTkTXIskfDFUJkc4CQfUNZVWQ7Y-cnZdWkp50c6epsVA7EVw0lD4f7u__aWg9vmaumfpp0JqFJG5-ulq1fUFDxZZMxTlIOAqeWgIEf_Jz), which is the largest competitor to Project JAM.

“After attending a music showcase event September 20th at the Peppermint Club in Los Angeles, where [JAM announced its equity crowdfunding offering](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2HZmHCwnh-CZPVFpqpxsCyXek-jzr2dWS_K8Nb0gW2fFNoAp92jQwlv_BxR1_2BBMfZaCPesqnW_7fpVbTQBMHhRZjdNibagYLO38_4mJ8w6lfXf8fGSdccJQw7m8U85gNfa6umYtEVneQZAqTxdIc0EMhG91bKwagdEuyncBMt2zt6oJ_RGnZCm2AfVXbeIBS1vobXmMjdSpqCG4SkEfdyf5CpyfFdkXYA25pstDUqg2rsFhFnoRLntgxW8zsfs4vxkTg9Q_kW27eglVylWgw==) on TruCrowd’s MusicFy, I can confidently say that I believe Project JAM is one of these companies that just gets people excited and motivated about music,” stated Ajene Watson, CEO of DigitalAMN. “And, given the recent acquisition of SoundBetter by Spotify, I know that by us making this investment into JAM, we are strengthening the future of our overall value proposition.”

DigitalAMN typically assists client-companies in leveraging the JOBS Act \[Titles III and IV\], as part of DigitalAMN’s PAI acceleration model. The [decision to invest in JAM prior to its Reg. CF](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w2EeKhNhUbVgtg4Pgda9em5J_XVhimiONj0NaJf3ruNafoDDpO_bFxv4vGzum_VKVYCPs3JewylVI1mwT6JDZ2CzniKrzwgvMaC5-1P99WflcChCuXVoSn3uSezAuekL10LrUqRc0wh2z7NXYGT62dR8KM8t_AqLyUkqvUcsEXW5dN0UVwD_I6-EOc67ajbFcuPTFZo_zqO099IiSoOYUg==) offering going live, came quickly after Spotify acquired SoundBetter. With this initial investment, DigitalAMN has committed to fund a portion of Project JAM’s capital requirements. It is anticipated however, that JAM will not only meet, but exceed its capital requirements during its equity crowdfunding raise on TruCrowd’s specialized music portal, [MusicFy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lC7JJU4RU89a2-prZIeNuqfRPbdpXFEiD2ixkIBxA1zf2s0ZmhijWLfOPWCLvUJv).

Project JAM’s mission is to bring transparency and justice to the music industry. Project JAM is an ecosystem which caters to musicians, songwriters, producers, audio engineers, industry execs and fans, to address the challenges which have long plagued the music industry. Writers, artists, musicians and other music professionals will have opportunities to formalize the ways in which they are discovered, rated and hired by their peers. 

“Establishing a startup and building that business is never easy, especially in music,” stated co-founders of Project JAM, Inc., Anthony Pisano and Tony Livadas in a joint statement. “We needed money and we needed guidance. Most of all, we needed someone that would show up for us because we represent ‘real lives… real people’, and not simply another number on some house-hold brand accelerator or funding portal. With DigitalAMN, we’ve so far received what every startup initially needs – structure, opportunity and capital. With their assistance and direction, we’ve received the jumpstart we needed and we believe Project JAM and JAM Compass will ultimately be better because of it.”

Watson concluded, “This initial investment into Project JAM brings the count of our music assets to three \[technically\] – having [Vezt, Inc. as an Angels+ portfolio client](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nBBqrSbq2wn2x4k7u5OqgghkS8_EP-bdtqt6X7zEJ5J9hxwVDYlIc_Y93veHH20jPSDx7fOPgz2M1ZhN8BomPjc3chBqOTtpa69Pe6jOfWE2uj0tiEmRo6EOCpXKFfLNv_pjisVqYR1UET0DAMYka60IkYClzwoNHBZ1C4VhXDSu4578bWJ4Li6tfdMIs4Jf79jMzTcTNnkAWvVPtlpDVTOSMdzMJTn0oDZESVo5udnezOyi7cHCFtqZc8oCD2vtz0nYUA1oKGBQud7Cme3LurIi6WCfXT3bHt97VWudnEzu_7hZkUKn5jEVVBvSoF5_), along with MusicFy as an asset through TruCrowd, Inc. What makes the JAM investment so exciting of course, is its similarity to SoundBetter. SoundBetter has roughly 180K+ users and generates millions of dollars in monthly transactions, whereby we believe that Spotify clearly sees the value proposition in being a part of the music industry ecosystem. In our ongoing work with Vezt, we could identify that JAM, with the right backing and guidance, could be a strong competitor to SoundBetter, while being synergistic to [Vezt’s music royalty sharing platform](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2V5CAoj1qiBHohjYn35JU9p3B4J5dcoB4uQ4CuQXfnTlAKnwHlG4oxt2toI8YuwfohG1is30aGY6dSNQ0zwYtIm6ktZz3u5Khq76mxo_yfuVszSW9H1M9ethCZZEBB27). We believe that Project JAM could potentially benefit from Spotify’s acquisition of SoundBetter, considering it supports a more robust social platform with its On-Demand feature.”

Project JAM’s management team also has an impressive reach within the music industry and their network extends far beyond, into other markets such as gaming – where influencers like Faze Blaze of the FaZe Clan are amongst JAM’s founding investors.

9,Most requested advice I've given,ddeyo4,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddeyo4/most_requested_advice_ive_given/,10,1,"I've gotten many PMs, here's my view.

1) Trade with the trend

Ive said this in a previous post, but I can't stress this enough... TRADE WITH NOT AGAINST. Trading reversals is not a great way trade, don't try to catch a falling knife. If a stock is trending down, look for a short position, and if a stock is trending up look for a long position. This step alone increased my win percentage by a lot. They way I trade is only short. First I look for any bad news catalyst in the premarket, and/or stocks that gapped down a large percentage overnight. Then I wait around 10-20 minutes to confirm a downtrend, and enter short during consolidation/pullback. I exit my position when the trend begins to slow or the stock hits another consolidation period.

​

2) Trade the most likely not the biggest

Almost all of my wins were not from the biggest move that the stock had made that day, but from moves that I know are most likely going to make me money. I'm sacrificing some profit to be right more often. When your trading strategy tends to have higher win percentages rather than bigger individual wins I've tended to see that my mind stays clear and I don't make irrational moves without thinking them through. This also means trade only the best setups. If there isn't a proper setup to trade, then don't trade it. If you go red on a setup that you knew wasn't great, you will regret it immediately. Being even is way better than being red.

​

3) Recognize when you are right and when you are wrong

I personally struggled with this for a while, until I consciously thought about selling a position. Ego plays a big part in this and you need to understand that even the best traders are wrong sometimes and the reason they are so great is because they know when they are wrong and can keep their mistakes small. My problem was the opposite, because I feared losing money so much that when my trades went even slightly red I would panic and sell out. But of course, the move would happen right after I sold out and I would have made money on the trade. For a few of these 13 green trades I was red for upwards of 10 minutes but I knew that my entry was just poor, but the move was still going to happen. Use your knowledge to truly figure out if you were correct or wrong.

KELOWNA, British Columbia, Oct. 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Allied Corp.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=t2zbH4jEVmStgLJ0gWzOZgblZlC4czPGGrlle9e7k_WH1LsTqFtMIRGWccVF6RDD_b7R08iQ8jwi7oQnZF4ymg==) (""Allied"") (**OTCQB: ALID**) – an international medical cannabis company focused on creating and providing targeted cannabinoid health solutions to address today’s medical issues – is pleased to announce a follow up to the previously released Letter of Intent of September 11th, 2019 about Asian distribution. Allied has reached a definitive agreement with Hong Kong-based CBD Group Asia Limited (“CBD Asia”). This agreement will leverage CBD Group Asia's capabilities to distribute Allied's CBD-based cosmetics and natural health products into China, Hong Kong and throughout Asia. Allied is extremely pleased with the swift execution and targeted follow up to finalize this definitive distribution agreement.  


Further to this, through our European partner, Allied has also produced and shipped six (6) test products to Hong Kong to be examined and discussed by a retailer-comprised focus group. Allied intends to use the results from this focus group to inform that first large production run intended to happen in Q4 2019.

The structure of the definitive agreement positions Allied to produce and deliver high end CBD products for distribution into Asia as a 50:50 joint venture with CBD Asia. CBD Asia and Allied will be 50:50 owners of this joint venture corporation that will handle all of the distribution logistics.

According to Hong Kong-based investment company Regent Pacific Group, the cannabidiol (CBD) market in China alone is forecasted to be worth USD $15 billion by 2024. The global market specifically for CBD-infused skincare products, meanwhile, is expected to reach USD $1.7 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research.

“With CBD Asia’s well-established distribution channels and stronghold in the market, we believe that the potential for our products in Asia is extremely bright and promising, which is why we're working to establish our market share in this emerging market,” said Calum Hughes, CEO of Allied. “This is a great opportunity for the Allied brands to enter and expand through the Asian CBD market. We are excited to explore the space and potential near-term revenue from this.” Hughes said.

CBD Asia specializes in the importation and customization of premium Canadian consumer packaged goods (“CPGs”) for the Chinese marketplace. A vast network will be utilized to distribute premium Canadian CPGs into China’s largest retail chains and stores, including RT-Mart International Ltd and Carrefour SA. RT-Mart alone operates 484 retail locations covering 233 cities and 29 provinces in China and generated $20 billion in sales in 2018. In addition to this, CBD Asia will be marketing and selling Allied CBD products through e-commerce and we-chat sales channels.

“We see a huge opportunity to brand and market Allied’s products into one of the largest cosmetics markets in the world,” said James Foster, CEO of CBD Group Asia. “We’re very excited to be working together and cannot wait to bring Allied’s products to distribution.”",2019-10-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddbaxo/alid_allied_corp_signs_definitive_distribution/
