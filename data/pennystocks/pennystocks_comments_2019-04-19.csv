Hopefully it continues to rise at a record setting pace and shareholders can make some money on it. I have been burned too many times by stocks just like this, so I plan to stay away from it.

At that point you will be one of the last bulls on a sinking ship in a sea full of sharks. 

You also have to watch out for pumpers, who are invested heavily in a stock. They tend to ignore important news. Or at least pretend to ignore it or even try to flip bad news into positive news. Many would make great motivational speakers or hospice workers!

This is a requirement . Don‚Äôt panic. At the price it is it will be a 10 to 1 . Stock like to get the price to 5$ range when they split. 
Here‚Äôs what I do . Divide the amount of stock you have by 15 . You need to have at least 100 shares . If you don‚Äôt it might be time to sell . Or you can add to it as it goes down from here. As the date of the split gets closer the price will drop some or even a lot. The day before or a couple of days before the price will go back up as volume increases. I buy then I try to get the lowest price I can . On open I will sell those shares into the strength. It‚Äôs usually a 5- 10 percent gain. 
5 to 15 minutes after open the stock will fall . And sometimes it will fall 50 percent or more of the open price. When you see the reversal buy in for the bounce. Even if it‚Äôs a dead cat bounce it will be 5-15 percent. 
  THIS IS RISKY.   I paper traded this strategy several times. If you‚Äôre just holding  this might be the time to sell . Divide you‚Äôre share by 15 and see where you stand. If you don‚Äôt like what you see make a plane.

Following chart trends(i hate following chart to prove a point because its not 100%) it has been on the rise since the 52 week low(low after 2018 earning reported q1) and then smashed people with the link above.

Breaking down into weekly points since the rise theyre at about 17+ cents weekly trading since 4/8 opening 2cents high/lower each day rallying -.6/.12 weekly rise mainly because of shortsellers i can assume.

Here is a copy of a post I put on Quora a few weeks ago.  This is the DD I have at this point. 

Many penny stocks fail because of fraud, incompetent management, manipulation and other inappropriate circumstances. In this post I‚Äôm not going to concentrate on these issues. It is your job to identify these items prior to investment through appropriate due diligence.

In this post I want to address why I believe most penny stocks, which are legitimate companies (i.e. that don‚Äôt have the problems of deception, fraud, etc., noted above) never go anywhere.

In my view, most penny stock companies are what I call ‚Äúone trick pony‚Äôs.‚Äù Sort of like an animal in a circus who can do only one thing. And when that one thing doesn‚Äôt work out, the animal is no longer of any value.

I think about it like this: is the company‚Äôs message something like:

- ‚ÄúIf we can just get that FDA approval‚Ä¶..‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIf we can just get the necessary permitting‚Ä¶‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIf we can just find that one elusive cure to cancer‚Ä¶.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIf we can just master that one earth-shattering technology‚Ä¶‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIf we can just become the dominant player in some niche marijuana space‚Ä¶‚Äù

There‚Äôs always just ‚Äúthat one thing‚Äù which the company needs to accomplish, and then suddenly they‚Äôll be the next Microsoft. However, ‚Äúthat one thing‚Äù tends to drag out forever, never ends up happening, and the company disappears or just founders in penny-land indefinitely.

That‚Äôs 99.9% of penny stocks.

And that‚Äôs why I call them ‚Äúone trick pony‚Äôs.‚Äù When the ‚Äúone thing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt happen, the company is worthless.

How To Find A Penny Stock Worthy Of Investment

I‚Äôve spent years following standard financial analysis techniques when building my portfolio. My view is that such analysis doesn‚Äôt help you identify lucrative penny stocks. When you find a ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù penny stock, it‚Äôs not going to look pretty. If it did, it would already have escaped the land of penny stocks.

To identify a ‚Äúten bagger‚Äù penny stock, you have to focus heavily on (1) the company‚Äôs story and (2) management integrity. You have to identify actual results that haven‚Äôt yet bubbled up to the surface.

When looking only at ‚Äúthe usual suspects‚Äù of securities analysis, these diamonds will slip right through the cracks. Which is the exact reason why a ten-bagger penny stock is so hard to find. The normal methods don‚Äôt work and taking the time to perform the necessary due diligence in other ways is time consuming.

This is also the reason why I can count the number of penny stocks I‚Äôve ever invested in on ONE HAND. The question for this post was 3 Penny Stocks To Invest in Now. I‚Äôd say, if you can find 3 amazing Penny Stocks in your life, you‚Äôve done well. So for answer, I‚Äôm just going to focus on one stock. The only penny stock I‚Äôm watching right now. In my view, you should put this one on your radar and start performing your own due diligence.

Alpine 4 Technologies - OTC Ticker: ALPP

I‚Äôve been watching this company for several years and have begun slowly accumulating a position over the past few months. My decision to pull the trigger is two fold (1) I believe this company is NOT ‚Äúa one trick pony‚Äù as I will explain below and (2) recent results which I believe supports management‚Äôs intended strategy.

When management describes the structure and operations of the company, it‚Äôs frankly a bit confusing. So I‚Äôm going to do my best to simplify things based on my understanding of how the company works.

ALPP is first and foremost a holding company which acquires under-performing assets.

It then puts these assets through an ‚Äúoptimization phase.‚Äù These guys are turn-around specialists, basically.

The first subsidiary to be acquired and go through the optimization phase was Quality Circuit Assembly (QCA). This is a circuit board and wire harness manufacturer located in California. This is also the entity where I‚Äôm seeing management‚Äôs ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù starting to happen.

For example, if you pull up the Company‚Äôs filings and look at the 10Q for Q3 2018 vs 2017 (look at Note 10, for the 9 months ending), you‚Äôll see that the subsidiary QCA reported a 2017 loss for the period of ($100K) and 2018 income for the period of $900K. That‚Äôs a $1M swing into net profitability in 1 year, after completing optimizations in sales, labor, time to market, etc.

(note I‚Äôm using Q3 because as of the time of this article, the Q4 2018 report is not yet filed).

In my view, that‚Äôs proof of concept that management can make their turn-around strategies work.

What‚Äôs more, management has stated that (see this Interview With CEO Kent Wilson) the company is close to company-wide net profitability in Q1 2019 and is expected to turn net profitable in Q2 2019.

‚ÄúBuilt In Diversification‚Äù

In addition to being turn around specialists, the company‚Äôs management operates under what they call the DSF model. Which stands for Drivers, Stabilizers and Facilitators. Frankly, I think that‚Äôs really confusing to anyone who doesn‚Äôt take the time to perform the necessary due diligence. However, it‚Äôs also the very reason why this company is not a ‚Äúone trick pony.‚Äù So let me attempt to clarify.

As of Q1 2019, the company has (based on the way I look at things), 3 primary subsidiaries: QCA, APF and MSM.

MSM is a sheet metal fabricator which provides certain construction services to large warehouse-type facilities. Think Amazon warehouses, large food processing plants, etc. MSM is Alpine 4‚Äôs most recent acquisition as of the date of this writing.

MSM is a stable company with consistent revenues and income over the past 10+ years. For this reason, management calls this one ‚Äúa stabilizer.‚Äù It‚Äôs not glamorous. It‚Äôs not cutting edge. It‚Äôs not marijuana, bitcoin and biotech. But it is ‚Äúboots on the ground,‚Äù real-world manufacturing with a solid customer base and consistent revenue and income. Basically, the purpose of the stabilizer is to provide a consistent revenue and income cycle to provide cash to other entities.

QCA and APF are both manufacturers. QCA as I mentioned does circuit boards and wire harnesses and APF does precision metal work. The company calls these ‚ÄúFacilitators.‚Äù Basically this means the two can work together to gain efficiencies and eliminate competition through what is essentially vertical integration. CEO Kent Wilson does a really good job of explaining that concept in the video I put at the link above, so I‚Äôll defer to that explanation.

What I really want to point out is that once APF, and MSM complete the optimization phase, they are expected to be net profitable, just like QCA noted above. This is what‚Äôs going to create a net profitable company. Personally I think of this as the ‚Äúcompany‚Äôs foundation.‚Äù

Now here is where things really get interesting. Building on that foundation, the company has two ‚Äúdriver‚Äù subsidiaries/products in the making. The first is a subsidiary called ALTIA which deals in connected car technology. The second is SpectrumEBOS, which in the simplest terms is a blockchain enabled Business Operating System envisioned to rival Oracle and SAP in the mid-cap and small-cap space.

The company‚Äôs intention is that these two subs will ‚Äúdrive‚Äù massive profits and revenue going forward. These are growth engines. However, in my view, these are also ‚Äúone trick pony‚Äôs.‚Äù If they work, they work. If they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt.

Now if ALPP was like most other penny stocks, the thought process would be:

- ‚ÄúIf we can just become a dominant player in the connected car space‚Ä¶‚Äù and

- ‚ÄúIf we can just complete this new technology to rival Oracle and SAP‚Ä¶‚Äù

Then the company would be a one trick pony, and I would avoid it like the plague. Because frankly, there‚Äôs no guarantee that any of these ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù will work out.

But this is where I see ‚Äúbuilt in diversification.‚Äù With ALPP, you get more than a ‚Äúone trick pony.‚Äù You get stable, boring, manufacturing companies ‚Äì which have sticky customers and net profitability ‚Äì and layered on top of that are the possibilities of the ‚Äúone trick wonders.‚Äù

It‚Äôs like a penny stock, with a real company underneath.

If the company turns net profitable in Q2 2019, as indicated by management, it will be based on the 3 brick-an-mortar entities QCA, APF and MSM alone.

And just on that, the stock price of $0.03 as of this writing is outrageously low (taking into consideration such a low float).

The potential of the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù companies is just gravy.

If management‚Äôs Q2 projections come to fruition, this company, at a current market cap of $1M, could be basically selling for current year earnings (i.e. PE ratio of 1 or less than 1 - unheard of).

Conclusion

Investing in penny stocks is a highly risky activity. If you are inexperienced with penny stocks or investing in general, you‚Äôd be well advised to stay away, diversify and build a portfolio which is ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù

However if you‚Äôre reading this post, I suspect you‚Äôre experienced enough to understand the risks. So if you‚Äôre interested in what I personally believe is one of the few ‚Äúten baggers‚Äù out there‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not saying to buy. But you should definitely put this one on your radar.",2019-04-19

145,TheMountainThatRidez,elfb9bk,/r/pennystocks/comments/beybfe/rs_coming_for_prpo/elfb9bk/,1,Incorrect. The share holders voted December 2018 to allow the company to do a reverse split with a ratio between 1:2-1:30 giving the company the freedom to do it any time before December 20th 2019. 3 months later they failed their last deadline March 25th 2019 and are subject to delisting. Aka they are delisted so they filed for a hearing. The hearing pauses the delisting and then the pane will rule on the plan that they give them to be in compliance and stay in compliance. They have to do it now to ensure compliance with nasdaq listing requirements,2019-04-19
