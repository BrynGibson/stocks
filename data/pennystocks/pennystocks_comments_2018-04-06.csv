59,84fishforce,dwyabo4,/r/pennystocks/comments/8a9z2w/how_to_buy_penny_stocks/dwyabo4/,1,"Hey bud. You seem like a genuine person and I saw your post this morning but had to run to work before I could try to help you out a bit. I'm actually a complete and total beginner that just started looking into this stuff less than a week ago, but based on your questions I feel qualified enough to at least help steer your mindset in a more proper direction than it's at right now.

To answer this immediate question: Penny stocks aren't typically seen as ""investments"" because they're extremely volatile (prone to drastic movements up and down and generally risky). They aren't like your typical ""blue chip"" stocks (look this up if you don't know what that means, because it sounds like that might be closer to what you're looking for) which you can feel relatively safe investing money in over a longer period of time because they likely won't go under overnight. You can ""set and forget"" these kinds of stocks more than penny stocks. Penny stocks can go up 100% one week (or day) and then down 100% the next. This kind of thing won't happen with Disney or Apple. Of course, the volatility is part of the allure of penny stocks because you can double your money way more quickly than you ever could with a blue chip stock... or you could lose all of it if you make a bad decision out of greed/cockiness/stupidity.

You also asked someone else what they meant by ""paper trading"", and this basically means practicing with fake money until you develop a strategy for a long time before feeling confident enough to ""go live"" and use your real money. Some people don't do this and instead choose to use real money but on a small, SMALL scale to make themselves feel the psychological and emotional aspects that come with standing to gain or lose real money. Generally though you'll be advised to paper trade for at least a year of positive gains, and even then, nothing is ever guaranteed and you will likely still be on the losing side a lot of the time. It's just part of the game. From what I've read, the smartest way to play it is to only invest what you're comfortable with losing completely, and even then, get out once you've made 10-30% back (and ideally you'll be on the winning side 6/10 times, for starters).

You also mentioned that you don't have much time to invest into this, and unfortunately, that's a surefire way to lose all of your money and you might as well be gambling at a casino at that point. This does take a ton of time, a ton of reading, and a ton of practice before you can start making money without it being thanks to luck (and, again, you will likely still lose a lot or most of it at the beginning).

Finally, be extremely careful with listening to people that try to recommend or talk about penny stocks online. Most of them have a hidden agenda and are trying to manipulate you in one way or another (look up ""pump and dump"" for a further explanation). They tell you ""This company is the next Google and is guaranteed to explode 1000% overnight! Become a millionaire and buy today before it's too late!"" so the price gets driven up, and then they sell their shares once you've pumped it up for them (and lost your money in the process). I'm simplifying it, but look into it.

Anyway, this is one of the longest posts I've ever written but I feel as though you might get easily swindled if you're not careful so I felt obligated to try to help you out. I'm gonna go back to researching my ass off as much as possible. Best of luck, friend.",2018-04-06

The odds are overwhelmingly in the favor that the stock will FAIL. Period. Over 95% probability this stock will go to *zero*. 

What is astounding, is that you have fallen into the trap of yet another sucker who thinks the fundamentals of a garbage penny stock are good enough to SKY ROCKET you to riches with your tiny initial sub-penny investment. 

That's ludicrous and it's moronic and it's downright *stupid*. It really does make you a verifiable sucker. You're essentially the same type of person who falls for a boiler room scam. 

&gt;on't make predictions BEFORE you know what company will be merged into the shell and most certainly without doing a single minute of research, for if you did, you'd know that Arcaro has a perfect track record in reverse mergers - all of which fucking fly after being reinstated.

Here's how you make money on penny stocks - you REACT to news and volume and blatant pumps by the company. 

Earnings come out (good or bad doesn't matter) - what happens to the volume and stock price? Volume jumps up? Great - make a trade in and out the same day and walk away with a nice 50% gain. 

Rumors of deals and mergers and contracts come out? REACT to what happens to the stock - make a nice 30% to 50% gain - and get the fuck out. 

Company CEO releases yet another press release with ""GREAT NEWS!"" which is all baseless forward-thinking statements? Does that cause the stock to spike (as it is a blatant pump)? Great - take the meat of the move and get out. 

In other words - THE FUNDAMENTALS DON'T MATTER. 

But because you're a sucker you actually BELIEVE this horeshit. 

Worse yet - you're bagholding all the rumors and pumps. 

So when the rumors inven end up not panning out - you're fucked. You're just another starry-eyed bag-holder that got suckered into another trash penny stock - you're a statistic. 

When the FDA doesn't approve that thing...when the rumor doesn't pan out...when that deal turned out to be a pump...when that contract falls through. 

You're fucked, you're fucked, **YOU'RE FUCKED!**

You are not different. You are just like every other sucker who loses all their money on these garbage stocks. 

Because you're making all of the token wrong decisions. 

&gt;So without knowing jack shit about the company, you're predicting that it can't hit 5 cents? 10 cents? Even more? Go ahead. Predict what you will and I'll do the same. My money's staying put... for now.

WHO THE FUCK CARES!?

I don't give a flying fuck if it hits $100. I DON'T predict I **react**.

Which is what you should be doing. But you're not - you're bagholding and you think you're the .0001% of people who isn't going to be fucked by it.

&gt;I'm going with what the judge who signed off on it said: that it's a very real and attractive package. Judges don't generally sing praise. Something worthy appears to be forming here.

That doesn't actually **mean* *ANYTHING*. 

You're just falling into trap after trap after trap. 

I guess I'm just kind of astounded that you don't see it. That you jumped into this world without doing any research on the stupid mistakes everybody else makes. 

Either that or you read about all the stupid mistakes everybody else notoriously makes with penny stocks (believing fundamentals, buying on pumped news, bagholding ""to the moon!"" and more) and you decided to do it anyway. ",2018-04-06

See you at 3 cents. Then I'll check back in again at 5. If you want me to stop after that, I might. But if it goes to 10, I'll have to remind you of this conversation one more time.

&gt;I don't give a flying fuck if it hits $100. I DON'T predict I **react**.

&gt;I  money from your silly decisions and short you on the way down.

First of all, you obviously CARE quite a bit about saving me from a ""mistake"". Look at at that wall of text, dude! I'm very flattered that your concern for my money runs so very deep and is personal to you. So personal, in fact, that you were willing to put *that* much effort into telling me I'm wrong. Impressive, but reeks of regret. 

You don't care if it hits $100? Fucking idiot. Yeah you do. If it hit $100, even just $1, you'd have been so very wrong in your criticism of my investment that you'd never show your face around me again (figure of speech, you're really just a bitter Internet stranger that missed out on 100% gains when I alerted this). Meanwhile, if it hit $1 I'd be balling so hard I'd have to wonder which luxury SUV to buy for my wife.

You short penny stocks? Sure, buddy. Sure. ",2018-04-06

So you said you take 50 percent gains and exit, right? Great. Normally that's what I do. I got POTN at 60, sold at 90, exited perfectly because it sank down to 30s after that. 

But had we both been in LRDR together at 001, and you exited at 0015, I guarantee you'd be the one barking about how it's a garbage play, it's a scam, all pennies are scams, we're all stupid for holding --- you'd be that idiot trying to bash everyone else's investment for one of either two reasons, possible both: (a) jealous ass haters gonna hate, and/or (b) you're looking for re-entry at a lower ask, hoping someone whacks the bid. 

I know your type. I see you fucks all the time and it's really clear what your angle is. ",2018-04-06
