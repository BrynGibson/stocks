1,"Lazy Wednesday watchlist DPW, CELZ, HMNY",8eqgjr,dirtywiggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8eqgjr/lazy_wednesday_watchlist_dpw_celz_hmny/,3,4,"DPW has to easily be the best. If you can buy before hours I would and watch how it plays in the morning. Bounced today for the first time in a week and is presenting Wednesday at a conference. It did a littler today and caused the spike. It could be an all day play but hard to say now. Slow mover intraday. 100% overnight for Wednesday though. Conferences are the new earnings winners and these things are safe plays at conferences especially overnight. Earning winners are garbage now. 

CELZ is the one people think I have a hard on for and I do. So volatile and nothing like it now. Only touch it on dips with limits. Usually a safe overnight if you are fast in the morning. Been alerting this with profits for a while now.

HMNY got a huge upgrade to its projected price. It will likely fly tomorrow as this type of news has spiked other stocks. 

CELZ is always risk category A. DPW is the safest overnight tonight and tomorrow. Slow within day but might change. HMNY is grade B risky. ",2018-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8eqgjr/lazy_wednesday_watchlist_dpw_celz_hmny/

Last week I saw on tv that espn announced they were going to start showing Esports like MLG and Fort nite or whatever 

I did some research and found GMBL. It’s some sort of Esports entertainment group

I really wanted to buy but didn’t have enough non marginable available at the time

Well a couple days ago I go to check out GMBL and it was up 192%

Went from .20 to over .50

You’ve gotta be kidding me... 

It’s still climbing

10,PHI GLOBAL $PHIL 62.10% Gain today,8ewpcw,adrenacrome,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ewpcw/phi_global_phil_6210_gain_today/,0,0,"11:40 am ET April 25, 2018 (Globe Newswire) 
PHI Group, Inc., (www.phiglobal.com) (OTCQB:PHIL), a company focused on mergers and acquisitions and investments in natural resources, energy, agriculture and special situations, announced today that American Pacific Resources, Inc. (www.aprgold.com), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, will be spun off into its own separate publicly traded entity. American Pacific Resources plans an IPO and is expected to list on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.

PHI Group's Board of Directors has passed a resolution to declare a twenty percent (20%) special stock dividend from its holdings of Common Stock in American Pacific Resources, Inc. to shareholders of Common Stock of the Company as follows: (a) Declaration date: April 23, 2018; (b) Record date: May 31, 2018; (c) Payment date: October 31, 2018; (d) Dividend ratio: All eligible shareholders of Common Stock of the Company as of the Record date shall be entitled to receive two (2) shares of Common Stock of American Pacific Resources, Inc. for every ten (10) shares of Common Stock of PHI Group, Inc. held by such shareholders as of the referenced Record date.

The Company will also file a separate registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 5,673,327 shares of Common Stock of PHI Group, Inc. that have been reserved as special stock dividends for shareholders of record as of July 31, 2012.

With APR's strong forward revenue streams to substantiate the value of the blockchain token, Gildex is expected to be one of the most successful tokens. The Company believes the spinoff will greatly benefit PHI Group and our shareholders due to the special dividend they will receive.

Henry Fahman, Chairman and CEO of PHI Group, Inc. stated: ""This is a monumental event for PHI Group's shareholders. In the past, our shareholders benefited when we spun off ATC Technology, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, into a separate publicly traded company, which has now become Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. (http://www.cellbiomedgroup.com/) and is trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Now with this new deal completed, we plan to form a cryptocurrency incubator and repeat the process to continue creating additional value for our shareholders.""

On another note, the Company will update our shareholders regarding the launch of the Gildex token and other special projects in the coming weeks.
