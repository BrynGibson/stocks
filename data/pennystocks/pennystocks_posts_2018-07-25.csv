Bonfiglio to GT Biopharma's Board of Directors. This stock has been on fire this month. I'm interested to see what they announce next and when they will reveal who this ""Major Pharmaceutical Company"" is.  Remember, they put out press of an ""Agreement with a Major Pharmaceutical Company to Study its Drug Candidate OXS-1550 in Combination With a Multi-Billion Dollar Oncology Drug"" on the 19th so there could be some additional catalysts to look forward to (news link: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gt-biopharma-inc-announces-agreement-120000173.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gt-biopharma-inc-announces-agreement-120000173.html)). 

We also have a very interesting level of where the chart shows previous support and current resistance.  I think if that can be broken, then GTBP could be pressing on a new trend that it hasn't seen in months.
