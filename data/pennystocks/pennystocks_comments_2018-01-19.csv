Make sure you have a plan going into a trade and stick with that plan. Make sure you have a good risk/reward ratio for every trade. For just starting out take small positions and don't really focus on your P&amp;L and don't have a daily $ goal just go with the chart. STUDY THE HELL OUT OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS,2018-01-19
