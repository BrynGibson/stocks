The initiative is great; I mean, to pull gold out of arsenic laden tailings (that inevitably find their way to water) and turn a profit at the same time seems like a win win (bio-leaching). Their bugs eat rocks, and what's better than free labor. That being said, the price on the market has humped up and down around .01-0.1 for the better part of a decade. They own the IP, they apparently have a large group of investors ready to come in to finance a few projects in South America, but nobody seems to care. Which is why I bought a few thousand shares on my shart salary. Hoping I can flip a penny.....or five...... (again, Long time reader, first time dreamer). Nothing to move the market, nothing to convince you sharks what to do, but I'd like to know I'm on the right path somehow (morally, at least). At the end of the day it's a company coming in to A.) clean up toxic mine waste, and B.) hopefully pull a massive profit.

They succeed because the other 90% give up, before they see any success.

You will never reach ""the end"" in trading and you will never know everything in trading, you will always keep learning and improve your trading everyday. This is very important to acknowledge, that the process is the important part and not the end goal you might have. That doesn't mean you can't make a living in this process from trading.

&amp;#x200B;

But why is it just so hard?

The truth is: Trading is 20% strategy, 20% money management and 60% emotions.

Finding a strategy is easy, there are millions out there, that gives you an edge in the market. But sticking to your strategy and your rules is the very hard part.

The market wants you to be greedy and fearful. Of those emotions take over, sticking to your rules is the very hard part.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are currently struggling with your trading, please DM me and I'm very happy to invite you to a (free) community of traders, all improving their trading everyday. Doens't matter if you are daytrading, swingtrading, trading options, FX, pennystocks etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking forward to help your trading. (dear admins, this is not a promo for a paid service/group etc. I do not include any links in this post. I just want to discuss with people who do not found success yet in the DMs, please don't remove, thank you)",2019-02-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/apz6b5/if_you_are_currently_struggling_with_being/

Hi team,
One of the guidelines on /r/stocks is not to hesitate to tell us about a ticker we should know about!  So here it is.

Following up on the previous post submitted 6 months ago - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/95mnqm/mission_ready_solutions_mrs_a_monster_in_the/

After a 6 month halt and reverse takeover, MRS has completed the acquisition of Unifire Inc, one of the 6 companies who are able to bid on the for the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) Special Operational Equipment (“SOE”) Tailored Logistics Services (“TLS”) contract renewals which total up to $33 billion in 10 years. MRS has submitted it's tender to the Department of Homeland Defense and apparently, they'll know in March 2019 how much of this pot they would receive. Historically, the majority of the contracts have gone to Atlantic Diving Supply but in the recent years, ADS has fallen out of favour with the DOD due to their fraud allegations.

**More news on the acquisition below**

http://www.mrscorp.com/mission-ready-announces-escrowed-close-of-unifire-acquisition-provides-corporate-update/

MRS has a strong board of directors which is one of the reasons why they might/could get a fair chunk of the contracts on a given year. One of their board members is Bill Bratton, America's Chief of Police and Spider Marks, a decorated military general.

It's not always a quick flip sometimes I can pull profit in hours, sometimes it takes just under a week. 

Just wanted to put it on people's radar. They are trying to get into the Cannabis beverage business.

Good luck and happy trading!

AGRX started to run after “endpoint met in drug trial”. The biggest BioTech Penny Stocks catalysts are trial results. Some of them, may cause stock price to almost triple, most will run below 50% as it was in our case. This creates opportunities to play the stock on the way up and on the way down after peak is reached. This had two peaks so you could short it twice. In general you could play it 4 times
