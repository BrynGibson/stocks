6,SCON - A calm before the storm,g1jdm7,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g1jdm7/scon_a_calm_before_the_storm/,121,93,"[SCON Chart -](https://ibb.co/SNPcW2P)  a Superconductor Technologies Inc engaged in developing superconducting solutions. In short, wire or wires that perform proactively using 100 times the current capacity as opposed to conventional ones with zero resistance. I for one personally see a major interest in this description alone for a plethora of reasons. Primarily, power outage resistance, short-circuiting, better performance, and of course, better conductivity. What's not to like here? With the upcoming warm days, I can assure you many of us, including myself, are energy hogs when it comes to electricity. 

What intrigued my personal interest with this particular stock is not only the price but also reviewing the previous news going about the merger is in motion though it's not specified when. [The source can be found here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/superconductor-technologies-allied-integral-united-113010438.html) Personally, this would set an unknown price target that may lead to a super explosion breakout depending on this team-up merger these folks are forming with Allied Integral United, Inc. AKA “Clearday”. Clearday appears to be legitimate despite being a privately owned business since I was able to locate both their Address &amp; contact business information. This assures me this isn't some back ally shady corner that would pop up on say things such as google maps.

Getting down to business... I see no downward trend in this chart; meaning it remained support bound at 0.13 &amp; HODL position attractively. Between the 50day &amp; 100day lines intrigue me because it's pointing towards a tighter band, and even more intriguing the trend line is at the edge meaning something is due for the unexpected.

Pros:

EPS steadily improved from Q4-2018 and moved upward firmly Q3-2019 to Q4-2019

Medium float that hasn't fallen below 15mil

PE -0.10 which is pretty fair

PB 2.19 (reasonable for investors)

Oversold to the max

Cons:

Net income low (obviously overly shorted but subject to change).

EPS Rank -1.82

Debunking myths and rumors:

1) Based on reviewing previous news from their past, I don't see a reason why would they submit anymore offering considering the value of the stock is already at its lowest. I also believe it wouldn't make sense to even think otherwise they would if said merger would be concluded unless observing it thereafter at least one week after the said merge. 

2) The most recent concerns that are going around are delisting rumors. Let's go ahead and end this properly so that intrigued investors and holders can move forward calmly and positively. The most recent actual concrete in stone writing anything related to delisting was back in Dec 9th. SCON was in fact was supposed to be delisted prior to Jan 6th, 2020, but it hasn't. Here's why, because they have not exceeded their 180d period to meet SEC expectations to target or exceed $1. So in short... The company said it will monitor its closing bid price and may, if appropriate, consider using available options to regain listing compliance. However! In short ""Under the listing rule, the Company has 45 calendar days, or until January 16, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders' Equity Requirement"" already dismisses the delisting in general since... a plan is already underway.

&amp;#x200B;

Other questions most likely folks are going to ask me are:

1) What's a good entry? 0.17-0.18

2) What do you think is the price target? 0.56. Although after the merger personally it's unknown to me since I don't have enough information about Clearday.

3) If I bought now, what's a safe exit if things were to go south? Minium, 0.16. I do not recommend stop loss. 

4) What's the HODL line currently for day traders? 0.18

5) What confirmation level do you see if it is likely to do a continuation? If it breaks at least 0.24, maintains price strength/volume. Avoid paying attention to premarket except 8 am to 9:45 am.",2020-04-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g1jdm7/scon_a_calm_before_the_storm/

Yesterday Haywood and leedes were the number one buyers on this unusual volume day. They are not your average retail traders like TD, RBC etc. They are big guys. Haywood bought a total of 250k shares and leedes 228k shares. Again this volume is unusual so my guess is people are positioning themselves for what is to come. 

It’s early this morning but there are some nice bids. I’m referring tot he Canadian markets of course. Here’s my post from yesterday. Some good info in there. 


$gldn (gold play)

Check out Golden Resources they are sub .05 cent gold and copper explorer. With gold continuing to skyrocket and the pandemic not looking like it will end soon, money is going to flow into mining plays. 

A lot of gold and silver juniors are moving. $gldn has a stellar gold property in Newfoundland near some profiling gold discoveries. They also have a copper property in the golden triangle which they already hit amazing copper numbers and it ran the stock into the .50s. 

I called $uex last week at .12 with the uranium run with a post on here and it ran to .165 this morning. Look into $gldn. It’s a great way to take advantage of the moving gold prices and it’s trading at 4 cents right now. Mike Blady is the ceo and I talked to him before he is super informative and will answer any questions you have I’m sure as he did with me. 

Good luck to all",2020-04-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g1qdj3/gldn_more_info/

30,NDRA - A Quality Post,g21ibw,justasbadasyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g21ibw/ndra_a_quality_post/,8,6,"Description:

Endra Life Sciences (NDRA) is a medical device company that is developing a medical device that allows clinicians to monitor tissue composition/function and temperature on individuals at risk for developing Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), and help determine disease stage. This technology is called Thermo-Acoustic Enhanced UltraSound (TAUES). TAUES would be much cheaper than the standard of care (MRI or CT scans) and would be less risky/painful than a Surgical Liver Biopsy. Endra’s CEO, Francois Michelon, wants Endra Life Sciences to be viewed as a “software company, with multiple software applications.” One implication is that Endra could potentially expand in different markets in the healthcare industry.

Potential 2019-2020 Catalyst

-Potential sales for device
-potential FDA approval with 510(k) clearance
-Adding IP assets (currently at 70), TAUES launch in the EU, and the US.

Financials (as of Sept. 30th, 2019)

-Cash Position: $2.3M, Quarterly Cash burn: $533K (average of Q1-3, 2019)
-Cash Runway: Most likely into 2nd Half of 2020
-No Income

Take On Finances:

Endra manages its cash well. Concerning raising capital, management has expressed a distaste for dilution several times in the past.

Bull Thesis:

Endra has the potential to compete in an expanding market exceeding $1B+. Endra has a partnership with GE Healthcare, the ultrasound market leader, with a 30% market share. The relationship provides multiple advantages, including product development support and access to existing GE customers.
 
In the past, Endra has had problems with overpromising and setting unachievable deadlines to their investors. Additionally, the company had clinical setbacks with finding test subjects.

Bear Thesis:

Although Endra is a promising company, they have a few competitors and obstacles to move through before they can provide this elaborate device to the public. If Endra does not receive an FDA approval and receive a 510 (k) clearance, the outcome will be devastating to the stock price since they need these certifications to sell their device in the US.

Endra is a high-risk investment, but I believe at the closing price on 04/15/2019 of 87 cents, Endra is a strong buy for either a long-term hold or a swing-trade. The upcoming catalysts referenced above are important factors that should impact the stock price significantly. We could also potentially see more insider buys and, financial assistance from GE Healthcare, or collaborations/ partnerships with other NAFLD/NASH companies.",2020-04-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g21ibw/ndra_a_quality_post/

I called GHSI last week, and was hoping it would go to a dollar but only went up to 0.60. Still made $1500 profit  but I wanted more. Oh well onto the next one.

1. I like DSS because it's cheap right now, and undervalued. Zacks Picks puts the value at 0.58 a share, and it's slowly climbing there. Used to close red, and now is closing higher and higher everyday. I truly believe it will reach the .58 or atleast close.

2. The chart is really fucking good.  https://imgur.com/a/yxY1pus
and projecting it to be between 32-35 based on its historical performance.

3. the more I watch the price action the more I love this stock. It's just building higher and higher support, and spiked up to .30 quite often in the past on no news. Slow climb, but it looks safe to me for now

$gldn (more info)

Hi all. Just wanted to update my post from yesterday. I’ll copy it below in case anyone missed it. 

Yesterday Haywood and leedes were the number one buyers on this unusual volume day. They are not your average retail traders like TD, RBC etc. They are big guys. Haywood bought a total of 250k shares and leedes 228k shares. Again this volume is unusual so my guess is people are positioning themselves for what is to come. 

It’s early this morning but there are some nice bids. I’m referring tot he Canadian markets of course. Here’s my post from yesterday. Some good info in there. 


$gldn (gold play)

Check out Golden Resources they are sub .05 cent gold and copper explorer. With gold continuing to skyrocket and the pandemic not looking like it will end soon, money is going to flow into mining plays. 

A lot of gold and silver juniors are moving. $gldn has a stellar gold property in Newfoundland near some profiling gold discoveries. They also have a copper property in the golden triangle which they already hit amazing copper numbers and it ran the stock into the .50s. 

I called $uex last week at .12 with the uranium run with a post on here and it ran to .165 this morning. Look into $gldn. It’s a great way to take advantage of the moving gold prices and it’s trading at 4 cents right now. Mike Blady is the ceo and I talked to him before he is super informative and will answer any questions you have I’m sure as he did with me. 

Good luck to all",2020-04-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g1tfjp/gldn/
