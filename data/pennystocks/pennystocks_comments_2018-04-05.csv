Biotechs you really have to do some DD on what they are working on and you have to be willing to lose your money. As is pointed out most drugs never get approved. Development is very expensive most don't make it, not uncommon for a company to blow $500mill and never get the product to market. This is why new drugs can cost $10k / dose sometimes.

92,Saints420Fan,dx7c4eu,/r/pennystocks/comments/89x4sm/wsml/dx7c4eu/,1,I actually have not paid attention to this since I made this comment probably lol. In the OTC sometimes there’s so many new flavors that catch my eye that there turns into some long lost I have to keep an eye on. Did this take an ugly turn?,2018-04-05
93,zepherb,dx7kqbl,/r/pennystocks/comments/89x4sm/wsml/dx7kqbl/,1,yeah. I don't think its going back up either. you?,2018-04-05
94,Saints420Fan,dx7qqg1,/r/pennystocks/comments/89x4sm/wsml/dx7qqg1/,1,"I honestly don’t have a clue. So many stocks in the OTC are pump and dumps and what not. A long term hold is a rarity. 

I’m very very HIGH on a current play I’m on GLFH 
It’s somehow a long term hold. I post on iHub with people there. I’ve never actually pumped this stock up to anyone honestly cause I legitimately like to buy more when I get money since it’s still relatively unknown lmao 

Check it out some time. Just a summary;

-SEC filer - 10k audited from outside agency (always a +) 
-recently removed all convertible debt (shows commitment to shareholders)
- recently acquired a positive revenue streaming company 
- *posted projection for 0.04 EPS and 8 mil revenue at end of year (makes valuation of company by end of year possibly around 0.80 if they hit their mark) 
- CEO actually answers people - I spoke to him once on the phone and he encouraged me to call back any time, but I’m secretly afraid to cause I don’t want to sound like an airhead lol

It’s a relatively new company that to me has made some attempts to get some traction over the years and hasn’t quite been successful, but for a new CEO mid/late last year and now they are really starting to generate some good momentum. 

10k filing for 2017 and 8ks from this year (they bought the new company in 18’ so it’s not in the 2017 10k sadly) are online. Give them a read. Share structure is great too.  Pretty quiet company and don’t post fluff piece PRs so this is the peace before the storm when they release the 10Q from their first quarter with their newly acquired business they bought in January. 10Q is due mid May so I’m loading up.

Oh and the chart looks pretttttty solid too. The only blip on the chart was when the momentum got out of hand and ASCM came in and walked it down as he/she does all penny stocks.  But that told me ASCM was loading up for the tickers next leg up. 

Oh and 1 huge thing in the 10k that some people skim over. Galenfeha (GLFH) bought their new business for 1$ and instead sold them shares. Sooooo if the company wants to make this purchase worth it - they will have to do some good work :)

Insiders in the company have 2 series of shares locked up: some at 0.45 and others at 3.50!!!! Sooooo they can’t even sell until we make money lol.

Chart has been pretty steady as a rock for 3 months + (coincided with when the new CEO took over) 

It’s just screaming “winner” to me. Read the filings for yourself though if you wanna jump in. I told myself I wouldn’t come on Reddit and blah about this but since this is hidden in another post I feel better about it I guess lol ",2018-04-05
