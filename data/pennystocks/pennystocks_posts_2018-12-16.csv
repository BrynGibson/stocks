0,Weekly micro cap stocks recap $NFEC $CGIX $ADIL $ALQA $ASTC,a6rik2,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a6rik2/weekly_micro_cap_stocks_recap_nfec_cgix_adil_alqa/,1,1,"Weekly stock recap summery:

&amp;#x200B;

In this type of active market, micro-cap stocks as well follow the general stock market trend.

&amp;#x200B;

Like previous, this week provided with many microcap gainers that have a tendency for quick price spikes following rapid selloff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gappers: $ASTC and $ALQA were stocks that saw same day selloff. Shares traded lower at the day they gapped. Stock have historical price action that favors sellers. Be careful when buying.

&amp;#x200B;

$NFEC finally popped. This stock was fun to watch. Sadly shortable shares at Interactive Brokers dried up fast. If you saw my last week's recap I talked about bubble type charts and that this $NFEC price increase will turn crumbling.

&amp;#x200B;

$CGIX gained in price for two days straight without any news. These type of quick gains follow with slow selloff so stay away if you are interested in buying. Better price should available.

&amp;#x200B;

$ADIL was the previous runner. This stock shooked many short sellers out of their positions by spiking this week +100%. Nevertheless, the stock should feel hard resistance at 4$ dollar level so next week it will start selling off if no ""hot"" news is released.

3,Major cut to cathode production,a6ttks,nickpalichuk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a6ttks/major_cut_to_cathode_production/,1,1,"There’s this company called Nano one on the tsx venture(nno.v) that specializes in battery technology. They hold a number of patents and one in particular has caught the attention of 18 different inquirers throughout the world. Including tier 1 auto manufacturers. Those talks are all under NDAs. The executives have been saying that a deal is coming soon for quite a while now. A good website to read about all of the specific quotes is https://ceo.ca/NNO

If you are interested, their website will tell you exactly what it is they do, and how they are improving the cost of producing cathode material.

The important part, is that 18 NDAs are signed. This company doesn’t have a chance at just 1 licensing or buyout deal, but 18. If they can manage the absolute minimum of 1 licensing deal with a tier 1 auto manufacturer, it might be enough to get their name out there.

I believe the skepticism on this would be that we just don’t know what type of deal is coming. They’re a small company and might get pushed around. Either way, I believe at their current market cap of 85mil CAD, the market is severely undervaluing Nano one.",2018-12-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a6ttks/major_cut_to_cathode_production/
