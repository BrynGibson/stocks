This is going to be bigger than Uber. The only thing restricting them could be insurance to use your vehicle for commercial purposes but that is a very easy solution.",2019-01-05

Their contract is with a native/indigenous group who liberals LOVE. 

So basically no matter who is in power, they will have a friend in politics.

The stock trades just over $1 US, and I can't comprehend how this is considered a penny stock, when the work is already guaranteed for at least a year?",2019-01-05

Trading penny stocks the way you are is completely luck based. The market could go up, it could go down. If it followed any discernable trend, don't you think a lot more people would have a lot more money by now. I can get behind penny stocks for a company that has a solid structure, business plan, etc.. But using technical analysis is like a slot machine with 50/50 odds. Still better than an actual slot machine though lol",2019-01-05
7,MonteInVirginia,ed9xzie,/r/pennystocks/comments/acpiv3/pkgcn/ed9xzie/,1,"I just heard about them so I’m not jumping in quite yet but I use TD Ameritrade. 

Distribution networks are already established for so many products that I’m a little weary about picking a small company. The growing, manufacturing, and various branding and marketing seem like things to get in on the ground floor. Distribution seems like something large companies that distribute alcohol, tobacco, and food already have appropriate connections for LPs to make. Constellation, Molson, Altria, and others already have networks in place. I feel like delivery services will get gobbled up by these fat cats. But I’m still an inexperienced investor so these are just things I’ve gathered in my research. 

I would love for someone more knowledgeable to comment on distribution networks.

Good luck. ",2019-01-05

Use technical analysis to guide your trades. It’s not 50/50 odds because you’re momentum trading, using technical analysis as price targets and stop.

Yes they run sometimes 200+% and yes you can POSSIBLY make some money. What a couple grand? On a lucky bet? You quoted Wolf of Wall Street, noice. You would probably make more money working at McDonald’s full time for a week than you would fucking around with penny stocks in the same time frame.

If Amazon owns a company that delivers this, they're also responsible for the safety and security. 

If they have a company like parcelpal do it, they are no longer responsible for that.

Put that together sir, even if Amazon is parcel pals only customer, that means they are responsible for the biggest company in the world delivering a 6 billion dollar industry.

If parcelpal were to expand, it would literally destroy themselves because the union would likely demand some kind of legislation barring their service.

Now that the year is over, and it's gone to binding arbitration between the union and Corporation, that is no longer a concern.

What that means is they are no longer negotiating, and the judge will come up with the decision. ParcelPal is no longer in the crosshairs of a government union, and are now free to expand.

Never forget outside situations that could have a negative effect on your company. ",2019-01-05
