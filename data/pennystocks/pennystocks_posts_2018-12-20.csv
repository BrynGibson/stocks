PHOENIX, Dec. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uptick Newswire Stock Day Podcast features Premier Biomedical, Inc. (OTCQB: [BIEI](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cuDuW7lqnkCL_-cJGP0BsTuha8huNxZHR2fG12KdcPD1vZM3smNRR41S5QDwjVl7NhfjGo71jXJ5uY3o1D9V0hnwqs3vTniea9WaaFG-Btw=)) (“Company”), a research-based publicly traded company that intends to discover and develop medical treatments for a wide range of diseases, which has expanded into topical hemp oil pain relief products. CEO and President, William Hartman, was welcomed back to Stock Day by Everett Jolly.  


Hartman started off by saying they were excited about the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removes doubts surrounding the legality of hemp products.

“This opens many doors and potential sales to government agencies and the Department of Defense,” explained Hartman. “We have a unit that’s focused on selling to the military and government agencies.”

Hartman also stated that Premier Biomedical signed an agreement with a pharmacy and medical distributor and will start training their sales force early in January. He then turned to recent joint venture talks in Europe. He said Premier Biomedical, Inc. is putting that on the shelf and focusing on North America for the immediate future, with potential foreign partnerships at a later date.

“We see a whole lot more opportunity.” He added, “We are currently in discussions with two very large distributors in North America. One of these distributors specializes in convenience stores and they loved our products.”

He mentioned that the distributor to convenience stores preferred introductory products.  Premier Biomedical proposed six new products, of which three were chosen. Hartman continued, “There will be a press release issued on this agreement very soon. I am excited about these products because they represent a more affordable introduction to our products.”

“We have one of the strongest topical pain relief products on the market, and we chose not to weaken them to bring the price down, but rather to make the products a little smaller. We are keeping these intro products at our Extra Strength level to provide the same effective pain relief.

”Hartman then described the other distributor as focusing on large retail facilities.  He stated that Premier Biomedical will be marketing some of their new products under a new name. He said there would be a press release with the details coming very soon.

Jolly then asked Hartman to sum up 2018 accomplishments and provide an insight into 2019.

“During 2018 we continued to introduce new products, and today we have eight,” Hartman explained. “In 2019 we are going to become self-funding. That is the goal, and we are going to achieve it. We intend to get our products into the big box stores and pharmacies. We are going to become a watchword in the industry.  Our products are available nationwide through our website at [www.painreliefmeds.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W04K43N6JYmyWuwz1Qjzgis3suvL9mo0UvvijLy2_WQW7VMAfG0YDEsTDZbTtOyhfT0gVALFt6w3gKI6C0ZSDvH5Fl05dkKdOE2IUAt2LLw=).”
