0,When to sell?,auv0z4,GatorGuy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/auv0z4/when_to_sell/,2,7,I'm long AVMXY but due to the volatile nature of penny stocks I feel more angst about selling out to capture a profit before the price goes back down. If you guys have confidence in a company performing well over the long haul do you just increase your position when things go south or do you sell out and then try to get back in with a lower cost basis? Thanks for the help.,2019-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/auv0z4/when_to_sell/

&amp;#x200B;

 

February 25, 2019 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / February 25, 2019 / Toronto based CO2 GRO Inc. (''GROW'') (GROW)(otcqb:BLONF)(frankfurt:4021) is pleased to provide further dramatic results from scientific pathogen experiments using CO2 Foliar Spray at two separate U.S. commercial cannabis greenhouses on cannabis sativa plants. These commercial growers financially supported this research.

All experiments were designed and measured consistent with GROW's Pathogen experiments on peppers that were press released December 6, 2018. Results:

E. coli - Another excellent result of a two order of magnitude reduction in E.coli bacterial growth (99%) in the CO2 Foliar Sprayed cannabis plant group versus the control cannabis plant group. All plants were exposed to the E.Coli bacteria. Results are consistent with GROW's pepper results.

Image: [**https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/536823/73a50e72-3b5b-4dc1-8016-bab4482e22b4.png**](https://www.accesswire.com/users/newswire/images/536823/73a50e72-3b5b-4dc1-8016-bab4482e22b4.png)

Powdery Mildew - All plants were covered with a known dried powdery mildew pathogen and grown for a further 21 days. Results were scored visually at these commercial sites. All six plants in the control group developed powdery mildew disease while none of the CO2 Foliar Sprayed cannabis plants developed powdery mildew.

Grower Implications - CO2 Foliar Spray is gaining traction with commercial agreements and more successful plant science and trial data. According to Global Organics, the fastest growing acreage is organic, up 20% to 70M hectares Y-O-Y. CO2 Foliar Spray is proving to have some natural pathogen resistance that may lead to reduced need for chemical fungicides and pesticides and faster adoption by organic growers that cannot use them.

John Archibald, CEO, commented, ''We are delighted with the cannabis E. coli and powdery mildew results. Each trial adds to our collective knowledge. These U.S. cannabis results should have significant positive impact on our commercial endeavors.''

PR Newswire

NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2019

NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- VNUE, Inc., today announced the addition of radio veteran John Madison to its executive team.  Mr. Madison has spent over 25 years working in radio, and has been brought into VNUE as an advisor to assist in the rollout of the Soundstr music recognition technology into that sector.

VNUE CEO Zach Bair said, ""We are excited to have John involved with the company.  We believe that he will contribute greatly as it relates to adoption of Soundstr into the industry, helping to establish VNUE as the market leader in transparency and in the auditing of radio play so that the correct stakeholders are paid, and that music licenses are fair and equitable.""

In addition to several leadership roles in the music industry, including as Executive Vice President with Warner Music Group, Madison has also held high profile positions in radio.  He has worked as Senior Vice President at Pyramid Broadcasting, where he was responsible for several large markets including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Phoenix.  

He also served as Senior Vice President at AMFM, formerly Chancellor Media, which at the time was the nation's largest radio broadcasting company.  Mr. Madison was responsible for station operations in major markets, focusing on increasing leadership, increasing revenue, and developing and executing new music marketing programs.  He also was a member of a corporate team that undertook a broad-based internet strategy intended to leverage the value of the company's leading national station portfolio and proprietary content.

Madison said, ""VNUE has the right idea with Soundstr, and I'm looking forward to helping get this technology into radio.  It will provide transparency across the board, and we hope that by leveraging this technology, we can not only keep radio licensing costs in line, but also, ensure the right songwriters are being compensated.""

At VNUE, Madison will be a direct advisor to CEO Bair and his executive team, helping to implement strategy with major radio station groups.",2019-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/av2uyz/vnue_radio_industry_veteran_john_madison_joins/
