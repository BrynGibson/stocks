I think they have a strong business plan and future. They currently have a unique disinfecting system that's used in hospitals in New York and they are expanding. The CEO gave a candid interview and stated everyone that has used their product is a life-long customer, but it takes 6 months to get approved to provide their product to a hospital. I don't see a short-term gain here, but long-term it could pay off. I don't see their stock dipping below where it currently it is (.027ish), famous last words. Their high was .090 within the past few months, but it looked like a 'pump and dump'.

&gt;To break it down, it appears GCGX got all of its money back it paid for the equipment, plus the tenant improvements and all the money it spent getting the lease. This left the company in a very healthy financial position, which allowed it to divert a significant portion of dollars to increasing the brand, Indulge.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the filings today, the equipment was on the books for $800,000, while the brand it owns is valued at roughly $27 million dollars. This is a no-brainer for any cannabis producing company, as it essentially retained the money it spent for the equipment, which is now in full operation. As such, Indulge oils is what makes the company the income. ***The equipment (owned by the manufacturer entity) is just what processes the oil, which is then sold for profit for the company Indulge oils.***",2020-04-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fwzcig/gcgx_looks_like_people_read_the_quarterly_report/
