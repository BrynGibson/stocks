 **Sonasoft (SSFT) Outlines Goals &amp; Revenue Guidance for 2019**                                         Press Release | 01/10/2019

San Jose, CA, Jan. 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- [Sonasoft](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2Pe2S_2VMatHG8FFc33XUy8mTZIT8Mcb8KwJyxduIxQUhd7Hk_xUWm16aG9R7tlm14fzJe2X0UcaXjRvApSIUg==) Corp. ([OTCQB: SSFT](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l_lO1skoh00_gW5WTNafUFkXbcsm4QhtTOtkWpYuf1o23JasC7ngiPocVA2uxQSPqbJvmOFPFIkACw9-QscZtC4VPXE_eS0Q6ECwUs8g6PA=)),  a leader in innovative eDiscovery and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, is pleased to provide shareholders with its goals and revenue guidance for 2019.  


In 2018, Sonasoft posted a number of significant achievements, which positioned the Company for substantial growth and expansion.  These achievements include:

* Increased revenue significantly compared to the previous year
* Uplisted to the OTCQB Venture Market
* Completed a two-year audit
* Developed Key partnership with Exterro
* Secured Major clients such as the San Jose Sharks and Golden Gate Bridge
* Successfully launched its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform
* Secured first AI customer contract from Fortune 1000 company
* Completed a preferred share rollup that reduced its outstanding share count of common stock by nearly 50 percent

“We had quite an exciting year for 2018,” said Andy Khanna, CEO of Sonasoft. “We are even more enthusiastic to enter 2019 and build on the momentum already achieved.  We have a number of initiatives ready to launch that will add significant value to the Company, so 2019 should be another tremendous year for the company and its shareholders.”

**GOALS FOR 2019:**

**Additional Acquisitions &amp; Mergers**  
The Company intends to acquire at least one more company in 2019, but it may acquire up to three companies if there is a strong value proposition.  The Company has entered negotiations with two complementary companies which would add significant value to the organization.  Sonasoft is looking for perfect fits that will strengthen its intellectual property (IP) and boost immediate bottom-line revenue as well as deliver an overall profit.

**Emphasis on Enterprise Market Accounts**  
The Company is shifting away from the SMB market and moving towards larger enterprise-sized accounts.  This is a natural progression for the business following the 2018 acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies and its strategic partnership with Exterro, the recognized leader in the eDiscovery and legal software market.  Sonasoft’s eDiscovery and email archiving solutions are ready for the enterprise market. The recently announced customer-win of NHL team, the San Jose Sharks, where Sonasoft’s solution displaced a leading enterprise-level competitor clearly demonstrates that Sonasoft can compete and become a key player in this market.

**Expand on the Strategic Partnership with Exterro**  
The Company intends to expand on its strategic partnership with Exterro. The Company will further integrate its SonaVault Archiving and eDiscovery Solution to enhance Exterro’s Orchestrated E-Discovery Suite.  This will make the Company’s own IP solution a high-value proposition that is expected to increase revenue in the enterprise market.

**Expand Its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform &amp; Increase Sales**  
Sonasoft further intends to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) platform to offer new solutions to an array of industry needs.  As announced last year, the Company won a major contract from a Fortune 1000 Tech Company to increase the accuracy of its online technical support search portfolio to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction.  For 2019, the Company also intends to offer AI-based solutions that will predict and then prevent non-performing assets in the financial sector, forecast sales and revenue, calculate the demand for support, and apply other predictive applications to real business challenges.  The Company has already tested these enhanced AI functionalities and is currently engaged with potentially interested enterprise customers to adopt them.

**Increase Revenue**  
Following the acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies, the launch of its AI Solution, and after securing a number of large customers last year, the Company projects significant revenue increases for 2019 compared to 2018. Further, the Company continues to press forward with the sales process for its AI solution, targeting large enterprise customers and has a number of deals progressing well. With all of this considered, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues, however, the potential is enormous. As the year progresses, the Company intends to release its revenue predictions for 2019 year-end.

**Strategic Marketing Initiatives**  
Sonasoft has engaged with a marketing firm to add a stream of fresh and engaging content to position itself as a thought leader in the eDiscovery and Artificial Intelligence (AI) space.  The goal is to increase enterprise-level leads, awareness of the brand and its products, and position itself as a recognized leader in the industry through organic SEO and various other forms of marketing and online advertising.

“This is an exciting time for Sonasoft,” said Andy Khanna, CEO of Sonasoft. “The Company is at a stage where it’s about to really take off.  We completed every single one of the goals that we announced last February 2018. Now, we are making equally ambitious but absolutely attainable goals for 2019.  We are confident that the hard work and strategic initiatives will continue to pay off resulting in strong growth and increased revenue throughout the year.  I am extremely proud of our team members for what they have accomplished, and I have the utmost confidence that this success will continue throughout 2019.”

Additionally, the Company is pleased to announce that Sonasoft’s President, Mike Khanna, has been appointed to its Board of Directors effective immediately.  Mike Khanna will continue in his current position as President and will oversee investor relations (IR) and marketing for the Company.

Further updates regarding the Company and its 2019 initiatives can be expected in the coming weeks.

By Paul Lienert and Christine Chan   


PUBLISHED JAN. 10, 2019   


Global automakers are planning an unprecedented level of spending to develop and procure batteries and electric vehicles over the next five to 10 years, with a significant portion of their budgets targeted at China, according to a Reuters analysis of public data released by those companies.   


Automakers’ plans to spend at least $300 billion on EVs are driven largely by environmental concerns and government policy, and supported by rapid technological advances that have improved battery cost, range and charging time. The accelerated rate of industry spending — much of it led by Germany’s Volkswagen — is greater than the economies of Egypt or Chile.   


EV INVESTMENT FLOWS BY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF AUTOMAKER
