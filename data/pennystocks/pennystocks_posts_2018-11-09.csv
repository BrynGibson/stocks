[https://pennystocks.news/american-premium-water-corp-has-the-strongest-cbd-beverage-out-there-here-is-why/](https://pennystocks.news/american-premium-water-corp-has-the-strongest-cbd-beverage-out-there-here-is-why/)

UTRECHT, Nov. 08, 2018 (PENNYSTOCKS.NEWS) – American Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink: $HIPH) has announced an acquisition of a formula, to infuse CBD into their beverages that contains more mg CBD then any of their competitors out there. This new formula they acquired will give the company a competitive advantage in this sector. The Formula called: Hydro-Nano will infuse energy, CBD and THC-Cannabis at a molecular scale. American Premium Water Corp. or better known to consumers as LALPINA because that’s the label on their bottled waters, will become the ‘’whiskey’’ kind of CBD Drinks compared to others. The company has offered an X amount of restricted shares for this acquisition of the new formula.

## Hydro-Nano Formula

How will the formula work? The water which will be infused with electrolyte energy, cannabidiol, (CBD) and THC which contains in marijuana leaves into the water. CBD infused beverages is the new big thing around the globe. As we saw earlier that Coca-Cola has refused to join this segment of the market but is following every development very closely. This gives companies like American Water Corp. the free space to develop in its CBD beverages sector. The company aims also to have the best product offered on the market. Especially, with this new formula they have proven themselves that they are working on their greatest vision. Normal CBD drinks contains 3mg per 16.9oz bottle but with the new Hydro-Nano formula, American Premium Water Corp. will be offering their CBD drinks that could contain up to 15-50mg per bottle. That is 5 to 12 times much stronger, then their competitors. Not only will this product contain much more CBD, but the absorption rate is also 90% higher then their competitors, which will allow the CBD to kick in much faster into the human system. The CEO of the company Ryan Fishoff stated:  
“This acquisition is a gamechanger for us, as we expect it to propel the Company to new levels in the CBD infused beverage space, create a new category in the THC infused space, while driving shareholder value, through the sale of premium, uncompromised products, which has always been our primary objective,”.

## LALPINA

As like most of the industries, the company’s performance is as good as their strength in marketing. Especially with beverages is marketing, a very important factor for the business which American Water Corp. has an advantage in this sector. LALPINA the label of the bottled waters has over 1 million following on social media such like twitter and Instagram. Now they have acquired the technology to create products that improve the quality more. Thus, the company can aim to be the top seller of CBD drinks in the game without being dependent on other manufacturers and logistics as the CEO said: ‘’This acquisition alone could translate into tens of millions of dollars in annual topline sales. In addition, having the technology will open many different licensing opportunities to the Company, both domestically and internationally. In the coming weeks, the Company will roll out its larger strategy for the space as it provides more updates on ongoing discussions regarding the other transactions,”.

## 60 Billion dollar market 2027

Now with the legalization of the cannabis in Canada and the United States that are following along with the legalization especially when the democrats won the senate and Jeff Sessions has been fired. Now three more additional states voted to legalize cannabis including: Michigan, Missouri, and Utah. The cannabis sector has a bright future to look forward to, which also means that much more money will be invested in this particular industry. The amount of money that will be flowing in this sector is estimated to be upwards of $60,000,000,000 dollars by 2027!

2,- $NPHI - ‘The Life-Extending Lottery Market’,9vfn14,PennystocksN,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vfn14/nphi_the_lifeextending_lottery_market/,1,2," 

UTRECHT, Nov. 08, 2018 (**PENNYSTOCKS.NEWS**) – *D.J. Behouden* — The powerful and magical world of pharmaceutical products. The pills that take away our coughs and colds and many, many more. It’s a tough market for any entrepeneur and it seems that without **branded, generic pharmaceutical products** none stand a chance. Luckily for investors, brave newcomers pop up all the time and investors are always on the look-out for new products that could **potentially** **cure diseases such as Parkinson, Huntington, Alzheimer**. Investing in products ment to help humanity feels noble, right? In any case, it can’t hurt to take a dive in the **‘Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment Market’.** 

First of, what is a neurodegenerative disease? **A neurodegenerative disease is a group of diseases or conditions that affect neurons in human brains.** According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are the common types of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortanutely, The Alzheimer’s Association states that around 5 million US citizens have been living with Alzheimer’s disease, as of 2016. Alzheimer is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. These diseases are considered to be passed down genetically. Scientific study indicates that transfer of dominant genes is responsible for 5% of Alzheimer’s disease. Similar, the Huntington disease shows a dominant pattern of genetic passing. It is important to mention that despite scientific research, the exact cause of these diseases remain unclear.

## ‘The Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment Market’

So, what is going on in this market? **Keyplayers in the ‘Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment Market’ include**: **Neuro-Hitec Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., QR Pharma Inc., Biogen, Pfizer Inc. and a wide variety of others.** Turns out it is a big market where every company is desperately trying to come up with the next best thing and history has shown that eventually, someone will . An analyst at GBI Research, Qaisrah Khalid, said: *‘’There is a large pharmaceutical pipeline for neurodegenerative disorders, consisting of approximately 1,494 products in active development. The majority of pipeline products are novel active pharmaceutical ingredients, with only a small proportion of products being either generics, or repositioned from other indications.’’* With so many different businesses and products in development it is interesting to see how mergers and acquisitions by market players will boost the neurodegenerative disease treatment market growth. For example, **Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. merged with Complement Pharma in June, 2018**. Partnering with the Netherlands-based biotech company to **develop products that** **have the potential to treat a variety of central nervous system disorders.**

Interesting to see is that **the neurodegenerative market is facing multiple patent expiries**. This is opening doors for new players, offering low priced products to enter the market. And as a result causing a loss in revenu for major key players. Expectations are that this little cause-and-effect will slow down the growth of the neurodegenerative market. Globally however, **North America is expected to gain the dominant position in the global market of neurodegenerative disease treatment.** As mentioned before, mergers and acquisitions have the potential to boost the neurodegenerative market growth. **Due to strategic mergers and acquisitions of key players in the market,** Abbvie Inc. a biopharmaceutical company and Voyager Therapeutics a gene therapy developing company, **possibilities are created for the neurodegenerative market to grow**.

Other factors that support the expectation of market growth are the increasing global population and average lifespan. These circumstances give rise to the development of neurological disorders, thus, **increasing the popularity of treatments and therefore contributing to the growth of the neurodegenerative disease treatment market.**This rise in prevalence, strong infrastructure and the focus on research and development of new treatment methods are being anticipated to further enhance the market growth.

Still, it is a complex market and in the current day multiple continents are experiencing different growths. **Asia-pacific is projected to have the fastest growth due to increasing population, modernized healthcare infrastructures and favorable government policies**. Also, the neurodegenerative market can be split in different segments based on indication, treatment type and region. Active in five international regions, the market represents a broad field. **In terms of revenu** **North America is expected to position dominantly on the market**. Well-established health care infrastructure in the region, strong focus on research and development and a growing awareness among the people about available treatment are contributing to the growth of the market.

Pharmaceutical company’s who focus on developing, marketing and distributing branded and innovative pharmaceutical products like Neuro-Hitech Inc. (NHPI) **seem to benefit from the expiring patents**, mainly attributed to their low-cost products and strategically stationed in North America. Pharmaceutical wonderfactories like Neuro-Hitech Inc. sell products for minor inconveniences like pain management, prenatal and cough and cold. Buyers are general practices, pediatrics, family practices, distributors, wholesalers and chain pharmacies.

## A sunny forecast?

According to the previously mentioned business intelligence provider GBI Research, **the neurodegenerative disease treatment market is set to grow from $27,2 billion in 2015, to $45 billion by 2022, with an annual growth of 7,42%.** The company stated that a large part of **this growth is expected to occur between 2018 and 2022**, due to the approval of pipeline products during these years. In the late stage, products are expected to be highly commercially succesful. Despite the fact that many patents are at their expiry date, GBI Research stated that several key market players, such as **Biogen, Sanofi and Novartis are expected to hold strong market shares** throughout this market growth forecast. However, due to patent expiry, **the revenues of high-selling products are vulnerable to substantial decreases.** Baring the consequence to potentially drop the neurodegenerative disease treatment market shares. Any investor who wishes a superhuman society and boldly wants to explore a lottery hoping to find the golden ticket, the neurodegenerative disease treatment market is the place to be.",2018-11-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vfn14/nphi_the_lifeextending_lottery_market/

&amp;#x200B;

Denver, CO, Nov. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Ubiquitech Software Corp. (OTC: UBQU), through its operating subsidiary HempLifeToday.com, is announcing the launch of new advertising campaigns for its CannazALL™ brand of Hemp derived CBD products, and new Wholesale/Ambassador Program first announced on 11.06.2018. The Company expects these new campaigns to significantly boost both retail, and Wholesale Ambassador sales in 2019. The Company’s market testing has shown excellent ROI per advertising dollar spent, and the Company expects to improve ROI as advertising budgets increase for these platforms.  


The new ad campaigns will feature the most popular CannazALL™ product, 250mg Peppermint Tincture, and will be created around the new slogan…CannazALL™ “You’re Only a Few Drops Away!”

This new slogan was created to appeal to the curiosity of the CBD buyer and to allow each potential customer to decide just what this means to them. Examples: You’re only a few drops away; from pain relief, better sleep, anxiety relief, feeling calmer, and more.

In addition to the new slogan, the ads will have another feature that has proven to be very popular, and that is where new customers are encouraged to take “The $19 Relief Challenge.” With the $19 relief challenge, first time customers only, are given the opportunity to try CannazALL™ CBD Tincture at just $19 per bottle, a $10 savings over the regular price of $29. This challenge gives new customers the chance to order as many bottles as they would like at this price, which increases the average order size, and to see if CannazALL™ Tincture is right for them, and to remind them that with CannazALL™... “You’re Only a Few Drops Away!”

CEO James Ballas said, “*It is always important to distinguish our brand from the competition, and we believe that having people identify with a positive mindset is a great addition to that. Because, in addition to our amazing products that we are always improving, we want people to think of something extra special when they come across the CannazALL brand, and our new ad campaigns will really get our products and message out there through 2019.""*

The Company wants shareholders to note that the new ad campaigns will be for both retail sales, through the HempLife Today™ Website, and the new Wholesale Ambassador distributor program announced on 11.06.2018.

COO Luke Dreyer said, *“We have been working diligently on SEO and building out that very important component to our growth, and we expect that to start to come to fruition in first quarter of 2019. But, it is equally important to have strong paid ad campaigns as well, so that we can grow the Company at a faster rate and have more control. There are many new platforms opening up for our industry and we are going to take advantage of all of the most profitable ones as we proceed.”*

The Company has set a goal of at least 3 times ROI for its new ad campaigns and will work to improve this ROI as these campaigns grow. The Company believes that with increased ad buys throughout the year and the residual repeat sales generated per active customer, that the new announced ad campaigns could significantly add to the Company's quarterly and yearly revenues.

CEO James Ballas adds, *“With our new ad campaigns we will be more robust than ever as we move into 2019, and we will be pushing the CannazALL brand hard on multiple platforms. Add to this our Wholesale Ambassador program and all that we are doing to expand that, and are constantly improving SEO, new products we will be adding, and more that we will be announcing, and we expect 2019 to be our true breakout year.”*

The Company will keep shareholders updated on the new CannazALL™ ad campaigns, Wholesale Ambassador distributor program, ad platform expansion, new products, and all other pertinent plans through the coming weeks.",2018-11-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vmbrm/ubqu_hemplife_today_to_launch_new_advertising/
8,KGKG (Kona Gold) 225% sales increase in October,9vlp8p,SysBadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vlp8p/kgkg_kona_gold_225_sales_increase_in_october/,1,29,"In case this isn't on anyone's radar.  Another CBD/hemp beverage play that isn't smoke and mirrors.

Up from .04 to .06 this week, already turning a profit, have the patent on the CBD water HighDrate (highdrateme.com) and while other companies are just posting hype articles (looking at you HIPH), KGKG is sealing key distribution deals.  Their Hemp Energy Drink is already on Amazon and their latest sales release contained this gem that excites me. ""We will continue to see an explosion in growth as the company is working to close deals with several very large distribution partners and grocery chains...""

I will let you complete your own DD but here is the latest release: https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/07/1647050/0/en/Kona-Gold-Solutions-Inc-Announces-225-Increase-in-Revenue-for-the-Month-of-October.html

Lastly I ordered some of the product and their CBD waters taste amazing, and their Sugar Free Kona Gold Energy Drink taste amazing.

Now the  ball is finally rolling and they have started building mancamps and cleared the area and made a road out to where the refinery is going to be so it is definitely going to be built. I live pretty close by about 45 minutes away and I can vouch for that. Right now it’s sittin at about 0.0015-.0020 with flippers everyday. On oct 22nd they inked a deal with Somebody to manage financing. So something to keep an eye on for sure. ",2018-11-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9vlkoc/mmex_thoughts/
