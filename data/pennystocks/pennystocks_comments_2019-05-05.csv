One thing i know that is miles off your topic however is how totally fucked Kraft Heinz is as a company. 

For example, they totally decimated one of the oldest, best loved confectionery brands in the whole fucking world -Cadbury. They make that shit in Poland now -can you believe it!- and mix it up with all their ""straight from the lab"" frankenfoods  to create abominations like Cadbury coated Oreos.

They can file I believe a 10-kn or something similar that gives them 15 days (max) to file without punishment. As far as what happens next, it depends on the stock listing its on. OTC and OTCQB have different rules. I've never dealt with NASDAQ. If NASDAQ delists, I'm sure they have a backup application ready to go, I doubt a company that big can delist with full stop. If its a stop (with OTC) you can still buy.
