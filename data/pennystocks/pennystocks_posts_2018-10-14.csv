Accumulation has been very heavy the last couple of weeks. I personally
loaded nhpi at .0013 friday as I am expecting a much bigger run this fall.
Here are my thoughts on why I think this could run to much higher levels.

NHPI has a current float of only 880 million. This is not high for an OTC
stock. For comparison, there are stocks that have run to multi pennies with
over 1.5billion shares in the float.

FDA speculation. No dilution or debt. Small float. About to go current.

Every year, there are several OTC stocks that run from .0001 to multi
pennies. $ANDI $LDSR are a couple recent ones that went on huge runs and
gave massive gains. I believe $NHPI is the next to make a massive run, and
I bet big on it. Lots of great OTC traders in on this play, check the
cashtag on twitter for reference. This float is getting locked up at this
levels. .01 is a realistic target, especially if this goes current.

This is not investment advice, and you should do your own research as
always. This is currently a speculative play, but thats how all the big
runners have started. The chart is telling a story, this came out of the
trips and is holding these levels. Very rare, and when this happens, there
is usually much more upside.",2018-10-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nzaax/nhpi_undervalued_gem/

3,Don’t buy stocks that don’t report quarterly,9o2xtx,StocksInDepth,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9o2xtx/dont_buy_stocks_that_dont_report_quarterly/,1,0,"             As investors, we all want to find that perfect stock in which we feel will go up. The problem is, a lot of investors end up falling for cheaper stocks on the OTC Markets that don’t even report quarterly! Why is this bad? 

              First off, for a stock not to report quarterly, it usually falls on the Pink Sheets or Gray Sheets. Usually, these are the lower quality and cheaper stocks. A lot of investors go to these two exchanges because of how cheap the stocks are and usually because they feel they can make a lot of money. Well, this usually doesn’t make people money as most people lose their money on the Pinks or Grays. Don’t invest on these two exchanges! 

              Secondly, you WANT a stock to report quarterly do you actually know how the company you may want to invest in is doing. Determining a stocks fundamentals is one of the most important things when investing. If a company doesn’t report quarterly, doesn’t that indicate something... bad? 

             Thirdly, all NASDAQ, AMEX, and NYSE companies must report quarterly. I recommend you stay on these exchanges as you can still find great penny stocks! Also, give the OTC-BB a look as this is an exchange owned by Nasdaq which has much stricter standards than the OTC Markets. 

              Lastly, there are some stocks that report quarterly on the OTC Markets, but I still would recommend staying away from dark or defunct stocks even if they seem “good.” 

               To conclude, be sure to do a lot of research before buying into penny stocks and never buy ones that don’t even report quarterly! If you want more tips, there are many books that can help out. ",2018-10-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9o2xtx/dont_buy_stocks_that_dont_report_quarterly/
