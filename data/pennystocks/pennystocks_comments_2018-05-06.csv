Opening a brokerage account is like opening a checking account.  It can be done online by providing certain personal info.  Sometimes they may request proof of identity which can be achieved by sending in documents via mail or fax or answering certain questions via phone.

Before you choose a brokerage I suggest you figure out what style of investment appeals to you the most.  

Day Traders want returns immediately 

Swing Traders want returns days, weeks, sometimes months later.

Long term Investors want returns years or decades later.  

It's not about how much money you want to invest in stocks as much as it's about how much money you're willing to lose in stocks.  Once you have that amount in mind understand that certain investment strategies or stocks may not work with the amount of money that you're willing to invest.

32,DoccSampson,dyktkd9,/r/pennystocks/comments/8hgkwa/massive_noob_wants_to_invest/dyktkd9/,1,"Ok, noob here as well, so let me give you some very general advice that I should have waited to hear before diving in. 

Penny stocks are volatile and hard to predict. They're not like regular stocks that you are going to watch over a period of time and then jump in when the time is right. The movement in penny stocks lasts maybe a week, then it tanks and it's usually done for a long time. 

There are online forums in which the participants talk about penny stocks that are on the rise. *HGVA .21 up 30% in first day. Load!* However, almost always, this is well after the fact that they've already been rising for some time, and you're likely too late. By that time, you'll buy in and suddenly the value will start to drop back to it's pre-surge prices.

This happens over and over for new penny stock investors and it feels real shitty, man. Inner monologue: ""Wow, this stock has been rising since 9:30 am, and it's up 21.9% for the day! If I had invested 1000$ at the beginning I'd have made 200$ by now. I better jump in now. What are the odds that it's going to start dropping right when I get in?"" To answer your hypothetical question to yourself that I just made up, most likely it's going to start dropping within a few hours, to one day after you buy in, and you're going to lose a bunch of money before you finally give up on that stock and sell what you have to cut your losses.

So clearly you're going to want to do lots and lots of research before you invest in a shaky penny stock. And it seems the criteria for knowing when a penny stock is about to move is a lot different then what you would find with a traditional stock.

Now, take this part with a grain of salt because I am a noob also and just now beginning to understand it: those who do well in trading penny stocks have at minimum Level 2 stock information. They can see when big market movers are preparing to / are loading a particular stock. As far as I can tell, any way to get access level 2 and 3 stock information will require you to buy stock market analysis tools/software.  TDAmeritrade, etc. 

My advice would be to establish an account with a broker, and get some money moved into that account from your bank account. But don't do anything with the money. Just make sure that it's in the chamber ready for you to pull the trigger when you feel really comfortable with investing. Until then, do all the research you can possibly do, especially about level 2 analysis and software that will help you with your due diligence. 

Even then, you should find a stock simulator or simply do your own analog simulation on a white board/pen and paper. Pick a couple stocks you think you've got a bead on and (honestly) choose a price and number of shares at which you will buy in and sell out. See how reliable your instincts and supposed knowledge really are. They make an app called Stock Trainer for your phone that is good for this. Run a minimum of a hundred simulations, which shouldn't be difficult because you won't be ready to dive in for a real for at LEAST 8 months. 

*Disclaimer: I'm fairly new and none of the advice above should be taken at face value. These are my observations over the course of the past year or so. DO YOUR RESEARCH. ",2018-05-06

After about 6 months, when I'd learned a bit about volume, limits, puts, calls, etc, and what to look for in stock research, it started getting frustrating that Robinhood is so limited. I opened an account with Fidelity a couple months ago and am liking that. By no means am I a professional, stilll a total newbie, but I haven't had any big losses yet, everything is green this morning. Robinhood feels like preschool for trading, great place to start. Penny stocks are a lot of fun, but treat it like Vegas- especially while you're learning only invest what you are comfortable losing. If you want to really invest instead of playing the game, from my limited knowledge ETFs seem to be the way to go. I'm using Fidelity for that as well now, but I started with Stash- super simple, free, and walks you through everything. Stash taught me that it's wise to watch and change the 401 investments (401 has always been through Fidelity), and now I'm higher in the green in that account than I ever have been! ",2018-05-06
