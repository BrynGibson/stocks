DECN takes a huge dip every morning and likes to give everyone a heart attack first thing, but it usually bounces right back to where it was within a couple hours.

But then again it also changes patterns a lot. 

Point being, there's a lot of things it could do tomorrow, but personally, I wouldn't start fucking around with it.

It could dip in the morning, and you try to sell your shares and buy the dip. Or it could just go up as more people put in orders overnight to try to get in on the floor before the announcement Thursday, at which point you're fucked and buy in higher.

It's hard to predict what it will do tomorrow, but easy to predict what it will do Thursday.

But it's very basic, and it's charting sucks.

Also, it's crashed multiple times, causing all kinds of financial problems for it's users, and that's just really really really bad.


TDAs interface isn't great, but you also get ThimkOrSwim with your tda account, which is nice.

Tda is very basic, TOS is loaded with bells and whistles.

But, currently, tda has a $6.95 fee for trading OTC stocks. However, they're being bought by Charles Schwab, and Charles Schwab does NOT have an OTC fee, so maybe those fees will go away.

Also note, you can't even get OTC stocks on Robinhood, which is far more limiting than having to pay a fee for trading them.

Some of the indicators I have been using however do point to a potential break out but not likely tomorrow unless there is PR. I don't think its primed for continuation either. I have been looking at the 3 month daily with the HULL and Bollinger Bands and that's what I am seeing. Consolidation not just from its pattern but even the bollinger bands i set are tightening up. Unless PR shows up that's what I am thinking. I'm setting a limit to sell half what I have at .8 premarket and I'll see how the rest goes this week. If there isnt PR that bumps it, I am guessing it will bounce off the upper band I have and consolidate to .475 by the end of the week.

3) people are selling just to buy back in at a lower price

Like I said there wasn't any good reason for the stock to go down 10% today. This stock gets a lot of bashers because it's so popular.

I didn’t do any research about the product lifespan, quality and costs. But I believe they will launch the charger in an appealing manner, so customers will feel attracted to it. This is based on the quality of their website and commercial videos.

Nevertheless, I see this stock jumping above $3 short term. The long term stock price is definitely higher than that.

Thereby, it wouldn’t surprise me if the charger is going to be displayed in Apple stores (aka partnering with Apple) - their previous ‘going-to-be-partner’ ZPower went bankrupt a while ago.

From a risk management standpoint if these tests can lower the chance of a covid person getting on site and shutting down the job site causing numerous OSHA recordables and workers comp claims it’s well worth the investment to be able to screen all incoming employees weekly and on a as needed basis to lower the chances and of course saving the employer tens of thousands in WC and insurance premiums.

You are a troll:

 - You are posting inflammatory and digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages.

 - Trolls aspire to violence, to the level of trouble they can cause in an environment. They want it to kick off. They want to promote antipathetic emotions of disgust and outrage, which morbidly gives them a sense of pleasure.

 - Trolling correlates positively with **sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.

 - Trolls take pleasure from causing pain. Their ability to upset or harm gives them a feeling of power.

Either way, I bought some yesterday and sold it this morning for a nice little flip.

Their kit that can be used by health care professional is currently under review with the FDA.  

In the press release today it mentioned that the “at home kit” is still in the process of being completed for the FDA EUA Application.

From press release on 4/6:

DECN had originally intended to submit its application for both of its Covid-19 Swift Kit products, the Professional version kit to be administered to by nurses, doctors, pharmacists and other professionals, and the at-home personal use kit we envision to be distributed by big box pharmacies, governmental agencies, home health agencies and directly by our own distributors. But because the FDA had yet to approve a kit designed for individual use, we decided to proceed first with the Pro version Swift kit and follow on as soon as possible with a separate EUA application for the at-home kit as a stand-alone application. We plan to use the same application with minor changes to reflect the individual use.
