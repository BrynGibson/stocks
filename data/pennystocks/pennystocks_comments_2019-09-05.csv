Voyager is a crypto asset broker that created and NBBO framework for crypto. Itâ€™s available in 49 US states with 24 coins listed for trading. Itâ€™s commission free, more crypto currency listing coming and international expansion should start before year end. Available on iOS and Android app is on the way. 

Voyager was created by a team with some serious credentials from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The teams Co-Founders bring more than 80 years of experience in financial services and technology at companies like E*Trade, Uber, Lightspeed, Kapitall, Trade.it, and Pager. They are very experienced with start ups. Through a reverse merger, it trades Canadian VYGR, US VYGVF and Frankfurt UCD2. 

Coinbase and RobinHoodâ€™s last money raise valued their companies at around 8 billion each. Now I realize Voyager has a long way to go but the market cap sits around 30 million, .45 cents. Because itâ€™s publicly traded, Voyager gives stock investors a way to get involved with crypto without buying crypto currency like bitcoin, ether etc.

Disclaimer. Iâ€™m invested and this is not investment advice. Iâ€™m in it for the long term. Itâ€™s under followed and the volume is light. I think that will change when it becomes more known. The app launched 7 months ago. Just want to see if this interests other investors.

Will it still be profitable business? This is why biotech aspect intrigued me ,look at Colorado as time progressed price of weed went down. Itâ€™s a rat race to the bottom smart money will invest into the Pharma aspect in my opinion. Iâ€™m talking down the line when there is abundant amount of craft cannabis. Prices will go down in my opinion biotech will survive. FDA pipelines. If somehow fsd can generate profits rather ofcourse it has to be offset and  differentiated from expenses. If FSD can reach that milestone and become profitable sp should go in the other direction canopy had a lot  of expenses due to buildout and other stuff yes they have more capacity at the moment but over time it could go down $

biotech patented pipelines is the real money generator vs $200 a month for an ounce vs 10,000-30000 a year for insurance convered FDA approves applications that is the difference in profit margins. Just my opinion Iâ€™ll be happy with 200,000 sq ft buildout and no more (time and expenses + longer time to become profitable)

have a a nice day! Thanks for listening to my opinion",2019-09-05
