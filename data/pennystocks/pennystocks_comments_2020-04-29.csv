1036,readibes,foy64nt,/r/pennystocks/comments/ga5viz/tti_wait_for_it/foy64nt/,1,"Hi, I'm new to trading and pennystocks, and am curious about some of your reasoning. I don't mean to be negative, and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your DD but I have a couple of questions that I'd be really thankful if someone could take the time to answer. 

Firstly, if NYSE has been generous to them, wouldn't that suggest that they're verging on being delisted? Would that not be a precarious scenario? 

Secondly at a negative PE ratio while refusing to drop below a certain price, how could the stock be oversold? I understand the low PB ratio is attractive, but doesn't that just suggest that traders have a bearish view on it for the future?

Additionally, is ""refuses to drop below a certain support"" a reasonable pro? The past doesn't predict the future so why is a certain support level expected to hold up?

Finally, a debt to asset ratio of 87.2 sounds quite large to me but I don't trade much. Is that really comparable to other companies / pennystocks?

Again, even if I don't entirely understand the DD I think you've done a great thing by sharing your work with the sub. Thank you.",2020-04-29

Yes, you lose potential profit because you didn't keep the whole investment in, but if recoup your investment you'll be playing with the house's money which means it's free money. That's my plan at least. I'm 600 shares averaged at 1.79 because I got in a little late but I'm up $300 and so tomorrow I'll sell off my initial investment and leave what's left to ride the news.

Say you invest $100 into XYZ at $1 so you get 100 shares. It raises to $1.1 so your market value is $110. So now what you can do is sell $100 worth of shares, which if we run the math is about 91 shares, so that you've have now created 9 shares and $9.9 that are essentially ""free"". You took out your initial investment so you're no longer at any risk of losing money, you can only gain money after making this play. If XYZ jumps to $5 you won't make nearly the same amount as if you held all 100 shares, but you'll make a decent chunk of change off the 9 shares that go to $5 so you'll end up at $145 instead of $500.

No one is expecting it to climb back to $30+ dollars but considering its been bouncing around under $1... its a freaking steal.

As for the delisting request. That is specifically for the London exchange I believe and doesn't change much for shareholders in a company of this size. Even if delisted, you technically keep the shares and it can still be traded. 

It also isn't always a bad thing.

Sometimes a request to be delisted by a company (especially one this large) is because a company wants to go private. If this is the case they might buy back shareholder shares at a higher price.

&gt;While companies may be privatized for a multitude of reasons, this event most often occurs when a company is substantially undervalued in the public market

&gt; This situation is typically favorable for shareholders because private bidders customarily offer a premium on the current market values of the shares.

That will put you in a lot of high risk situations that won't pan out for you because, if the pressure of missing out is making your hands shake,  then the pressure of dumping your cash at the peak of a run without knowing it's the peak, will give you an early heart attack.   

You have to acknowledge the reality that there will be more runs,  you won't become rich overnight,  and that this run should teach you some things; 

1.) Which news makes it run
2.) The timing of PR in relation to volume
3.) What to look for in a strong accumulation buy.  

Make yourself less anxious by learning and absorbing info.   Make rational decisions,  and swallow the truth that your calendar is not relevant to anything having to do with stocks. 
Become familiar with a single stock and watch how it trades and start to see the bottoms.   Look for bottoms.   Stop grasping for straws and begin to see where the crucial investment areas are.

IV. Prime Air CONOPS 
A. Overview 
Prime Air will deliver packages using UAS to customers within 30 minutes of placing their 
order. The MK27 is capable of delivering parcels of up to 5 pounds (at maximum planned range) 
to a variety of customer locations and designated drop-off points, which represents 80-85% of 
the products we sell. Operations beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) are supported through a 
combination of foundational elements of a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system (e.g., remote 
identification and automated deconfliction), onboard sense and avoid (SAA) capabilities, 
communications with local air traffic control (ATC) facilities, and careful screening of the flight 
area. This multi-layered approach helps ensure safe separation between our UA and other 
aircraft (both manned and unmanned) and obstacles, and is consistent with fulfilling the 
analogous responsibilities that are embodied in the FAA‚Äôs right-of-way rules for manned 
aviation",2020-04-29

A lot of small gains add up fast! I made around 20-40% from stocks such as: LADR, TWO, NRZ, KOS, ET, and many others.

Of course I have had hits but all very small ($20-30 losses here and there) except for MFA which completely tanked from where I bought in, $2.34, to around $1.25, and that was the first trade I made ever since I started. Definitely learned a lot and I saw it as a good experience to a big loss. The goal is to have more gains than losses; losses are inevitable.

You pay $2.50 x 100 = $250 for that contract now, and if that stock runs up to $170 2 days from now, you can buy 100 shares at $157.50, or if it's at $170, you can sell your contract before it expires to someone interested in buying 100 shares for somewhere around $13.50 x 100 = $1350 if the price of the stock is at $170.  The max you can lose is what you pay for the contract, and potential gains are the limit of how high the stock can go past the strike price of $157.50. what ever strike price you choose, there you are looking at the strike price of $157.50, when you buy a call option, it gives you the right to ""BUY"" 100 shares of the stock at the chosen Strike Price.

They had an interview on facebook 2 days ago
https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=250005033032238&amp;ref=watch_permalink

In the interview the director of Bioreference Labs (testing lab owned by Opko), that they are now accepting antibodies and are doing serology testing. The director also directly said other antibody tests so far has been less then accurate, but Opkos antibody test has 95-100% accuracy. 
Also by second week or so in may they will have capacity to do between 100 000 and 200 000 daily antibody tests. 

They are also as most know the top third lab in the US.

Also big insiders are increasing their holdings of Opko stocks month by month for a while. Just yesterday Goldman sachs increased holdings again, amongst others. Also the CEO keeps buying hundreds of thousands a shares each week, and has been doing this for a long time. 

I believe they will be a major player going forwards, especially with the serology testing. I dont think this stock will be in the single digits by the end of the year to put it mildly. 

Looking away from the covid play, Opko is a good company it seems aswell. On june 8th they are releasing  Phase 3 somatrogon pediatric trial information. If all goes well they are set to receive $275 million upon good news from Pfizer, due to an agreement they have about this drug.

Following the sensational remarks made by US President Donald Trump about the possible use of light therapy against the corona virus, the US government has released details on how to proceed in a US study Trump referred to. In the study, natural sunlight was mimicked as it would be at midday at sea level at 40 degrees north latitude at the beginning of summer, explained scientist Lloyd Hough from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A DHS spokesman added that the study applied samples of artificial saliva containing Sars-CoV-2 viruses to a stainless steel surface. The U.S. government released a summary of the study last week at the White House daily Corona press conference. Accordingly, exposure to ultraviolet light on smooth surfaces is effective against the coronavirus. Trump subsequently raised the question of whether the coronavirus could be treated with light therapy by bringing ultraviolet ""or simply very strong light"" through the skin ""or in some other way"" into the body.",2020-04-29

In penny stocks you want to see big volume compared to average volume. When there's more volume/stock changing hands there's more chance of huge swings between highs and lows. 

Now I've just started reading up on using volume as an indicator so I may be entirely wrong and hopefully someone will step in and correct me, but if you've got a stock thats trending up in value but has below average or low volume it can be a sign that the stock is going to go into a reverse where the value tanks.

You pay 100 x $2.50 = $250 for the right, but not the obligation to buy this stock at $157.50/share (strike price) at some point in the future.  You do not get that $250 back.  It's a fee you pay for that contract.  If your option expires without making money, you lose that $250.  If your option climbs up to a price more than $160/share\*, you will make money by either selling the option or exercising the option to buy the shares at the strike price and then selling them at the new price.

ITM = your strike price is less than the current price.

OTM = your strike price is more than the current price.

Buying options that are OTM is cheaper than buying options that are ITM.  It's cheaper because there's more risk since your stock price has further to travel for you to break even.  If you were to look at the same stock and find a strike price of $155, it will cost you more than $250 because there is less risk.

One might by OTM stocks because there is going to be a big jump in the future and those OTM options cost them less, so they stand to make a bigger profit.",2020-04-29

I initially paid for motley fool but got refunded after my first 20 days in full. I realized it wasn‚Äôt worth paying for.. you find most of their articles for free anyway and the info you‚Äôre actually paying for (the actual stock advisor portion) is hardly worth it. I mean maybe it is but At the time I subscribed multiple of their top 10 stock advisor stock suggestions crashed shortly after I subscribed due to fraud or privacy issues. Doesn‚Äôt mean they should be right all the time but their articles you find for free are actually more sound and stable advice I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs really all I decided I need but could be different for the bigger more long term investors. 

I like what I can find for free with Barron‚Äôs as well. I did the same thing with them..: paid for it, got the special reports, found that what I now paid for in these exclusive reports was old ass news... and got a refund.
