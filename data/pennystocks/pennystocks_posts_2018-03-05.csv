28,LeanLife Health (CSE:LLP).,829zzg,Jaynki,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/829zzg/leanlife_health_csellp/,3,0,"Hello everyone,

First of all, i don't have any knowledge concerning technical analysis and/or penny stocks trading. 

Back in december, i have heard about a micro-cap and i have decided to take a look.

LeanLife Health (formery LeenLife Pharma) is a company that have a top quality omega 3 product.

They have just recently started operations.

They ordered a BioCube (private company) to produce their product and they have an exclusive agreement with them for the next ten years.

January 25th, they made a news release that RD Heritage would market and sell their product. The deal seemed nice and it was stated in their news release that they expected their first purchase order in the next 30 days.

February 1, they made a news release stating that they've rented and renovated ~350 000 sq. feet of industrial space in Vancouver. They've also stated that they had acquired lab and testing material and that the BioCube was close to being delivered.

Their technology seems to be low-cost and if they could have some revenue, i don't think it will be long before they are profitable.

In an MD&amp;A released March 1st, they suggest that they hired two sales representative in Poland and that it resulted into sales agreement to be acted upon. (The CEO seems to have a lot of connection in Poland.). It is also stated that they will lack liquidity for their operations and that they plan to raise via private financing.

When i've saw that news release that RD Heritage, i jumped aboard and invested at an average of 0,36c.

I made a lot of money out of weedstocks and wanted to go hard on a promising (i believe) penny stock. 

I expect and believe they could announce sales contract soon as operation are starting. 

They recently changed their name (mid january, from LeenLife Pharma to LeanLife Health.)

New website will be up soon. 

www.leanlifehealth.com

The graph seems to show support at like 0,10c. They gaved RD Heritage warrant of 0,40c(expiring 2020) and they have granted director stock option at 0,25c(expiring 2020) back in december.

I know that a lot of penny stocks are price-manipulated, fraudulent, etc.. LLP stocks went from daily volume of ~200 000, even up to 1M, from november to february and it is sidelining at ~0,30c since one month.

I am starting to be a bit worried with my investment(i went a bit too hard with such a speculative stock) but i am still confident a sales contract announcement could give a nice bump to share price and i have looked back at everything with a skeptical eyes. RD Heritage website is ugly and i am afraid it is a scam, and a website made with wix.com, seems odd. LeenLife Pharma first website gave me that vibe too but i feel more confident with the name change, the new website and the beginning of operation.

Can some more experimented traders share their opinions or insight about what you see in this company? I plan on holding right now.
