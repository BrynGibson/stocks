""Management Update

Now that significant progress has been made towards the recapitalization, the Company believes that it is appropriate to explore retaining new executive leadership to complete the recapitalization and distribution plan. The current management and board of directors are very supportive of a potential modification in the organizational structure, and have initiated a search to evaluate senior leadership candidates. Further updates will be provided later in the first quarter of 2019.

""I am hopeful that we can identify and retain strong, experienced executive leadership in the near future such that I can take on a lesser day-to-day role with the parent Company, and focus on representing Amarantus' interests at the subsidiary levels, as well as explore new opportunities,"" said Gerald E. Commissiong, President &amp; CEO of Amarantus, and interim-CEO of Elto Pharma, Breakthrough Diagnostics, Cutanogen Corporation and MANF Therapeutics. ""The past 11 years since founding Amarantus have been very exciting. However, especially over the past 3 years, an outsized burden has been placed on my family. I will be most effective serving Amarantus by being transaction-focused, and ultimately leaving the majority of the day-to-day Amarantus operations to a new leader tasked with executing the monetization and capital distribution plan.""",2019-01-11
