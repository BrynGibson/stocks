2,HUGE $STSN News - They just released the companies first video following the reverse merger. Their new CEO grew their last company to 65m in annual sales!,ectg42,Hellcat_v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ectg42/huge_stsn_news_they_just_released_the_companies/,1,2,"I mentioned this last week or so. I noticed on the SEC and FINRA website, they took over the shell WMEG, and changed name with the merger to StemSation ( $STSN ) - They just released a video of their new CEO, the guy who's last company ran to 65 million in annual sales. I think their first PR is coming this week. 

Congrats to those in already. Float is only 1.1million. Should run nicely in couple dollar range in 2020. Check out those filings. :)

13,SDRC - Nice DD on gold miner breaking out right now. .028 300%+ potential,ecy3co,1827338989,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ecy3co/sdrc_nice_dd_on_gold_miner_breaking_out_right_now/,1,0,"Disclaimer - I am long on SDRC since .02 and believe this stock can reach .10 and fast. Here is some DD. I believe this is a rare opportunity in the OTC.

SDRC is a gold miner and has a float of 71M shares. That means the total supply that can be traded is only 71M which is very low for a penny stock. For comparison, SHMP has a 200m share float and ran to .98 from .01 in just a few weeks. NO DEBT. NO DILUTION. which is also, very very rare for a penny stock. Gold put in new 52 week highs recently.

$SDRC. Largest $GOLD Assay sample I have ever seen in the OTC. While digging into their dealings in Republic, WA I found more info on SDRC's activity in Idaho. They are legitimate, very active, and getting stuff done, CONFIRMED.

Let's take a deeper look at their recent activity in Idaho. 1. All mines showing CURRENT and ACTIVE as of 2019 and thru 2020. 2. Land status Checked and Fees JUST paid on 8/29. 3. Map scans uploaded as recent as 9/20/2019.. :) [$SDRC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SDRC&amp;src=cashtag_click) and their mines are very ACTIVE

In detail what the funder said about the Lucky Ben Mine and [$SDRC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SDRC&amp;src=cashtag_click). ""He describes it as one of the most exciting projects he has reviewed and from his vast mining experience he stated it is a project of a life time.""

**This company is looking at acquiring 100+ claims. Drill data has showed up to 1.4oz/ton of dirt, average of about 0.7 which is massive. Only a matter of time, good entry point**

For comparison, MDRPF is another miner trading at .47 with a very similar float. They have .5 **grams** per ton. Sidney has an average from .25 to .50 **ounces** per ton. Do the math. Its a very big difference that financing can make.

During the winter months is the time these companies work on financing. I believe if SDRC gets funding, it could be a historic run and possible go to $1. Do your own DD as always! I think it wil go to .10 on speculation alone! Gold miner OTCs could become a huge bubble with gold hitting new highs! We've seen these bubbles before, and they provide insane gains.
