FORT LAUDERDALE, FL, May 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE ‚Äì DNA Brands Inc. is pleased to announce that the company‚Äôs purchase of its first round of vehicles for its ridesharing fleet have been completely rented out, and are currently working the roadways of South Florida. After recently signing the First Fleet Agreement with Rideshare Rental.com, in the state of Florida, DNA Brands has teamed up with a local statewide car dealer to purchase, accommodate and house its fleet.

DNA Brands has hosted several seminars with numerous interested Uber and Lyft Drivers. As a result, the company now has a waiting list of drivers wanting to rent from its fleet. This comes at an ideal time as UBER had its highly anticipated IPO on Friday May 10, 2019. DNA Brands Management has been able to place all of its first set of vehicles on the road. Revenue is being produced for the company and showing increasing¬†tangible assets on the books.

Objectives 1 and 2 have been met which are the following:

1. Announces the purchase of the first set of cars in the fleet.
2. Announces when the fleet purchased is on the road, and producing revenue.

Before initiating its plans to expand throughout the state of Florida and beyond, DNA brands will continue adding more vehicles to fill the current waiting list. ¬†In that regard, DNA Brands is pleased to announce that it has started a second round of purchasing.

At any given time, when vehicles are available, they can be found at:

‚ÄúWe are building a strong working relationship with a local statewide dealership and DNA Brands is now generating revenue. As I have stated previously, we are following the business model that is working for our Senior Partner¬†[ridesharerental.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNl9f3kNio_FSBXYKaDYpukg-p5Edlv8wXpYHMMnxo4eoIBDHmp8oYrPN1P9fwiCK2A8_hRDIprJw47BNUp0D4-mG75cG7LXN324r93iWZo=)¬†We are looking to duplicate the same model here in Florida. The beautiful aspect of filling the fleet and having it out on the road is twofold. ¬†First there is immediate revenue for DNA. Secondly, there is an incentive for drivers. ¬†Drivers can recruit other drivers and after having been successfully screened (criminal background check etc.) are paid a recurring referral bonus. An added benefit is it keeps drivers in their respective cars. The retention rate as a result is very healthy at over 75%,‚Äù stated CEO Adrian McKenzie.

Management at DNA is working to grow the business, on the premise of increasing growth and shareholder value. ¬†The company is also updating and reconstructing its website to better reflect the nature of future business. However, those who have interest in the company can always learn more about our latest accomplishment by clicking our link below. ¬†In addition to the recent Rideshare Business, the company has also been in talks with some other very exciting cutting-edge disruptive opportunities, which it hopes to secure in the very near future.

DNA Brands Inc. has completed drafting a Reg A Subscription agreement, which it will look to submit to the SEC this week for their initial comments. ¬†¬†  


About the Rideshare/ Transportation Network Providers (TNP) Space:

A TNP company, also referred to as a rideshare company, provides prearranged transportation services for compensation through an Internet-enabled application or digital platform to connect passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire.¬†TNP drivers with their vehicles join and become affiliated with TNP companies, and are then available to be dispatched through the TNP‚Äôs digital platform. Uber and Lyft are the leaders in the industry, with Uber‚Äôs valuation being about $120 Billion and Lyft‚Äôs valuation at around $24+ Billion Dollars. ¬†¬†¬†

Lyft IPO‚Äôd on Friday, March 29, 2019, and along with Uber‚Äôs IPO that came out on May 10, 2019, they are being touted by investment banking professionals from around the world as the next major shift in the TNP sector. ¬†

Investors in Uber, who currently dominate the rideshare space, include those from Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Japan‚Äôs Softbank. According to cnbc.com, their urban mobility platform is still growing, and Uber‚Äôs Gross bookings were $37 billion in 2017, up from $20 billion in 2016. Net revenue (the amount left after paying drivers) reached $7.4 billion in 2017, an increase of nearly 14 percent over the prior year. Also fueling the company's growth is UberEATS, which was launched in 2016. The food-delivery service is now available in 120 cities worldwide, and is actually bigger than the company's ride-hailing business in several Asian markets, including Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul, and South Korea.  


Investors in Lyft have included CapitalG, Alliance Bernstein, KKR, Japanese retailer Rakuten, and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board. With all eyes on these two Behemoths, the playing fields and ancillary growth opportunities are plenty.

LAS VEGAS, May 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCMKTS: ISBG) (‚ÄúISBG‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a top-tier brand incubator in the Global Wine &amp; Spirits and CBD-Infused Products markets, is excited to announce that it is now open to and pursuing strategic partnerships as a pathway to accelerated growth in its brand incubation operations in both its adult beverage and CBD divisions.  


‚ÄúWe believe there is an opportunity to sharply ratchet up our top and bottom line growth through strategic partnerships in both of our major divisions,‚Äù commented ISBG CEO Terry Williams. ‚ÄúThe goal is to increase shareholder value. And the most powerful steps in that direction are often about unlocking the value that‚Äôs already there. That means exploiting implicit synergies. In this case, we believe we can form an ecosystem of products through partnerships that leverage our strengths while widening our overall market footprint.‚Äù

Management believes that there are inherent advantages of working through collaborative partnership structures in both the adult beverage and CBD marketplaces, where the value of the whole relationship is greater than the literal sum of its parts due to inherent synergies between partners and the rapid growth seen in these markets. The CBD segment alone is anticipated to grow over 2,000% over the next 36 months according to recent research from multiple analysts.

In addition, the Company has tremendous experiential capital in brand incubation. This suggests newer product assets originating with other companies may find an accelerated path to market and an increased brand upside by leveraging ISBG‚Äôs brand incubation, supply chain, and distribution capabilities, and its understanding of cross border regulatory factors in incorporating complex supply chain processes.

‚ÄúWe can see only upside by opening up to an ecosystem approach through an increased focus on strategic partnerships,‚Äù continued Mr. Williams. ‚ÄúWe expect a collaborative operating model to increase opportunities to scale up in both of our primary segments, with a likely impact on our projections for Q3 and Q4 of 2019, and beyond.‚Äù",2019-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bo6zyn/isbg_announces_increased_focus_on_strategic/
