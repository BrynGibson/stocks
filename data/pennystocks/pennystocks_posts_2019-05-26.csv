Completely disregard this. It is impossible for Workhorse to buy the Lordstown complex, and I‚Äôll show you why. WKHS is in the middle of a death spiral financing agreement with Arosa Capital Management and Marathon¬†Asset Management. Arosa is owned by Till Bechtolsheimer , grandson of¬†[**Karl-Heinz Kipp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Kipp), the founder of the Massa¬†department store chain. His sisters wedding was attended by the likes of Prince Harry, Prince William, and numerous other prominent royals.

At first, it wasn‚Äôt readily apparent who Till Bechtolsheimer was. When he participated in the GP of Monaco racing event, there was an article written about him that pretended he was some [*mystery man.*](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/19/workhorse-a-trump-and-dump-fit-for-royalty/)

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find out who he was though, because in 2014, his girlfriend (I‚Äôm guessing ex girlfriend now) was party to an altercation where it is claimed she[ **smashed a beer bottle over the back of a mans head**](https://web.archive.org/web/20190509010704/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-defend-friend-of-duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-accused-of-beer-bottle-attack-in-club-9138649.html) for daring to bump into her royal boyfriend at a nightclub. It gets even better. Apparently she was the former vice president of HSBC‚Äôs derivatives and structured products arm in New York. What a coincidence.

Okay, so now that we know who our mystery man is, lets move on to the real story. There was roughly 20 million warrant shares registered in S-3‚Äôs recently acquired pursuant to a loan agreement with Arosa and Marathon last year. Before Trump issued that Royal Pump on twitter, WKHS was trading under $1.00, and risked being delisted by the Nasdaq. Seems very convenient doesn‚Äôt it?

[https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9](https://imgur.com/jrBWDe9) Arosa S-3 filing

[https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j](https://imgur.com/vwxbY4j) Marathon S-3 filing

Marathon owns about 10 million warrants, and Arosa 8 million. The exercise price of the warrants has been adjusted down a few times, and as of now they currently sit at $1.25, down from $2.00. The circumstances surrounding how Arosa received these warrants is most unusual‚Ä¶

[https://imgur.com/IS93T8g](https://imgur.com/IS93T8g) Loan Agreement Covenants

Huh?‚Ä¶.So Arosa loans the company money, then 5 months later they get paid back with a new loan from a completely different lender, but they get to keep the 5 million warrants? That‚Äôs one hell of a deal.

Workhorse also recently sold a large asset to Duke Energy, which at the time was being used as collateral in the Arosa loan agreement. Personally, and this is completely my opinion, this transaction reminds me of what they refer to as a [**‚Äúbust out‚Äù** ](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/24/bain-capital-tony-soprano_n_1542249.html). Many of you remember how Mitt Romney affiliated Bain Capital would lend to struggling companies under aggressive terms, [**loot the company of the their assets, then fire everybody**](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/greed-and-debt-the-true-story-of-mitt-romney-and-bain-capital-183291/). Activity like this is not uncommon in death spiral financing arrangements. Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible for the borrower to secure financing, but due to desperation, they will agree to whatever terms are available with the hope that things might turn around. This isn‚Äôt the kind of behavior you‚Äôd expect from a company in legitimate talks with General Motors to buy the Lordstown Complex, a 6.2 million square foot facility (getting to that soon).

[https://imgur.com/U49I51k](https://imgur.com/U49I51k) Duke Sale

One of the covenants of the Arosa loan is that Workhorse is to sell [**Surefly**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2018/10/23/meet-surefly-a-hybrid-electric-helicopter-that-looks-like-a-drone/), one of their most important assets. They manufacturer an interesting Multicopter prototype, something that, with the right leadership, has true potential.

They also accrued a warranty liability of 6.9 million in 2018 for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lot of money to put aside, and a colossal fuck up considering the timing. They are barely scraping by.

[https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF](https://imgur.com/WcmLtkF) Warranty Liability

Just one look at their operations makes it pretty clear that the dilution is not even close to being over. Yes, that‚Äôs a quarterly..

[https://imgur.com/H40jw3S](https://imgur.com/H40jw3S) Most Recent 10-Q

They even tell you they don‚Äôt have enough money to make it through to the second half of THIS year, not next year‚Ä¶THIS year! Seriously?! And Trump pumped this thing!!! This is insanity!

Also, they admit that the financing from Arosa and Marathon is for further inventory purchases. No mention of capital expenditure.

[https://imgur.com/IokM41c](https://imgur.com/IokM41c) 2018 10-K, only 700k in sales???!!

Net sales went down 93%????‚Ä¶..Okay, lets take a step back here. 2017 sales were 10 million, but 2018 sales are only $700k? The expenses are almost the same for both years though, so when you do the math, 2018 expenses are 3000% of net sales??? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WTF??!! The question we have to ask ourselves now is HOW DO THEY EXPECT TO BUY A 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT 902 ACRE PRODUCTION FACILITY WHEN THEY HAVE VIRTUALLY NO SALES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING UP TO THEIR PANTS IN DEBT TO EUROPEAN NOBILITY!!!!! THIS IS AN INSULT TO OUR INTELLIGENCE, OR AS TRUMP LIKES SAYING, ‚ÄúA DISGRACE‚Äù!!!!!!

Last, but not least, their competitors are massive corporations with 100‚Äôs of years of combined experience..I could keep going on, but I think you get the point by now. The company is facing bankruptcy, had virtually no sales last year, and the covenants in the loan agreement require them to sell one of their most important assets. They put aside 7 million for a warranty liability for batteries that are ‚Äúdefective‚Äù, while selling another few million in batteries to Duke Energy.

Not going to lie, this was a no DD investment for me.  

Someone I met and have been talking to on Twitter told me I should buy in back around the beginning of March and just hold.  He's someone I trust so I threw a decent chunk of money at it.  

It's dropped significantly since Tuesday and had pretty low volume the last couple days.  No idea if it's a P&amp;D.

&amp;#x200B;

Im new to penny stocks, and im working on doing some fake trading before I jump in and lose my ass. I have a question about AXMM for some of you more experienced members.

&amp;#x200B;

So! I was trolling around for some good penny stocks, and found this one on a list posted here earlier by Transparent\_Traders ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystocktrading/comments/btauz5/my\_top\_otc\_penny\_stocks\_to\_watch\_for\_the\_week\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystocktrading/comments/btauz5/my_top_otc_penny_stocks_to_watch_for_the_week_of/) )

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance it seems good. Stocks jumping, volumes picked up, so I started looking for more information. No news found, no events, no anything as far as I can tell on google. I was wondering if this was normal behavior for penny stocks? Is there some other venue I can search for news or happenings on smaller stocks that wouldnt pop up on google? Or is this just an old fashioned pump and dump?

&amp;#x200B;
