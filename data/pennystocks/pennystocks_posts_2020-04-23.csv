With that said i would love someone to tell what I understand is wrong. But after googling the words in the Press Release MY understanding is that they are starting the process of exchanging old senior notes for new ones and or sending new term agreements to the current holders of the senior notes. 

Probably should've said this first but senior notes are a bond a company will issue that takes precedence over other debts IF a company goes bankrupt. so the fact they are increasing the percent  return has to be good right? Time to check out the 10-k's. DO YOUR OWN DD AND TRY TO GOOGLE. 

I have no idea how this will effect the stock but if you want to figure it out more these are the definitions i read. Just send me a PM when you figure it out I'm going to bed.

\*\*Cons\*\*: 

&amp;#x200B;

Their EPS has been crushed over the number of quarters especially most recently. However, 2019 appears to shed some light on improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Common questions I will be answering below:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1) Long or short? I would do either or

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is it a good time to buy now or wait? Hell yes, it's a good time to buy. But if you're that cautious, wait till 0.40 &amp; in fact, if someone is planning to buy now, 0.40 is the safe exit.

&amp;#x200B;

3) How long should I hold? I can't answer that. I always believe in the rule of thumb never get too greedy. Things such as public offering (not to be confused with direct offering), the decision for r / s, or notices should always be kept on the lookout if the tides change. As the saying goes, what comes up must come down. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) How certain are you? About 95% certain. The only uncertainty would be if any sort of news announces otherwise that would make me change my mind or short it. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Are you in it now? No, I will be buying it in the morning most likely, or observe for an open window opportunity for a dip.

&amp;#x200B;

6) \*\*Where can I learn your methods?\*\* or... ""I'm a newb, I don't know what I'm doing"". In a nutshell, I was once like you; clueless, young &amp; dumb and didn't know jack squat in the days of playing an OTC such as DCPN. A had a cup of coffee between me and a rich fella a long time ago at the time I was a bum nearly with no clear insight. He noticed something about me that most didn't; he said I was very analytical and I like figuring stuff out. There, he mentioned, ""ya know, analytical or over-analyzing is a good trait for trading"". He smiled and I didn't understand a damn word he was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched many top dog traders high and low, including notorious Tim Sykes. What they would teach you is old tricks with bells and whistles in either some form triangle scheme matter roping you into paying for a class that teaches you barely minimum what you can learn yourself on the interwebs. The only exceptional knowledgable thing you can learn from an entity or a person is the preferred and respected Stephen Dux. 

&amp;#x200B;

Number one, don't pay shit. Excuse my language but I can't emphasize this enough. Don't even pay for auto-alerts subs either. Because those things are already ahead of the game before you. To be currently IN THE GAME is having an active live scanner you make yourself, a reputable discord (such as TradingKingEric a well respected Stocktwit user), or system that has an accurate real-time scanner. As far as understanding when to enter or exit, I highly recommend watching The Secret Mindset on youtube; they will teach you the basics. If you're not a candle guy, then you're a chart guy (like me ;) ) it's either one or the other no matter if you're a day trader, short, or long.

7) How long does it take for you to review these things? 2 hours and backtracking past &amp; present. It can be slightly exhausting. It would be nice if some folks would accommodate me some credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

8) Which one are you buying? Kinda torn between BNGO &amp; CDEV. I personally feel CDEV might be it because it's more controllable versus something too quick and too loose like BNGO being volatile.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What's with the lines? What do they mean?\*\* It's a style I have been studying for the past two years called EMA; I use 4 settings that help me understand the chart's strengths and weaknesses whether day trading, short term, or long term. If you look at the webull chart, that color line red (the 99ema) is essential like bread and water. If that falls below that line, it's like driving a bike with a busted wheel ready to crash and burn, but it can also be used as a dip-buy tactic as well whether day trading or long term trading.

Now, I want to make things very clear. I don't like looking at OTC/OTK but there's one I did make an exception of looking at because it's becoming noticed, intriguing in chart behavior, &amp; point of interest from business to business perspective. \*\*DECN\*\* has been a sleeping dead cat for a long time. The fact it's becoming a booming ticker regarding covid-19 is a clear sign for a point of interest. For those entering or still holding, I highly recommend a safeguard exit in case something goes south falling bellow 0.20. DECN shows a clear bullish flag on the daily chart and the intraday chart on any time frame (i.e. 5min-15min) leads me to believe it's promising.

&amp;#x200B;

BNGO - Now, I haven't heard from this little guy in a while until I noticed some activity overnight the same thing with CDEV. It's found a bottom HODL at 0.26, the potential minimum gap at 0.77, and a max gap that can be aimed possibly 1.3. The reason I'm saying 1.3 because I'm being mindful about the past it struck above $3 in the past which means there's still bag holders in the past ready to unload once the stock explodes again ready to sell to either profit/average out. BNGO also appears to be fully squeezed out from the bears or aka just are fed up with it judging from the MACD.

Distinguishably, the chart shows a clear healthy sign of HODL style as well. I've never had this type of excitement since the day I went after INPX. There are already enough reasons why I like this chart and the stock alone; energy resource demand &amp; it has options. **A potential gap window of $2 with an open window max gap of $3.5+ if anything possibly more.** No matter how I look at it in my favorite frames, it still looks like an outside bar no matter what curving OUT of the downtrend.

More than 25 analysis is heavily intrigued by this stock leading between a HODL &amp; underperformed. While underperformed might sound bad, but it sounds heavily attractive to those interested in the long term since it has found a clear bottom at 0.23

**Cons**: 

Their EPS has been crushed over the number of quarters especially most recently. However, 2019 appears to shed some light on improvement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Common questions I will be answering below:**

1) Long or short? I would do either or

2) Is it a good time to buy now or wait? Hell yes, it's a good time to buy. But if you're that cautious, wait till 0.40 &amp; in fact, if someone is planning to buy now, 0.40 is the safe exit.

3) How long should I hold? I can't answer that. I always believe in the rule of thumb never get too greedy. Things such as public offering (not to be confused with direct offering), the decision for r / s, or notices should always be kept on the lookout if the tides change. As the saying goes, what comes up must come down. 

4) How certain are you? About 95% certain. The only uncertainty would be if any sort of news announces otherwise that would make me change my mind or short it. 

5) Are you in it now? No, I will be buying it in the morning most likely, or observe for an open window opportunity for a dip.

6) **Where can I learn your methods?** or... ""I'm a newb, I don't know what I'm doing"". In a nutshell, I was once like you; clueless, young &amp; dumb and didn't know jack squat in the days of playing an OTC such as DCPN. A had a cup of coffee between me and a rich fella a long time ago at the time I was a bum nearly with no clear insight. He noticed something about me that most didn't; he said I was very analytical and I like figuring stuff out. There, he mentioned, ""ya know, analytical or over-analyzing is a good trait for trading"". He smiled and I didn't understand a damn word he was talking about.

I've researched many top dog traders high and low, including notorious Tim Sykes. What they would teach you is old tricks with bells and whistles in either some form triangle scheme matter roping you into paying for a class that teaches you barely minimum what you can learn yourself on the interwebs. The only exceptional knowledgable thing you can learn from an entity or a person is the preferred and respected Stephen Dux. 

Number one, don't pay shit. Excuse my language but I can't emphasize this enough. Don't even pay for auto-alerts subs either. Because those things are already ahead of the game before you. To be currently IN THE GAME is having an active live scanner you make yourself, a reputable discord (such as TradingKingEric a well respected Stocktwit user), or system that has an accurate real-time scanner. As far as understanding when to enter or exit, I highly recommend watching The Secret Mindset on youtube; they will teach you the basics. If you're not a candle guy, then you're a chart guy (like me ;) ) it's either one or the other no matter if you're a day trader, short, or long.

Oftentimes government moves slowly, but they also tend to build large doors and then open them. DECN views this as an opportunity to become the first company to provide an all-in-one, immediate result, individual at-home Covid-19 test kits with its GenViro! Swift kit for at-home use. We intend to file our stand-alone EUA application for the individual use GenViro! Swift kit by May 1. We anticipate the application to include data gleaned from our GenViro Professional kit application. We also anticipate a request to direct us to conduct a donor study of a modest group of donors. We have already identified a group in Pennsylvania to make use of the Genviro! Swift Home kit. Additional testing required for this kit is anticipated to take less than a week. ""

DD so far that I've done shows the following:

* They seem to be leaders in HPV vaccine.
* Have several ""cancer"" vaccines currently in trials.
* Making a coronavirus vaccine play as well, currently undergoing trials (partnership with the National Research Council of Canada).

And **THIS** is where my ears perked up: They recently appointed a 27 year veteran of Sanofi leadership to their Board Of Directors, Damian Braga.

Some folks are thinking that the company may be struggling financially but has solid products so a buy out may be on the horizon, and if not for the recent appointee mentioned above, I wouldn't believe it.  ;)

Do your DD and good luck to those who get in!  Looks like a longer play but could return some short-term returns.

     The answer is fidelity because it is free, they don't charge, and you can make the account, add your funds, and trade instantly without any wait period.  

*Other ones (charles shwab) make you wait 3 days before you can buy an OTC stock (DECN). 
*Other ones (TDameritrade) make charge you PER transaction, yes, they literally charge you 6.95$. so thats a big fat no for people only throwing a little money in.

I don't know why nobody literally answered this question, I had to go through rabbit holes opening up accounts etc and talking to customer service to figure it out.

I posted an exit strategy on DECN yesterday those of you that followed probably made some money, or at least broke even. No you can argue that Stop losses were the reason for the huge shit it took yada yada yada doesn't matter. Always protect your profits. 

If you were smart you would have seen how big of a panic this sell off was (looks like an inverted exponential curve) and you would know from experience its gonna get a bounce back up. I don't expect you to time the bottom but when you see that last red candle starting to push back up (bottom wick getting longer, red getting smaller) buy back in. Now I don't expect you to exactly hit the peak either. In this case I was off by about another 8 cents potentially missing out on another 25% or so. BUT, I made money and that's what counts.

It appears they have also seen departures of employees and hired new ones. I‚Äôm not sure what the indemnity agreement means going forward for holders of this REIT

Could anybody shed some light on what this 8-k could mean going forward into earnings?

&amp;#x200B;

moral of the story: don't chase a stock that is becoming overcrowded and seems to be ""unstoppable"" because half of you are catching it late and your stop losses are getting executed late making you loose money.",2020-04-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g6vieq/idiots_on_decn_using_trailing_stop_losses_causing/
