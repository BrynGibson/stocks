0,Concern with XNET,dn6w4r,RealStratBeckerYT,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dn6w4r/concern_with_xnet/,12,11," Hi all! First post here, making videos for these types of stocks for a large discord community so I thought I'd share thoughts on reddit too. Strong feeling here that this is going to dump heavy next week back to the 2.5 levels. It ran today over 100% on NO news at all. Not just that but had over 61 million volume, something it has never done in a single day before, even during the bitcoin craze of late 2017 and early 2018. Feel like communities pumped this hardcore and that it's going to come down hard next week. Feel free to comment any thoughts!",2019-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dn6w4r/concern_with_xnet/
