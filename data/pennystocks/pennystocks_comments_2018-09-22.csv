First, a news release on then actually starting the next trials. They're supposed to start the dosage/metabolic study in september but have postponed due to administrative problems (government, pills arriving, etc). Thus they have next week on them, and when asking the company they say they're still ""on time, just a few more days"" basically.

Secondly, Kwang Dong came months after Wallace's attendance at a GI/biomed conference in South Korea (I think in April). He later visited Vietnam and Brazil, among others. If ATB-346 is as groundbreaking as it seems, there should be interest from these countries, and some more regional deals are in the works. ",2018-09-22

Yesterday's dip could've just been profit taking after a crazy week in the sector, which seems to happen on Fridays. People could have bailed after watching TLRY tank, too...markets can be sentimental. 

If the news at next week's presentation is big then you can bet it'll affect the stock price (duh). I dipped my toes yesterday at 4.55, we'll see what happens.",2018-09-22

I don’t like how their using the proceeds. They don’t control the manufacturing process and only plan to use 25% of the IPO gains to manufacturing? Cmon.

Exciting sectors elsewhere and a delay of about 4 months killed the sentiment towards the company over the summer. 

It will shift in the fall/early winter as people reposition to get in before results either to hold or to trade the higher volume and prices as it runs to results as many biotechs do.

 New trial starting imminently will be short then I assume 2 or 3 weeks to decide doses and get HC approval and then start recruiting for the proper study. wouldnt be surprised to see the price continue to climb another couple weeks then a small selloff after the trial starts until the flock comes back. 

Great things coming.... eventually",2018-09-22
