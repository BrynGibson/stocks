2,GLFH - 8k - 5/3 - Acquires Fleaux Services LLC!,8gwea8,Saints420Fan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gwea8/glfh_8k_53_acquires_fleaux_services_llc/,2,2,"https://fintel.io/doc/www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1574676/000106299318001893/form8k.htm

8k - The acquisition is contingent on Galenfeha‚Äôs ability to raise the funds, and the Company has engaged Wall Street firm Paulson Investment Company, LLC as the lead placement agent for financing the transaction.

Galenfeha‚Äôs founder, Mr. James Ketner stated: ‚ÄúWe have a lot of work to do, and I want to inform the public of some upcoming changes, so there are no surprises. Mr. Trey Moore, President/CEO, and founder of Fleaux Services, is assuming the role of Galenfeha‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. I believe there is nobody more qualified to take the position, as he is a young, charismatic leader with a great operational history in the oil and gas industry. He has the ability to lead the company to continued growth in the future. I will be working directly with Mr. Moore over the next several months as he transitions into the role.‚Äù

Building on his historic relationships in the oil and gas industry, Trey Moore founded Fleaux Services six years ago. The company is now a premier provider of oil and gas measurement, automation, and control equipment, boasting revenues of approximately $21m in 2016, approximately $36m in 2017, and revenues for first quarter 2018 of approximately $12m.

Here‚Äôs a list of the companies Paulson has helped uplist to the big boards by the way. Can you find any start ups listed under 5.00$. Seriously look for yourself I stopped after the first dozen. So GLFH is acquiring a business that makes money hand over fist....acquiring a placement agent to acquire even more investors that has uplisted numerous companies to the big leagues for multiple dollars

I made an old post about this with some great DD a while ago. This is only trading a .23 I think. Amazing price considering where this is going!

Previous 8k before this purchase a while back described how they projected 0.04 EPS and 8 Mil revenue from their existing company. That‚Äôs a 0.80 PPS projection! 

Read up on the filings on this one gents. It‚Äôs all there. Pretty easy to find. 10Q deadline for this one is May 15th which will show their revenues from Q1 ‚Äî-&gt; the real catalyst that sends this up another level. Enjoy!",2018-05-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gwea8/glfh_8k_53_acquires_fleaux_services_llc/
