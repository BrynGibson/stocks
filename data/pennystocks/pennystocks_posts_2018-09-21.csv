15,NVCN Reverse Split,9hmkt1,menardo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9hmkt1/nvcn_reverse_split/,6,13,"Neovasc Inc. will have a 1:100 stock split before market open Friday Sept. 21st, bringing their OS from 1.9B OS to 19M OS and their float to anywhere from a few million to even a few hundred thousand. Here are some notables:

They beat their last earnings by 20%

Presenting at the TCT conference on Sunday and Monday (conference starts tomorrow)

Recently implanted their 100th life-saving Reducer product into a patient

Their products are yielding over 90% life-changing success

Dilution is more then 98% complete

Formed a great partnership in August of 2018 (only a month ago)

Currently in the process of resolving a lawsuit over copyright infringement, future results of the lawsuit are looking good based on past litigations 

RS post price will be $2.95, still room for dropping so be cautious with your money.

There is plenty more good info on this company to give it a future outlook for Longs. Do your own DD and you may come across more info on their Reducer and Tiara products, or maybe some stuff about the current lawsuit. 


Overall this company is one of the most shorted stocks on the NASDAQ, so it turns out be a risky stock along with its toxic financing that the previous CEO threw them into in late 2017. Their new CEO has been doing great which is why, despite it being a poor stock at the moment, it’s a great company company overall. If you’re looking for an entry point, I would keep your eye on this company starting tomorrow. I hope someone takes these notes and uses them to their bull/bear advantage! Good luck everybody!",2018-09-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9hmkt1/nvcn_reverse_split/
