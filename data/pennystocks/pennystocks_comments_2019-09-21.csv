Pennies are all pump and dumps fluffed up by numerous pr filings. Nothing is ""real"" , they're all bogus dreams being pumped by guys that reverse split their way to profit. Energy might be great now, shit will tank in a bad way once that cycles out. There were people investing in a shrimp tank in here, think about that. Theres an ocean full of shrimp and people think they can crank out man made shrimp to fill the needs of multiple retailers",2019-09-21

8,bak2bakchamp,f0y8u5j,/r/pennystocks/comments/d78mc9/energy_penny_stocks_have_returned_some_amazing/f0y8u5j/,1,"you are wrong because you arnt understanding my point...  if you actually put in some time &amp; effort,  research into these oil / gas  company's,  you can work out whats under valued and whats garbage / shill company. its not hard too spot after some studying.  You can see what  farm out deals they have currently, or maybe close too drilling dates  / confirmed large resource size of gas / oil..the list can go on.

it is not a "" pump and dump "" if its a soild project,  im talking about investing in a company that has confirmed a target. not just a random pick on the market.   dont think you get what i mean, but i do agree, the retail / tech/ health care penny stocks are garbage and i never tryed with anyhting other then oil/gas small caps. and have had far more success then any of my "" long term "" shares i hold.   i dont mean to argue i just trying to create a conversation on this sector..cheers",2019-09-21

12,km48879,f0zwhok,/r/pennystocks/comments/d746rn/50_in_free_stocks_no_catch/f0zwhok/,1,That's ok. You might be repulsed by the posting but this is the easiest money I have ever seen. $50 to open  no free stock account. $100 to open fee free checking account. Then you open another for your spouse with a referral bonus plus the free money. Takes 5 minutes to make $250.,2019-09-21

The money is in your account within 2 days. Then you transfer it all back to your regular account and dont use the SOFI ever again unless you want the 1.8 percent interest rate that beats your. 001 percent your getting now. Free money is free money whether Im a looser jerk or a MLM participant or not. Do you need some essential oils hun?",2019-09-21
15,therealmattsteimel,f114x6c,/r/pennystocks/comments/d746rn/50_in_free_stocks_no_catch/f114x6c/,2,My point was you don't have a spouse if your plan is to open an account in their name because some random reddit user said to. Not to mention your trying way to hard here. On the off chance your not full of shit and this isn't some scam you've ruined it by being an arrogant ass.,2019-09-21
16,km48879,f116i1b,/r/pennystocks/comments/d746rn/50_in_free_stocks_no_catch/f116i1b/,1,Just being silly.. We share finances and do this with credit card cash signup bonus as well. I do one and she does one for a double bonus . I am surprised I just found out about this bank. It even offers crypto currency. They don't even require direct deposit. The only scammy thing i noticed about it is they make most of their money on student loans. The bank account offer is better than the stock offer.  https://www.sofi.com/share/money/2680887/,2019-09-21
