1,HMPQ doing the new stock market game right.,ad63he,Krisforfun,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ad63he/hmpq_doing_the_new_stock_market_game_right/,1,2,"There are a CBD / hemp company and they are already ahead of the rest of the game.

When you stop and think about the market dips over the last year, most of the problems stem from lies and deceit at the core of their organizations.

Facebook is doing all of the right things expanding their business, but their stock is taking hits due to secrets and lies.

HempAmericana is going full throttle on social media was sharing their updates for the whole world to see.

They're not hiding anything, they're showing everyone exactly what they are and exactly where they are going.

Transparency is a game-changer in today's business, and HONESTY is what makes money in a market full of competition.

Are you more likely to invest in a company that shows you everything they are doing, or are you more likely to invest in a company that tells you what they expect to have happened?

I loaded up before, but I'll be loading up even more.

I'm not an expert at the investment game, I just do a lot of reading in my spare time when it comes to psycology.

I know when people don't trust an organization, they are not loyal to an organization. That means they will cash out in the short-term.

When you trust an organization, because you see that they are being honest with you, you're more excited to stick with them in the long term.

Hempamericana is building trust, and they are doing all the hard work that billionaires like to see done.
