1,Tim Grittani- Trading Tickers,duqa6a,SbENAks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/duqa6a/tim_grittani_trading_tickers/,1,20,"Hey Everyone, 

I have just finished Tim's Trading Tickers DVD. It was quite expensive but really helpful. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in buying it. I can share the links to the files on MEGA so that you can download the videos. 

The actual price of the product is around $1000USD (on sale). I will allow you to download the full course for $100AUD ($69USD).

Also, payments will be made through PayPal and I will be able to create a PayPal invoice mentioning the condition that I offer full refund if I don't deliver the contents as promised for some reason. 

Email me at [snakhoul04@gmail.com](mailto:snakhoul04@gmail.com) if you are interested. 

Thank you :)",2019-11-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/duqa6a/tim_grittani_trading_tickers/

10,ILA (ILATF and ILA.V) looks like its taking off...,duu0yv,Clineran1066,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/duu0yv/ila_ilatf_and_ilav_looks_like_its_taking_off/,1,1,"ILA is looking better and better.

I like the chart, the technicals are looking strong.

Volume has been way up over the last month or so (a little lighter at the tail of last week - I think from offerings drying up).

The first quarter of consolidated financials come out by the end of November.

Based on the interviews below 2.5X EV/REV is a \~$0.75 cent stock and comparables are trading at 4.5X. at $0.75 that's about 3X from here at 4.5X that's about 7x.

They just hired an IR firm (Adelaide Capital) - so I would expect marketing to increase (hopefully some news as well)

I listened to the podcast on Stockhouse:

[https://stockhouse.com/opinion/interviews/2019/09/27/stableview-tech-podcast-with-colin-fisher-and-gary-yeoman](https://stockhouse.com/opinion/interviews/2019/09/27/stableview-tech-podcast-with-colin-fisher-and-gary-yeoman) 

and an interview that spoke about them on Midas Letter:

[https://youtu.be/k6enKIv1AAY](https://youtu.be/k6enKIv1AAY)

&amp;#x200B;

Just FYI, both the interviews involve StableView Asset Management (they are a key shareholder based on filings).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my previous post on ILA:

I've lurked on reddit for a long time - first time post. Please be kind.

A broker I know in Toronto went to a tech conference last week and he has been raving about a real estate tech company (he uses the term proptech) that presented.

The name of the company is ilookabout. The tickers are: ILA on the TSX Venture exchange and ILATF on the US OTCQB

Here's the website:

[http://www.ilookabout.com/](http://www.ilookabout.com/)

Here is their investor deck:

[http://www.ilookabout.com/investor-relations/presentations/](http://www.ilookabout.com/investor-relations/presentations/)

His key points were this:

1. Really good Management:
   1. Gary Yeoman founded Altus Group Limited (AIF on Toronto Stock Exchange). He also was the founding investor in Real Matters (REAL).
   2. Jordan Ross joined from Altus
2. New Board Member from BMO (Bank of Montreal)
3. Tightly held stock structure. Insiders, Management, Institutions hold around 70% of the stock.
4. Super cheap price  

   1. he said if you use $30M revenue which is about 20% over the last 12 months revenues of the two companies combined that you would have Enterprise Value/Revenue of about .70 while comparables are at 4.5. Simple math says that 2X EV/REV would be around 60 cents and that 4.5 X EV/REV would be $1.50

Looking at their presentation it looks like a serious company with serious clients. Management looks amazing.

&amp;#x200B;
