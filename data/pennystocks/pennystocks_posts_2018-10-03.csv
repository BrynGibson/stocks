One tip is made, no due diligence is done or even considered, everyone piles in to the hype and reinforce their thinking when the stock goes up 20% in a day from their own buys.

I can only assume then that a few people profit from cashing out, prior to the stock falling back down to its garbage price.

Perfect example is LODE which everyone hyped about yesterday, fundamentals are complete trash. I honestly see that company circling drain and will not be in for long. 

There’s been some real winners picked by the few here but my point is to remember to do your own analysis people and don’t just jump aboard the hype.

PHOENIX, Oct. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Premier Biomedical, Inc. (OTCQB:**[BIEI](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-st05AwrsQ95gBG3z3Su_eMwyc3Qnh1b0w9VDQ0DuyMXqKUkkD0NOhwbb0bX5O5fAaG_DgBMkhjwsgXEvN1_UN0Ugl7whRBi4b0_HnZy1rk=)**) (“Premier Biomedical, Inc.” or the “company”)** is looking for new strategies and joint ventures to sell CBD. CEO and President of Premier Biomedical, Inc., William A. Hartman, talked with Stock Day’s Everett Jolly about recent issues facing his industry and company.  


Mr. Jolly asked Mr. Hartman where Premier Biomedical, Inc. stands on a recent joint venture. He eluded to a few issues that have arisen but says their reasons for wanting to pursue a joint venture are as relevant as ever.

“We are targeting Europe,” explained Mr. Hartman. “In Europe, CBD was declared a medicine. In order to enter the market, we have to make a joint venture in Europe.”

He then went on to explain that they selected a partner and were poised to move forward. In the meantime, the company they hoped to work alongside was targeted for takeover by a third company and that has slowed the joint venture down.

“In the interim, we have picked another company with whom to have a joint venture. This company is not quite as desirable, but because of laws in different countries involved with these partners we can actually have two joint ventures.”

Mr. Hartman then told Mr. Jolly that while Premier Biomedical, Inc. was exploring these joint ventures a mass distributor, with 15,000 outlets in the U.S., decided to start handling CBD and chose Premier Biomedical, Inc.

“This mass distributor has noted we need entry level products,” said Hartman. “Just this week we’ve identified 5 new products and we are working on pricing.”

Mr .Hartman also acknowledged to Mr. Jolly that his industry needs to do more on social media and other public forums to make sure people realize that CBD is a pain relief drug and is a legal drug.

“Hartman stated that Premier has continued to present their products to the DOD and is confident that the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, S-2667, sponsored by Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, will be the catalyst that opens up sales opportunities with the DOD as well as with social media.” 

Hartman also added that he is confident in a bright future for topical hemp oil/ CBD pain relief products and for Premier Biomedical as a leader in that market.

""Digital is committed to working with the Lakota Tribal Cooperative to create jobs and revenue within the community,"" says Digital CEO. Maurice Stone.

According to Stone, the investment will be used for all aspects of the operation from planting and harvesting, to the purchase or lease of heavy-duty tractors, harvesters, truck trailers, grain drills, dryers, pelletizers, irrigation equipment, buildings and building the extraction facility.

""We, along with the Lakota Tribal Cooperative, envision both short and long-term growth as the laws regarding industrial hemp evolve to reflect the reality what hemp means for producers and consumers, in the US and internationally,"" says Stone.

Hemp and its extracts are currently illegal at the Federal level, having been lumped together with marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, along with cocaine and heroin. In reality, hemp and its extracted CBD do not have the same psychoactive effect as the THC found in marijuana. In fact, many components of CBD counteract the ""high"" people get from THC. As a result, the attitudes and laws around hemp and CBD are changing. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization recommended hemp and CBD be removed from the list of controlled substances in all nations. 

The 2018 Farm Bill currently making its way through Congress includes a provision to legalize hemp and CBD in all 50 states. Businesses both on and off Wall Street have been making moves in preparation for this seismic shift in the marketplace. In addition to the health benefits of CBD extracts, which include life changing medications for epileptics, and promising benefits for diabetics and those suffering from Parkinson's, industrial hemp has application in over 25,000 products. The fastest growth market for hemp is the auto industry, from plastics to fabric. Hemp offers fabrication versatility rarely seen from a single raw materials source. 

Based on current market conditions, we anticipate generating approximately $90,000 gross revenues per acre based on harvesting 1,700 plants per acre, which translates to approximately 10-kilos of CBD distillate per acre. We anticipate NET income from the 2019 crop to be in excess of $400,000,000.

""Everyone is waiting on the Farm Bill,"" said Stone. ""The current bill expired on September 30th and we hope to see a vote come through quickly. We anticipate more big news to come through on the heels of the changes in the law. Being able to cultivate interstate business will break the market wide open. DUTV has been working for the past year to be in a very strong position as this market evolves.""

31,My opinion on $PLUG and its expected growth,9l3bjb,rparnikov,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9l3bjb/my_opinion_on_plug_and_its_expected_growth/,1,0,"Plug power is an undervalued company which is going to pop soon with a price target of $3.89, a 87% increase over its current price. It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 127 $3 11/16 calls based around its 11/8 earning report, there will be a run up closer to the report date. Depending on the report itself may think about reinvesting more for the long term.

​

Walmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. All eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares. Ignore the misleading title of the article and read content for a breakdown of the institutional investor increases: ([https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html](https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/23/insider-selling-plug-power-inc-nasdaqplug-director-sells-31343-shares-of-stock.html)).

​

The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Plug Power will see the results of opening new factory, developing robots to take advantage of autonomous forklifts and delivery trucks, and developing new tech to double power storage. Buy $PLUG $3 11/16 calls, also may try risky $3 or $2.5 11/2 calls. $AMZN, $NKE, and $WMT already use their equipment (and will purchase more) and $FDX has conducted 7500mi of deliveries in the Albany area using a Plug Power powered FedEx truck. Institutional investors have doubled their positions by millions of shares and all eight of its board members have purchase shares four times since the beginning of the year.",2018-10-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9l3bjb/my_opinion_on_plug_and_its_expected_growth/

This is me giving back.

&amp;#x200B;

Word on the street for why $LODE has jumped these last two days is because investor confidence in it is up due to their getting a swanky award from regulators (""[Comstock Mining Receives National Sustainable Mineral Development Award; BLM Recognizes the Exceptional Reclamation of the Historic Silver Hill Mine Shaft](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/comstock-mining-receives-national-sustainable-mineral-development-award-blm-recognizes-the-20181001-00261)"").

That's all well and good, but lets look at why $LODE is going to be the new $IGC rather than some penny pauper pump-n-dump prostitute some in this sub claim her to be.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- 1. Good management that made tough past strategic decisions, 2. location, location, location, and 3. a foundation to build moon boots that would make [Elon](https://i.redd.it/x795u9uuhof01.png) jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **They tightened their belt, which hindered past profit, and paid off all debt:**

* For all practical purpose #LODE has eliminated the debt that in the past depressed the stock price. They've done this by [selling over $15 million](https://imgur.com/a/RwealUf) in real estate. No debt means no interest payments, so more money for us astronauts. No debt means they can [further leverage themselves](https://imgur.com/a/kb444j0) to better harness assets they have. Which leads us to...

**2. Assets (or why this A-cup penny stock is about to hit puberty and become the popular girl):**

* The amount of real estate $LODE owns and [its location](https://imgur.com/a/Eqi0fPJ) is absurd. Forget that they're a mining company – what brought them out of debt is real estate and that will only continue for the near to long-term future. **Why?** Because:
   * They're east of Lake Tahoe - California's premier *and by far* largest ski/snowboard destination. (They have land that's [east of the lake](https://www.zillow.com/carson-city-nv/home-values/), which historically has been the cheaper side compared to [South Lake Tahoe](https://www.zillow.com/south-lake-tahoe-ca/home-values/) and [Tahoe City](https://www.zillow.com/tahoe-city-ca/home-values/), but we'll get to that.)
   * North of Yosemite - Yes, that small, low-traffic national park.
   * [Southwest of Reno's industrial area](https://imgur.com/a/XlUud0p) \- This is the main geographical reason (best for last). In this zone we have Tesla's new gigafactory (largest battery factory in the world), Switch's new data center (largest data center in the world), Google's Nevada campus (read: we want to be as close to California as possible but pay Nevada taxes) which is where much of Google's [self-driving car research](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-nevada-google/google-gets-first-self-driven-car-license-in-nevada-idUSLNE84701320120508) is done, and other small companies like Walmart, Mars, Ebay, T.R.I.C., and Zulily.

""D3, that's all well and good, but stop being a fluffer and show me the numbers.""

**3. A foundation to launch us to the moon:**

* Land and water acquisitions [previously made at $3.2 millio](https://imgur.com/a/bNueWMt)n held for sale and valued currently at $7-10 million
* LODEs of hard to obtain [regulatory and environmental permits](https://imgur.com/a/5ASAmF9) that now allow them to mine (because they are a mining company after all)
   * Over [450k TONS of unmined gold](https://imgur.com/a/ojdWvbL) in one vein alone
   * Over [350k TONS of silver](https://imgur.com/a/iOYkxLK) and other precious dirt
   * and a fuck ton more moolah minerals they now can mine (see [page 22 - 30](https://comstockmining.com/images/stories/investor-library/Overview.pdf))

&amp;#x200B;

There are other things like their innovative business practices and [sexy meme coins](https://www.comstockmining.com/products/) (which I'll be buying for my ungrateful SO this Christmas once this stock hits $10) that I could go into, but honestly, I don't know how many of you bothered to read to this point.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, let's all make MONEY riding this west coast rocket ship. Anything under $1 is a steal for this stock. With the earnings report due to come [after the market closes on October 30th](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/crk), I'm at least trying to snap this up as quickly as possible before then (bless the $0.202 \~3:30 pm dip today).
