I guess one could say he is getting additional income off of this, but if what he is doing is really sustainable then there is actually zero incentive to teach people and make his edge ever decreasing. It would make more sense if this was a in person coaching/mentoring and the person signed a contract with him for *x* years and he gets a cut off of your profits during your duration. That would be the most logically way this goes about where he gets equal benefit for the work he puts into helping building someone from the ground up and getting a huge reward down the line when the person is successful in trading.",2018-07-14

Having more people moving your way on stocks does nothing but help you. That's why we have so many trash hole call out discords. Doesn't hurt to have a few noobies to burn in the markets too.

It’s fulfilling to see people learn all of the things that took me so long to learn very quickly. Additionally, the income flattens our the peaks and valleys that come with option trading. 

I don’t agree with giving people trade ideas or tips, but instead teaching them fundamentals. I’m not always right in my calls and I don’t want anyone losing money on one of my ideas. I’m happy to teach how options work, risk management strategies, etc, but where I draw the line is on giving advice. 

Always trade at your own risk and do your homework before putting your hard earned dollars at risk. ",2018-07-14
