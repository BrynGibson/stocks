8,Bubbs77,eue2inb,/r/pennystocks/comments/cg0xfn/ttcm_concern_posited_to_david_lamountain/eue2inb/,1,"  I agree whole heartedly with the FB poster and with Dave. My strategy for this stock is in consideration if both positions, as well as in consideration of standard OTC trading. 
   
This tech will be used via phone for awhile by a select group of folks that will enjoy it. The younger generation doesn’t   seem to have a problem with this. 

Coming home from town yesterday I witnessed four different people texting and driving. One kept running off the road at 70mph. Sheesh. 
   
     But at the same time for this tech to be fully realized we do need something along the lines of glasses. 
   
    From a long term POV we need something like AR glasses to enjoy this tech fully. But, the egg has just hatching so too speak so we will have to do the best with what he have for now until we get the chicken. 
    
    From a short term POV we know this thing has made several of us some money and still has some gas left in the tank. 

    But.... I never assumed this would take off and fly straight up without ever looking down. One reason is the OTC doesn’t function that way with hot stocks and for two, are the reasons the FB poster listed above.

     It has always been my position to make a nice profit, bail out completely or partially, depending on how things are playing out and then. Take a long position on free shares. I do see long term value here. But I’ll likely only hold 15-20% of my original holdings long term while I take my earnings and find more TTCM’s out there. 

     The reasons the FB poster and our very own OP  listed are good reasons to think this way. Thanks for your honesty OP. Good luck to the rest of y’all.",2019-07-21

15,GreenStonks,euehclt,/r/pennystocks/comments/cg0xfn/ttcm_concern_posited_to_david_lamountain/euehclt/,1,"Lets think about it like this:

Augmented reality is in its infancy. It still has a long way to go. This app will take advantage of the mobile app market which will itself be a fad they were loose steam just like pokemon go at some point. 

The real value in ARk is that it can be reprogrammed and used in a multitude of ways. Architects and city planners can use a VR headset to look around at a virtual property and visualize several designs in one day. Same for home buyers. Further more, it can play a great role in dashboards where driving and seeing virtual signs may be easier for the state to do than getting actual crews out to locations. I mean to say, if there is a pot hole that has just been reported, there can be a graphic visualized on the dashboard of your car that makes it more apparent. 

I think Augmented reality has a very long way to go but its still taking its baby steps now. Try to think of the big picture. Are you a day trader or long term investor? Its up to you how you decide to play this one and i think if we were to hear more about the company on local news stations, that would help give the company and its stock price credibility and attention.",2019-07-21
16,Anarkrist,eueimar,/r/pennystocks/comments/cg0xfn/ttcm_concern_posited_to_david_lamountain/eueimar/,1,"A portion of your portfolio reserved for multiple entries and exits of a particular stock at varying levels IN ADDITION to a core position, which is the portion of your portfolio dedicated to remain invested in in the same stock for a longer amount of time.

Any profits culled will come from this side position, and may or may not be reinvested (all or in part) on a dip. It is a way to mitigate losses and, perhaps, add shares while keeping a long position, especially if the upward trend is confirmed and more catalysts remain on the horizon. 

Example: I sold 300,000 shares of TTCM at .023 (without touching my initial shares) and bought back in at .0209. I will evaluate the action Monday, and play the side position accordingly.",2019-07-21

18,Spidey5909,eueox8x,/r/pennystocks/comments/cg1oga/pixy/eueox8x/,1,"hey this company has my attention! it’s like an uber app for the workplace! but as appealing as it sounds it is probably the riskiest stock i have ever seen being as it is one of a kind and something that has never been tried before... as much as i like the idea i Can’t see this putting an end to temp agencies and in my opinion small businesses and your average joe blow 2 man construction company will abuse this app and drive the workers away from using this app as a source for employment... at the same time, majority of the jobs will probably suck and giving people the freedom to work one day and then move on to the next available job the next day will not work.. with temp agencies you can’t quit your shitty assigned job and find a new job for the next morning, which in turn keeps people showing up to the next shift.. giving people the freedom to work new jobs daily will fail... keep in mind that this is just first thoughts about the company that i did not know existed until 10 minutes ago..  i will continue to read into them and even tho extremely risky, i will most likely buy 1000 shares tomorrow morning because if this company succeeds they will be huge! 

one question tho, i noticed the ipo was in the $7-$10 range and the s/p is now at $0.60... kind of looks like a failed start up and an impossible recovery.. could you brief me on what made the s/p fall so steeply in such a short period?",2019-07-21
