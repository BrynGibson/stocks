34,timlav,e59c133,/r/pennystocks/comments/9c85w5/anybody_buying_up_hmny_now_that_it_looks_like_it/e59c133/,1,"The biggest problem with Moviepass is that it has had to go through startup growth too quickly and very publicly because it‚Äôs on the NASDAQ.  Most startups using VC have time to figure out how to scale and generate stable revenue through multiple funding rounds with a small number of investors and/or funds. 

HMNY‚Äôs role in MP‚Äôs growth is similar to a public hedge fund. In this case, the fund bought such a high stake in the startup that the fortunes of both companies became one, essentially. So things like rapid growth and cash burn hit the public balance sheet. Retail and institutional investors freaked and sold. Some bought in a panic to average down making it worse. The harshest effect is caused by the dilution. HMNY can sell up to 5 billion shares of the company if it wants. Some estimates say that 1 billion shares are now outstanding. 

Dilution was a necessary evil to generate revenue until they get the cash burn rate down. It‚Äôs better than the short-term loan option. If this were a private funding scenario, the VCs could decide whether to add more funds, therefore also diluting other investors. The difference is that with private funding there‚Äôs no legal obligation to publicly report any of it. 

Even at 2 cents this is a risky stock. As one other commenter mentioned, day traders are speculating big time over tenths and hundredths of a penny (even less for anyone who has held since before the reverse split).

Over the past month, HMNY has made changes to its pricing to stabilize its cash burn rate. Users report the changes are ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to make them drop the service. 

Subscriber-based businesses can be very tricky, but also very lucrative for revenue streams outside the user base. MP made this a part of the business model too soon and too publicly. It has proved very nearly fatal. But there‚Äôs still a pulse. 

Time will tell if they‚Äôve found the sweet spot on pricing, sub growth, and data-selling to become ‚Äúthe next Netflix‚Äù. My guess is that is far off in the distance, if it is likely at all. 

Their first goal should be to get the stock price back to a dime, then to a buck, etc. But who knows, they might be bought by then. 

Anyone buying this company‚Äôs stock now is taking a huge risk, even if they‚Äôre investing less than $1,000. There‚Äôs no knowing when or if it will go up, but if it does, it‚Äôs not going to shoot up like it did last year unless there‚Äôs some really big news like a buyout. 

As always: I‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs financial advisor. Statements here are made for information purposes only and do not serve as investment advice. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee. 

Disclosure: I hold a long position on HMNY on the off chance I‚Äôll make my money back, but I doubt I will. ",2018-09-02
