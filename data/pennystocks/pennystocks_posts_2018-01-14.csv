Since they opened back up to the market on Jan 3rd, they have seen a 147% increase in value, and continues to rise daily.

5,"Txtm, don’t play otc based on charts",7qb0lu,Budd0413,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7qb0lu/txtm_dont_play_otc_based_on_charts/,9,4,"I never use technicals or charting to play otc stocks as they generally play on other less scientific factors.....

In the case of txtm, even though we are waiting for news and it could literally come anytime,  no reason to believe that it’s not coming,..... the chart looks great,  there have been several weeks of real accumulation and a new base has been formed at .0013,  the chart is ready to fly,  on this one I’d say all incoming news aside,  the chart has been setting up for a real technical run.  If there does happen to be news it would not surprise me to see a new 52 week high,  this hit .0056 early last year on all hype,  looks like that hype is now very close to a reality,  

Anyhow that is just my opinion,  but I think it’s worth a look to anyone interested.   ",2018-01-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7qb0lu/txtm_dont_play_otc_based_on_charts/
