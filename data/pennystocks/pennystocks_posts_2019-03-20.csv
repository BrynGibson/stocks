LAS VEGAS, NV, March 20, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- United Rail, Inc. (OTCPK: URAL), a short line railroad consolidator and owner of the SmartRail brand for electronic Precision Railroading and brand licensor, today announced that it has acquired the X Wine Railroad excursion train from Las Vegas Xpress Inc. for $500,000.  


The X Wine Railroad [www.winerailroad.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vAfw3_oXV-79MRj_fHPfsD_mR7AnUPJQxEzfHArd8X15623XgfGGPlqzaKrv0KR0LJ8s9u2mzEvqg627Cd4SFm-rRIpLz2SEN6nJ_l9-ZYU=) is a service between Los Angeles and the wine country of Santa Barbara and Los Olivos, California. The service began in January 2017 and is the first of its kind to transport passengers from Los Angeles by rail aboard elegantly restored rail cars to visit the unique wine country of Los Olivos in the Santa Ynez valley.

The X Wine Railroad, as the service is called, introduces travelers to the wine country of Southern California via rail. Passengers board at Union Station in Los Angeles and travel by train to Santa Barbara. There they are escorted by luxury tour vehicles to the Los Olivos region of the Santa Ynez Valley, home of some 200 wineries in the region. Travelers spend several hours on a variety of tour activities such as winery tours and tastings, the Old Town Los Olivos wine crawl or just taking in the sights of this magnificent wine lovers’ destination.

“The X Wine Railroad project has been a great hit with the public since we began operations,” stated CEO Michael Barron.  “It is a fantastic tour and it gives our staff solid operational experience aboard a train in preparation of our expanding excursion service into other markets.”

Dianne David, President of the Passenger Rail Subsidiary of United Rail, Inc., added, “The wine/rail industry is a budding market in the rail excursion business.  Our service is quite unique -- a private tour of wineries and wine products for the true wine aficionado.”

The service is all inclusive and includes luxury train tickets, a breakfast and dinner service, wine tasting on board, excursion to Los Olivos, brunch at the vineyards and special gifts for riders. The service is primarily marketed to group planners, corporations and special parties. Prices are customized to the group requirements.",2019-03-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b3fh5v/ural_united_rail_inc_acquires_x_wine_railroad/

PR Newswire

BENTONVILLE, Ark., March 19, 2019

BENTONVILLE, Ark., March 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- New sales statistics show GLUCODOWN®, manufactured by Glucose Health, Inc. (OTC: GLUC) (""Company""), is benefiting from increasing consumer awareness, early in 2019. Sales of GLUCODOWN® at Walmart pharmacies are up 27% for the first seven weeks of 2019 vs. the first seven weeks of 2018. Even more impressive is the 27% sales increase in 2019 is measured against a Walmart price ""Rollback"" in the same period of 2018 (which began the liquidation of the first generation of GLUCODOWN®).  Glucose Health, Inc. expects Walmart sales of GLUCODOWN® to continue to increase for the balance fiscal 2019 and additionally, to expand distribution to new national and/or large regional drug store chains.

Amazon sales of GLUCODOWN®, which launched in the third quarter of 2018, are also achieving impressive results. GLUCODOWN® Raspberry earned the status of an ""Amazon No. 1 New Product Release"" – and not only for the diabetic iced tea category – but an ""Amazon No. 1 New Product Release"" for the entire iced tea category encompassing bottled diabetic, diet and regular sugared iced teas. The Company will provide the latest statistics related to online sales performance on Amazon, next Tuesday, March 22.

Growing Amazon sales are being driven in part, by the newly produced GLUCODOWN® TV commercial, ""Available on Amazon,"" now airing on Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries and Game Show Network.  Viewers of the TV commercial are directed to purchase GLUCODOWN® at a dedicated web domain and storefront ([www.amazon.com/glucodown](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2407037-1&amp;h=225219220&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fglucodown&amp;a=www.amazon.com%2Fglucodown)) provided by Amazon for GLUCODOWN®. In order for GLUCODOWN® to qualify for this dedicated web domain and storefront, the Company was required to provide the Amazon Brand Registry with a United States Patent and Trade Office (""USPTO"") principal register trademark. Following  nearly a year of review, Glucose Health, Inc. was recently awarded the highest level of protection from the USPTO, with registration of the trademark ""GLUCODOWN®"" on the principal register (Reg. # 5572054).  

Glucose Health, Inc. also continues to benefit from its key supplier relationship with Archer Daniels Midland (""ADM""). Last week, Glucose Health, Inc. confirmed the Food and Drug Administration's acceptance of the clinical research prepared by ADM, supporting the efficacy of the soluble dietary fiber in GLUCODOWN®; which included clinical data related to glucose metabolism and digestive health.  GLUCODOWN® is the first powdered tea mix ever to be successfully enriched with this FDA recognized1 form of soluble dietary fiber.",2019-03-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b3e5k8/gluc_walmart_glucodown_sales_increase_27_ytd/
