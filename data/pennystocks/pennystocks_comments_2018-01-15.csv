57,WarrenPuff_It,dsquvxb,/r/pennystocks/comments/7qmwkz/long_term_penny_stock_trading/dsquvxb/,2,"Timing the regular markets is hard enough, with pennies there is a reason they have such a shitty share price, the companies are absolute shit and usually that derives from a board of crooks/bad business people who run their business by endlessly dumping shares on the float. Sure, some of them, a fraction of them, are legit businesses with future potential, but the vast majority are terribly run and their share price reflects that reality. If you want to baghold endlessly, you can, but your chances of doing successful swing trades in pennies over any prolonged period of time is infinitely smaller than if you were to do it successfully with different asset classes. I'm not saying you can't, there is nothing stopping you from trying, I'm just trying to save you from unrealized losses that you haven't started yet. Pennies mostly go down over time, fact of life. 

Their are people who play pennies professionally, but keep in mind that two of the most famous people to do so in the modern era was a monolithic ""pump and dump"" tycoon who was so successful they had to change how OTCs were traded, and a college kid from NY that made a name for himself shorting dotcom penny stocks in the aftermath of the bubble. That's a scam artist famous for orchestrating a massive pennystock scheme, and an amateur-bear who got caught the right side of a retail-level pricing discrepancy during a historic bubble? Both geniuses in their own right for how they exploited loopholes to con people like you and I, but also it should be noted that the con artist went to jail and died shortly after being released, and the NY savant blew up his account in 2008 because he was a one-trick pony, since then he's made money off selling coaching videos and email alerts... Sound familiar? Front-loaded tickers he then gives to a pool of people to buy in at the open.

For today, I got into DTST, hoping to turn that around for a quick $100 or so.

I need ENSV to move up a bit, DNAD, MGXMF, ARGS, and OHRP are longer term plays. I'm basically even on those ones, hoping they go up this month.",2018-01-15
