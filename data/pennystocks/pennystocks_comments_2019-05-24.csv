2,ApolloMac,eokmjeu,/r/pennystocks/comments/bsa5oh/a_few_question_about_my_companies_stock/eokmjeu/,1,"If there is a buy out because the company is faltering, it will be based on the current valuation, which in theory should equal the market cap of the stock. The reverse split won't have any effect on the possible purchase price the value of the company currently is the only thing that matters.

Many times buy outs do bring investors some gains. Meaning the shares are purchased by the new company for a bit more than they are worth on the open market. But this is negotiated by the executives or board, and usually when a smaller company is doing great so a larger competitor buys them out. If the company is failing and the only other option is bankruptcy, they don't have a great negotiating position.",2019-05-24

4,Tricombed,eoknbum,/r/pennystocks/comments/bsa5oh/a_few_question_about_my_companies_stock/eoknbum/,1,"Not sure if this covers what you are asking.

&amp;#x200B;

If you buy 100 shares of your company at $2 and they get bought out by Verizon with a stock price of $50, you would get the value of your shares in Verizon stock. Your shares are worth $200 ($2/share \* 100 shares = $200). You would receive $200 worth of Verizon shares. This means you would get 4 shares of Verizon stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

When a company reverse splits, your share count is reduced and the share price goes up. You keep the same amount of $ value. It is typical for a company that is failing to have their share price drop after a reverse split, because investors are looking to sell their stake in a failing company.

&amp;#x200B;

From there your company can start to dilute by offering more shares, let it drop and do another reverse split, let it drop and do nothing, or any combination of the three. All will reduce the $ value of your stake in the company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope some of that helps.",2019-05-24

When publically traded companies get bought out, the purchasing company often pays an ""acquisition premium"". If this is the case, and you hold a $2 share in company XYZ when they get bought out by Verizon, then your stock in XYZ will turn into $2 worth of Verizon stock, plus the premium (80 cents if the premium is 40%). Note, some companies get bought with no premium and others get bought on discount, which is the opposite of a premium.
