No official word on what that company is and no official filings yet, so take that at face value or leave it. There will probably be lots of hype and a bit of a buying frenzy on Monday but I think without more official news from the company it will die out by Tuesday or Wednesday.

9,IrRoscoeMr,ehorxyx,/r/pennystocks/comments/awq1vk/leas_talk_me_into_it/ehorxyx/,1,"LEAS before February.. super shady. (See MMTE). 

CEO went to prison.

Delisted due to unpaid taxes. 2016ish?

They only had a set amount of time to comeback and repay taxes to be reinstated. (I believe it would have ended in April)

New CEO hired. Specializes in mergers. IR company seems legit. Both seem to have no history of shady shit. Market cap 3m and shares 800m with inside holding. No shorts. 

We have confirmation from CEO that they are fully funded for merger. They have a highly responsive IR and CEO addressing shit they don't have to (bots on twitter). They have confirmation of revenues from merging company $10m and $50m assets plus the $3m assets for LEAS puts it at a dime valuation and we found out they deal with real estate leasing and luxury vehicles. 

I have 50% of my investment in LEAS. I don't know what risk you're willing to take because everything here is a gamble. It depends what you want to compare it to. I compared it to SHMP and VYST and felt comfortable with the risk. News comes out price goes high. People get tired of waiting to see actual fundamentals and harvest profits and it dips until more news. I believe if you get in before .005 you will not have to worry about losing money during that dip and watching red waiting on news. You may even be able to sell half and sit worry free. Also, the company is quick on twitter so that's just what you're up against, the FOMO is going to be real.

I can't gaurantee you and I'm not shitty enough of a person to try.

If(and I hate using that word) it continues I do believe.01 cent is reachable. I just don’t risk money on such thin ice. 
A better way is to day trade or swing trade no more than 100-500$ . Almost every morning the stock sells off a little than recovers . Buy at the bottom sell when you have 20 percent profit. As long as it’s pushing 20 million in volume this is possible.
Say over time it does make.01 C . If you day traded it or swing traded on the way up you made just as much without the risk of it falling out of the sky

I have a cash account the PDT rule doesn’t apply 
I keep 3 times the amount I want to trade with I the account. Trade money on Monday is freed up for Thursday ( unsettled funds rules)
Another way is to have multiple brokers with two times the amount you wish to day trade with. Alternate brokers daily 
If you have a very small account say 100 $.  Even if you just traded twice a week and swung it when there was news you would come out ahead 
I traded KRFG Friday. Thursday it had news I dropped 100$ at .0029 could have sold at .004 ( should have)
The next morning it opened and fell to .004. I bought 500$ ( when buying that much you need to sell while it is still going up)sold at .0055 )sold the 100$at .006

The average around the country for farmed shrimp is $20 US per pound. Thus about $80k. I've also read of other farmers that if all goes well,  expect about 50% profit.  

SHMP likes to hype themselves but they need to release their harvest data...what has been their loss up to the ""harvest date"". I quoted the harvest date because all I've seen so far were a few boxes delivered to a country club. The rest are still in the tanks. 

I've read up on a dozen indoor growing operations around the country that are very good at releasing their harvest data.  SHMP lags behind. They need a better public relations person other than the chef who only talks about the flavor. Tell us the capacity of your system.  Are their plans for smaller scale operations and larger operations? Is there an estimate for the sale of this system.  What's the cost to run with this system.  Will filters need to be changed often and are they a proprietary filter. .. or are they self cleaning by back-flushing? 

From what I've read is their system is a clear/clean water system. Darn close to a sterile process,  vs the bioflock system all other farmers use and are harvesting near 90%.
