100,Madmanmadox02,duz3710,/r/pennystocks/comments/80wu5y/antibe_therapeutics/duz3710/,1,"Video (to watch first): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_3heP7ol0A

After watching the video, back in the fall, I decided to buy into this company. I feel the current value is undervalued.

The learning experience of the first phase led to a sell off and the stock still has not recovered enough going into this phase... especially with results fairly close on the horizon. I fully expect this stock to run up to 60+ cents before the results and $2+ after.

The odds of a successful trail are understated in the existing market price of 20 cents. Both people who had the adverse effects had hepatitis... the dose that the adverse reaction was also 750mg *2 a day... Ultimately hep played a factor but this was likely amplified by the unforeseen longetivity of the drug (long halflife), the drug also had a stronger effect on pain then anticipated so the dosage could reasonably be reduced and still have desired effect and be safer to the GI.

The current trail is only using 250mg once per day at a max (my understanding is they are testing low dosages this phase). This is a far different from the 750mg twice daily where the adverse effects were showing in the two people with hep (and other ailments).

If you were to say 50/50 odds; if fail go to 2 cents and if succeed go to 2$ then the estimated share price could be (0.5*.02 +0.5*$2) =$1.01. I believe the trail will be positive as I feel this dosage almost ensures it so... therefore I feel its likely 10/90 therein estimated value could be (0.10*.02 + (0.9*2) = $1.81. I feel the $2 share price is likely more of a place for a debate than the 90% change of successful and safer results.Ultimately there is also a risk of selling the drug at a good price... but given the market its in and the ability to outperform Neproxin... the current buy in price more than compensates this risk.

These opinions are my own. Please keep in mind your risk apptitude before you take exposure with regards to a binary drug play.

My recommendations are: 

Banking: Lloyds mostly focused on us and uk so Brexit wouldn't impact as much as other banks and has been around for 250yrs plus a good dividend yield its only 68p get it for a long term investment you could trade every couple of days if you have a lot but keep it mostly for the dividend and very potential of going up to £3 again even more",2018-02-28
