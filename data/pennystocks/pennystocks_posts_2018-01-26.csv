It's got 20 million shares and a market cap of something like 20 million.  This company owns the 2nd largest collection of uranium mines in the united states, and has its own permitted mill, and one of the lowest costs of production in the industry.  The only problem is that uranium prices are extremely low right now, $23.  However, they have a large vanadium deposit, and vanadium prices are up something like $11 a pound from 1 or 2 when the properties were purchased.

At this point, small purchases of 5k or less move this stock 5 or 10% in a day.  It's EXTREMELY thinly traded, despite being the 2nd largest uranium company in the united states.  

all it's projects are permitted, and it's basically ready to go into production at the right uranium and vanadium prices.

I'm down 50%, I fucked up and bought at the peak a month ago - and it immediately dropped 20% in one day, I have then watched it drop another 30%.  It's painful to watch, to be honest.  I've never made such a bad mistake before in investing in regards to the speed of the price drop.  I invested way too much instead of averaging down.

What do you folks think about this company?  I'd LOVE to buy at these prices, it's a fucking steal IMO.  I'm somewhat considering doubling down, but I'm already pretty heavily invested so I'm hesitant.
