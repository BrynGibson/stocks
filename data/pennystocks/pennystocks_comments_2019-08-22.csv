I don't look for winners, nor do I look for losers; I look for good trades. Let me explain, lets say your mindset is about avoiding losers.

It creates a scared mindset in my opinion, thus it's not as effective. When you make a trade, you should have no doubt behind why that trade did/didn't work. What remains the same is the execution. I remember for the longest time thinking ""I got it,"" but never having any proof while getting a loss every now and then, until after a 3 month green streak was I able to believe ""This time, I know what I'm looking for.""

It different for everyone and their chosen market/niche. I personally screen-record my trades, drink a beer, and watch back the tape for hours. Imagine when you first started out driving a car. You had to consciously think about everything; the peddle, the blinkers, the wheel, where to look, etc etc. Overtime though, these conscious patterns seem to be ""automatic,"" as if you already know what to do. There is no doubt, and if there is, it's a no-go on the trade. If I trade with high confidence, and it fails, I missed something. Simple. Pick your own trades to pieces.

The strategy you're presenting isn't so much as a strategy as much as random guessing.  You can't know \*why\* a stock is rising, you can only guess. It's important that the guess be made out of strategic reasoning, rather than a confirmation of something you've already concluded.",2019-08-22

IT'S ABOUT THE TRADE. THE TRADE. Somehow jam this into your head. It's not about money. The money will come if you make a good trade. Look back at your charts and think ""damn that was a good trade"" rather than ""damn I made so much money on that trade.""

Hey folks,

I usually lurk the forums and occasionally post my due diligence which predicates on analyzing both fundamentals and technicals for stocks, as well as critiquing stocks posted here in efforts to advocate and/or educate potential traders/investors on the risks and rewards respectively.

My former call-outs for $HSGX doing merger arbitrage based on the previous filings allowed for gains over 100% within short time-spans, and can be found scrolling back in the history here on [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/)

That said, I'll get to the meat and potatoes of the post..

Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. is a maritime shipping company with 10 Capesize vessels in their fleet, which is set-up for a nice run both on fundamentals and also due to momentum given their market cap (\~$15.1m,) and low public float (\~14m shares public, \~24.5m overall shares.) This makes liquidity less ideal for day-trading without above average volume, thus making it higher risk, but much higher reward.

Shipping prices for maritime fleets have hit multi-year highs. This is due to the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI,) and Baltic Dry Index (BDI,) hitting multi-year highs which serves as the price index for maritime shipping companies.

The Iron Ore demand is also up again due to Vale companies Brumadinho mine coming back online which impacts $SHIP particularly given that is one of their primary transports.

Per the CEO in their recent 6-K filing he has clarified the boost in revenue for Q3 will be substantial due to these factors by stating; ‚ÄúSince the beginning of the third quarter of 2019, 62% of our fleet available days have been fixed at a daily TCE of approximately $23,800 per ship per day, marking an increase of 184% as compared to the fleet average TCE rate of $8,368 in the first half of 2019.‚Äù

Another key factor is also the demand being higher than usual as many fleets are having ships out-of-service while getting fuel scrubbers installed to meet emissions requirements for the IMO 2020 standard which takes effect January 1st, 2020. This is why I foresee this trend holding through Q3 and most of Q4.

 I intend to carry most of my shares into Q3 Earnings and likely Q4 Earnings. The major deciding factor for speculation beyond that will be reliant on the BCI/BDI shipping rates hold near the multi-year highs, as well as factoring in for the companies ability to lock-in the pricing per their contracts with the charterer's who are utilizing $SHIP's vessels.

Best of luck to all those investing here or with other companies.",2019-08-22
