This may seem like a really basic question -and I admit, Iâ€™m a total noob- but how do I get started trading? Iâ€™ve wanted to start trading for years, I first got interested when a guy I knew got really really good at it.

11,Thoughts on GEL?,8zbk5z,RideStride,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8zbk5z/thoughts_on_gel/,1,0,"Hi, I'm new to investing and started experimenting with stocks recently. I've been looking into a few penny stocks and accidentally found Tangelo games, listed as GEL.

It's a Canadian gaming company that touts itself as the only publicly traded social casino gaming company, which I find interesting.  It has quite a wealth of games, which seem at least partially only big in Latin countries. That being said, a company like this could possibly be in the position of one day developing at least one good mainstream hit at some point due to its game output. It seems to have been trading since 2012 with a high of 60 cents per share before rapidly declining and it releases quarterly reports. However, the other day it's stock was only a single penny for a while, but then jumped up to 2.5 cents recently.

I'm new to investing and penny stocks, so I'm wondering what you guys think about Tangelo. Do you think it's worth investing in? Do you think its bubble popped already? Would like your thoughts in analyzing a stock like this and what to consider in a penny stock.",2018-07-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8zbk5z/thoughts_on_gel/
