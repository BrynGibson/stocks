Its like someone saying that they know smoking is bad, drugs is bad, but they know what they are dealing with. When in reality, the consequences are so much more dire than they are leading on.

There is a difference between speculating on a penny stock that you see has a product that can disrupt current trends and potentially be a huge player down the line.

Then there are sub 10m market cap penny stocks trading below 0.01, where the volume can be manipulated to the high heavens and you are literally gambling. Whats the point of doing any due diligence on these companies when the time horizion you hold them is probably not long enough for anything to materialize. You are literally trading pumps and dumps, and this game very few in the world are successful. If you are one of the few, then you are likely a full time trader already. You don't need to be trading penny stocks, you can trade larger stocks and get a consistent EV over the long term without having to dealing with the manipulation that penny stocks have.",2018-07-21

Some people can trade the otc successfully and some can not.  That’s not a slam , but to say these are pump and dumps solely because they have less than 10 mil market cap is just plain wrong.   EMPM , SGTN for example all trade cleanly, no dilution no crazy front load,  they are companies that are taking the correct steps to grow and succeed.  BIOAQ is a Q stock, that is going to be acquired because regardless of their past poor management have IP and an up and running facility second to none.   I’m not just calling out any random otc garbage, these are companies I believe have tremendous upside in the short term based on material events.   Not being interested in a trade because of market cap is like saying you wouldn’t buy from a    Mom and Pop sandwich shop because they don’t have the size and presence of McDonalds.   

Anyhow I appreciate your comment and understand where you are coming from.... I make a lot of trades that’s true, not to say I don’t see great investment in my  long MU from 18.00 and 23.00, or AMD at 10.50, but microcap otc companies that are not pump and dumps do exist and provide great trades if you do your homework.   

I’ve made some poor trades in the otc and there are 10 bad companies to one good one, that’s why when the good ones come around I like to at least give people the opportunity to make an informed decision.   I’m not pumping, I’m actually buying these, and if you add them to your watch list I think you’ll be surprised. ",2018-07-21

Antibe holdings has somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 million shares. Wallace himself has around 500k plus 7M options, CEO Dan legault has around 700k shares IIRC and roughly 7M options as well. 

Wallace has spent the better part of 30 years working towards this drug and it essentially is the only thing he will leave as his legacy. He is the #1 cited and published inflammation expert in the world and does it not for the money but for the love of science and mankind. He is exactly the reason I went all in on ATE and have roughly 250k shares.

Was it because of the additional shares issuances at $0.385? I am thinking the near term catalyst for the stock is the phase 2 dose ranging study that should be out within the next 2-3 months, so I am abit suprised at this selloff with a catalyst coming up so quickly.

Sorry if I come off as a little uninformed (correct me if I am wrong) but as far as potential partnerships for small biotech companies, don't they usually happen after phase 3? But it seems like they are saying in alot of their presentations/financials that they are looking at potential partnerships already. I did some research myself and found that after  phase 3, the companies then file the NDA with the FDA. Phase 3 can take anywhere from 1-4 years.",2018-07-21
12,PerfectRectangle,e2t0h67,/r/pennystocks/comments/90t4dw/antibe_therapeutics/e2t0h67/,4,"They issued very little shares, so no I don't think so.

Looks like in the last week there were 800k warrants redeemed. ATE has been floating around the long term support of 375ish for a while now. I'm guessing that since there was a huge support wall at 36 and 365 and 37, someone with hundreds of K warrants dumped on the walls to redeem and get cash for other pursuits or to reno their house or to do a bunch of coke or whatever... whatever someone needs money for who knows. There were 2 houses that took out the support this week and just those 2 sellers. As soon as it hit 355 it seemed like a bunch of stops were getting hit as I watched L2 trades come and go. Then probably a bunch of people saw it dropping and panicked and sold, so on and so forth. The volume going down was very low... about 400k shares only took us from 35 to 31 then penny flippers churned it up and down a few cents. Unfortunate that with summer the volume and bids were so thin because it dropped so quick. If I had dumped my holdings I could have taken it down to 24c at one time as well... just the results of low volume kinda fuckin up the ticker.

That being said, there's about 100k on the ask from current point back to the 38 support. It seems like no one wants to be selling down here, it's just churning a bit as people flip for a few hundred bucks for pennies. 


As for the trial, small biotechs never do phase 3 alone, they always sell after phase 2 trials. Phase 3 costs a good 40M and very little if any small companies have that. Mgmt has said numerous times as soon as phase 2 is done they will be either selling rights to atb346 or looking to sell their whole company, based on the offer. So there is a large payday coming for sure in the immediacy following the next trial results.",2018-07-21

I am playing this one for the long haul, I personally don't know as much or own as much as PerfectRectangle or some of the redditors that have been talking about this stock for a while now. I just wanted to get some more experienced minds on my concerns that I had with the company. 

With that in mind, my opinion is that if they are successful in the upcoming trial or selling the rights, there should be substantial increase from the current share price. This is a pretty binary play that hinges on execution of the trial as well as getting partnerships for their drug. If they are able to do that, I don't think I would sell. Selling the rights usually involves a royalty of some sort, so its not as if they sold it and have nothing in their belt. There is a lot more upside to be had with other pipeline drugs that are similar to ATB346 and revolve around Hydrogen Sulfide.",2018-07-21

At a PE of only 10 that's 1.2B market cap which is over $4/share at fully diluted 260M. PE of 20 gives us over $8/share. Easy to play around with the numbers and see how things could evolve over 10 years of patent life with 4 compounds they have going currently. ",2018-07-21
