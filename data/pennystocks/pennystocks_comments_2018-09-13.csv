They already had two institutional shareholders, one of which recently doubled their holdings or added 50% of their holdings, I forget. Unheard of for a pinky. Once they uplist to the OTCQB, I think it will be a major boon for shareholders as more institutions will add.",2018-09-13

8,Utonate,e5x0l2z,/r/pennystocks/comments/9fiv35/under_the_radar_canadian_company_beer_hill_street/e5x0l2z/,1,"I like the space. They have outlets already established and have won the #1 tasting non alcoholic wine and beer beverages. They are teamed with MADD. They have just locked their cannabis infusion suppliers, who are working to complete a cannabis-tasteless alcohol free beverage with HIll Street. I can easily see them being the favorable pick for large chain suppliers ie: Canadian LCBO - as they are a well managed and an established company. Legalization is around the corner. I think this is a good long-term investment. Never know, could be the Aphria of cannabis-infused beverages. They were once under $1.00.

Amfil doesn't do anything except acquire and ""streamline"" companies' operations, but they've only acquired 2 companies. Their financials are trash and you also need to look at the Auditor's Note in the financial statements:

""The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements do not purport to represent realizable
or settlement values. The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $2.7
million at June 30, 2017.

The Company intends to meet its working capital requirements from the issuance of common shares and convertible
promissory notes as well as short term related party loans and income from operations. However, there can be no assurance
that such financial support shall be ongoing or available on terms or conditions acceptable to the Company. This raises
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts,
discontinuance of operations is possible. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to obtain additional financing and to generate profits and positive cash flow.""
