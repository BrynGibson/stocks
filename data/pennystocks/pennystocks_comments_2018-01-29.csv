I really enjoyed it today and planned on putting in $10 a paycheck for a year to just play around with and see how well I do.  Figured I could assess if I wanted to put more in after my first year.  I was thinking about research every other day and maybe buying stocks that I think will rebound right before the market closes daily.  Then selling the next day once I get to my %gain goal.

IMUN has exclusivity for Lodonal TM throughout Africa. A high percentage of Africans with HIV / AIDS are untreated. Lodonal is very cheap because it is off label. The higher dose form, Nalrexone 50mg, was FDA approved back in the 70's / 80's and was a drug with DuPont. It was ineffective for what it was approved for, treating heroine and alcohol dependence. It became generic, but Dr. Bihari, who passed away in 2010, did research and found it to be highly effective in the low dose form 4.5mg. It was highly effective in the Nigerian clinical trials for treating HIV. Read up on it, the IBOX on IHub has most of the DD you should read up on, and you can ask questions on that board. I am a moderator on that board, dwarren428, but am currently in the Jailhouse for a few more days. 
To answer your question, it's an untapped market. Potential sales are enormous. 
Why haven't the big boys taken up this low dose naltrexone??? Big pharma doesn't want low dose naltrexone to have success because it is cheaper and they fear it will be more effective than their more expensive drugs. All my opinion. Read up on it. Big pharma is happy dragging this thing out for as long as they can, and that is what has taken it so long. IMUN also owns around a 10% stake in Cytocom, which will get Lodonal sales in United States if they are able to pass a phase 2b and phase 3. They have already passed trials in Nigeria, and received marketing approval, but are still awaiting final approvals from NASCOP (Kenya) and NACA (Nigeria). IMUN's Lodonal was already approved by NAFDAC in 2016.
The drug is the real deal. The expected sales are very high in my opinion. Read all the recent filings. It has been held down by a toxic debtor (see Nov 2nd 8-k), and other manipulations in the past. ",2018-01-29
