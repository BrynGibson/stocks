122,ArmoredDragonIMO,dvaeiqq,/r/pennystocks/comments/82cyhh/have_you_guys_seen_the_jbzy_crash_and_burn_lately/dvaeiqq/,1,"Well first I need to add a disclaimer that I am not a seasoned investor. My day job is a network engineer, and I only began my 401k about 18 months ago. After I saw it grow, then I pulled about 10k from my savings to see if I can make it grow too. It did so, and while I recovered from a recent kidney transplant, I put in another 50k and really got into it. Mostly learned by trial and error, and I tend to learn stuff fast. It also helps that I took economics and accounting in college, and that I regularly debate communists on why communism fails from a purely economic perspective so as to strengthen that knowledge.

As for where I get my info, it's mostly by watching press releases, and verifying their claims. That, plus Google and YouTube. I can offer a few rules I built for myself as well, but given my limited experience, take them with a grain of salt:

1 NEVER chase a stock either up or down when buying; stick to the support line (or slightly below it) and remove all emotional decisions about whether you'd lose or gain money by buying or not buying. Set a limit price and trust yourself that you'll get it. If you miss it and it grew ahead of you, that's ok, just watch for another support line and buy then.
2 Avoid buying right after a surge in volume... Let it cool off for a day.
3 Do place a limit order below the last close before the trading day begins, even if it puts you below the support line.
4 Make sure the company has more than one of these, or just one very strong one:
 A: A business model likely to drive growth, such as carving a strong niche, disrupting the market, creating a new market, doesn't rely on incentives for customers selling to other customers for sales (their product should sell itself,) doesn't rely entirely on ad revenue (it's just a crapshoot for micro-caps), doesn't rely on news buzzwords not relevant to its core business (i.e. tea companies and blockchain.) Be highly critical here.
 B: Strong indication(s) of existing growth, (NOT stock price; small growth will do) whether that's in the form expanding their business, bringing in a profit, and/or buying assets that aren't equipment or real estate (IP is good, other companies is good.) The more of these, the better, and use your objective judgement, NOT your emotions.
 C: It's in an industry or market segment that is currently seeing growth.
 D: It's being run by somebody seasoned in that industry with a history of success. Practically all of them are on LinkedIn, so look them up, and look at their CV. Look up the company there too while you're at it.
5 You've seen Silicon Valley: Fraud is DEATH for an investor. Google the company and add terms like fraud, deception, lies, etc. Verify all findings from neutral sources. If the company ever made a false statement on a press release, SELL. If their deliverable looks too good to be true, SELL. If they don't fluently speak your language with flawless grammar in their press releases, SELL. If their published photographs focus more on people smiling than the product, and/or the product is just a render, SELL. It doesn't matter if the stock price is rising, it's just a scam. Also Google the company backers and c level executives, and add terms like fraud, lying, deception, etc. If just ONE has backed or run a company or project that was fraudulent, or over 50% of their publicly listed ones just failed, SELL. If any one of them is a known huckster, cheater, liar, etc, SELL.
6 If the company otherwise doesn't speak your native language, fraud is harder to spot, so just stay away from it, no matter how much word of mouth on the internet says otherwise (people are always going to speak good about what stocks they own.)
7 If the company doesn't publish quarterly reports that are at least partially audited, dock a few points on your reasons to buy list. If their debts are more than 30% if their assets, dock another point. Look at their income statement. If their net income (loss) keeps decreasing by big (relative) amounts each quarter, another point. Do give points if they are paying off debt and big points if they're a profitable micro-cap. There are others to look for as well, but you'd want to read an accounting book before going into it. There's not an exact number on this, but if p/e ratio is available, you want it as low as possible, trying to stay below 50, and ideally below 20.
8 Verify that the company's growth claims are accurate (i.e. rxmd really did submit a letter of intent to start a third pharmacy.) Also verify their existing claims as much as possible, because few people do so to begin with when it comes to micro caps. (I.e. use Google Street to verify any locations that they claim to down if they've had them for over two years, and look for indications that they have customers and/or employees, i.e cars parked in front.)
10 Most importantly: Ignore emotion. Let the math do the talking. Ignore pumpers unless they can offer specific reasoning for their opinion, and verify it. Pumping isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can screw with your emotions, thus tainting your decision, so be objective. A guy posted here promoting rxmd, and cited its sales growth as a reason. Many here dismissed him as a shill without taking a deeper look.
11. Use places like this as a means to find stocks to investigate further. LIGA's stock price growth caught my eye, but the fact that it's in a HIGHLY saturated industry, its claims were impressive but without any substance, and it's going to count on peer to per sales turned me away. Maybe I missed the deal of a lifetime? Who knows, but I think it's not work the risk, especially in light of essential phone.

Rules aside...

My investment strategy kind of resembles that of day traders, even though I'm not a day trader. I aim for a certain number of shares that I want, rather than a dollar amount, but prefer to stay under 10 cents per share, under a $1000 initial investment, and at or above 10,000 shares. I buy twice the number of shares that I intend to keep longer term. If the company passes my tests really well, I give it two weeks to double in price. If it still shows a strong price increase, I hold until it levels off for more than a day and sell enough stock so that my net cash investment is zero, meanwhile I still have plenty of shares. If it takes a longer to double, then I just sell half once it does, or if it takes longer than a month, then I just sell for the dollar amount that I put in. After this I set a 50% stop-loss and just see where it goes. I haven't yet bought a stock and had it suddenly fall, but if it did, I'd sell at the 50% Mark. $500 loss isn't a big deal, especially given my penny portfolio is about $5k (2k realized) above I started 2 months ago, and I never put more than 1k into penny stocks at any given time, and never holding more that three at a time (more just takes too much time and focus.) I might roll higher after a while, but I'm still new to the game.

If you don't like my rules or my strategy, great, just create one and stick with it, otherwise your emotions will get the better of you.",2018-03-06

It has already demonstrated great efficacy (it's literally naproxen with a chemical moiety stuck on it), but the phase 2B results will answer one of those questions, which is gastrointestinal safety.

The other question, as with all drugs, that often surface during phase 3 trials is unanticipated side effects (i.e. toxicities) with long-term exposure.

This is all my opinion and in no way advice for investing. Please, do whatever you want to do regardless of my thoughts on the matter. I thought about investing in ADVT but decided to put money elsewhere. It could run, but something about the company seemed off to me. 

The press releases and good news seem great, but there is no indication of volume being produced. Yeah they are expecting to triple Amster-can revenue in California, but from their quarterly statements in 2017 there isn't a lot of revenue to begin with. They could be legitimate or at least good for a run, but there are other companies out there that seem way more appealing to put money into.",2018-03-06
