18,StatusQuoBot,f8pxzto,/r/pennystocks/comments/e1h42j/admp_fda_unapproved_down_50/f8pxzto/,1,"This is disappointing. I'm on the fence for the moment - I'm tempted to go all in but for now I'm sitting on what I've got. Public health biotech is my area and I really think this should have been a slam dunk but I'm ... reluctantly holding off on buying any more for now.  

There are a TON of reasons this should be easy to fix. The FDA refusal doesn't sound that serious, at least as far as refusals go. It's not based upon concerns about safety or efficacy. It's mostly related to documentation about manufacturing which generally should be pretty straightforward for the company to resolve with minimal additional expense or time. It should be additional procedural or GMP documentation, possibly inspections. A few months delay, minimal additional cost. In the grand scheme of things this probably isn't THAT serious. 

The news release from Adamis was not encouraging though. I would expect more resolve in their response. Also the lack of clarity around the specific use of the word ""chemistry"" made it unclear whether this was simply a procedural hurdle that falls under the general umbrella of CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls) or whether the drug chemistry was specifically an issue of concern. They left open the possibility that the FDA is not convinced about the purity or identity of one of the ingredients. This seems unlikely but would be significantly more serious to fix. 

In all likelihood, I think this is a procedural fix, a few months and that this is a pretty solid plan for a company to take advantage of the small profit margin but very high demand for strategically selected generics. Their patents and licensing are solid, they are drawing upon approved technologies, using existing drugs and approved delivery devices They're sourcing from established compounders and facilities. I think they are good.  There really should not be any reason that this drug wouldn't make it through review. 

In addition, everything about this drug AND the company is timed well to align with high-priority directives that the FDA is seeking to support. The FDA needs higher dose Narcan, they've increased the recommended dosing multiple times in response to increasing number and strength of synthetics, and are likely to do it again when their advisory committee meets in a few weeks. The FDA specifically have stated that they want to prioritize generics, and they want MULTIPLE generics to foster competition and reduce drug price. If that's what the FDA want, it's Adamis' bread and butter. All of their pipeline products are competitors to drugs with new-but existing generics (Narcan, Advair, EpiPen).

THIS SHOULD BE A SLAM DUNK. The market is there, the tech is there, the IP protections strong (where they're needed), the public health need is there, There is clear strategic alignment with regulatory priotities and there aren't many competitors. 

But here's the catch; **The reason there aren't a bunch of companies beating down the door to compete with already-competing generics is that it's hard to stay afloat. There is a shit-ton of money required up-front to get past the FDA and the margin on the back end is razor thin**. They don't have enough coming in... and haven't for a long time. Best possible outcome leaves them vying for second place in a market that the current generic leader (Teva) gets $40 bucks a pop to dominate. YES, the demand is through the roof. That's the incentive to try in the first place and it's why I think their business model is sound, but it's also why they're still a penny stock with an otherwise solid set of candidates. They have to clear this stage. In the past, FDA refusals have caused them to walk away from drugs completely if the additional investment required didn't justify the profit. They have put everything into a few well-selected, very solid bets but none of them have paid off enough so far to maintain viability. 

They were really betting on this approval and without it, they're barely staying afloat. **Take a look at ADMP's 8k from September**. It did NOT look good. I'm not sure they have the money to handle the delay, even if they response requirements from the FDA are minimal.  It's a shame, because I really believe the FDA is trying to make it easier for companies like Adamis to introduce drugs like ZIMHI while still keeping american consumers safe. 

**Unfortunately, unless this is either** ***extraordinarily*** **easy to resolve or the company gets a major influx of capital, I don't think they will be able to remain solvent for the amount of time that it will take to clear this hurdle.**

23,StatusQuoBot,f8qljr4,/r/pennystocks/comments/e1h42j/admp_fda_unapproved_down_50/f8qljr4/,1,"Yes. I think they are really undervalued... even if Adamis is $176 million in the hole right now. With a generic EpiPen and a generic Narcan autoinjector that is 80% of the way to FDA approval, I don't understand why they wouldn't be an attractive candidate for a buyout. 

The fact that their rights to both the formulation and the injector device have withstood direct patent challenges, along with the absence of any other generic injectable competitor make them even more valuable. The market is tough to estimate but is insane and growing. The majority of Narcan is nasal spray, which isn't very expensive but ZIMHI is in an auto-injector and there isn't a generic equivalent. That means it's closest comp really is Evizio which sells for $2320 per syringe, and accounts for 18% of the total annual market for Naloxone.  The FDA projects 90.2 billion dollars in annual healthcare spending on naloxone in 2018-2020. And that's if they are estimating a cost per dose for the injectable to be $89. So either they need to get a generic approved or they're banking on a 96% reduction for name brand.  *\[Source, Slide 80/85* [*https://www.fda.gov/media/121189/download*](https://www.fda.gov/media/121189/download) *\]*
