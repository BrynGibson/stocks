Please, check these charts and see it by yourself:

These are only some examples for non believers. I'm not saying that every triple zero stock is going to reach pennyland, but there are enough cases to know that they can do it with the right conditions and news.

# CAPITAL FINANCIAL GLOBAL - $CFGX

&amp;#x200B;

CFGX has been a no-bid stock for the past 4 years. Nobody wanted to buy shares even at the cheaper price possible: $0.0001. However, around November 2017 this changed after the company released that they were working in two big deals that could inject revenues again:

[https://capfiglobal.com/investors/news/](https://capfiglobal.com/investors/news/)

This caused a buying pressure that drove the price back to $0.0001/$0.0002 bid/ask again. 

And we have been stuck at these levels until the last month when the company...

1. Paid its activity license in the state of Nevada, getting reinstated and active again:  
[https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=SxzOwZHm0zvktuDVt1bF1Q%253d%253d&amp;nt7=0](https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=SxzOwZHm0zvktuDVt1bF1Q%253d%253d&amp;nt7=0)  

2. Release all pending filings:  
[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/cfgx/disclosure](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/cfgx/disclosure)  


All of these are the natural steps to get the company back to OTC Pink Current tier again. This is the typical process that every OTC Pink company does when they have news to be released. Right now, the company only needs an opinion letter and two days after that they will become Pink Current and the stop sign removed. Based in my estimations, this could be this next week.

As you can see in the chart, the reinstatement in Nevada and the filings caused a big surge in volume and drove the price to $0.0003/$0.0004:

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&amp;uv=110794&amp;p=CFGX](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&amp;uv=110794&amp;p=CFGX)

Furthermore, the company has spent around $5k to get the reinstatement with the NVSOS, easily $2-3k for the filings and another $4k for the OTCMarkets fee. No company would do that after all these years waiting without anything if they are not going to announce something.

&amp;#x200B;

# WHAT MAKES CFGX INTERESTING?

&amp;#x200B;

1. A great share structure for a triple zero stock: only 2B float. If you check $ANDI (first chart above), you will see that it ran to $0.04 with more than 3.5B float...
2. Pending deals that would give a book value above $0.01
3. No toxic debt
4. A transparent CEO that NEVER has pumped the stock like 99% of Pink CEOs do. The company has been silent for a very long time and they have had the opportunity to pump a bit easily for example back in November 2017 and they never did.

These are enough ingredients to drive the price very high from current levels. Yes, I know what many of you are thinking after analyze the filings: the company has not cash and a lot of debt. Yes, that's true, but this is before any deal is closed and revenues start coming again. But, apart of this, do you know that $ANDI ran basically with a similar horrible financials and even without revenues? OTC Pink is the market where magic happens, never underestimate its potential.

Taking all of this into consideration, I believe it's realistic to give the company a conservative target price of $0.005 if any of these deals are finally closed. Time will tell but one thing is sure: the right time to invest is now, not then. This is a high risk / high profit play so, please, only invest what you are afford to lose and do your own DD.

AMFE just put out some EPIC numbers!  Audited revenues for fiscal 2017 now shows a total of $8,168,251, a difference to the upside of $1,637,278 compared to the unaudited statements previously filed showing $6,530,973. This was due to an inputting error that consolidated certain transactions using only the net revenues as opposed to both the gross and the net.

The company also said it has submitted the required documentation to OTC Markets to up-list to the OTCQB Venture Market and anticipates the up-list to be approved and completed in the coming weeks. The company has worked out an agreement with OTC Markets where payments made to the exchange will be pro-rata and applied to the application and listing fees if/when a second up-list occurs this year to the OTCQX Best Market.

the completion of the audit and subsequent up-list will allow for the previously announced spinoff of the Interloc-Kings Inc. subsidiary. In conjunction with the spin-off, shareholders will be awarded with a special dividend in the newly formed entity based upon their holdings in Amfil Technologies Inc (AMFE). This initiative has been developed to fuel the growth for each subsidiary and will provide a well-deserved bonus to the shareholders who have held strong and supported us through this period of growth and development. Specific details relating to the spinoff, including the record-date, plans for the new entity, and awarded share ratios of the special dividend will be announced in a future press release.
