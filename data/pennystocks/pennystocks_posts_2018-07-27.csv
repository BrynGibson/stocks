2,KULR Carbon Velvet Enables Cooler Digital Gear,92a0lp,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/92a0lp/kulr_carbon_velvet_enables_cooler_digital_gear/,2,0,"This editorial piece from Tirias Research (Forbes contributor) discusses the significance KULR Technology's (OTC: KUTG) Carbon Fiber Cooling technology (CFC or carbon velvet):

KULR Carbon Velvet Enables Cooler Digital Gear

Managing heat has been a growing concern in consumer electronics as performance increases, form factors shrink and applications push mobile design requirements. As a result, designing systems to manage heat has become an art of balancing endless trade-offs, as demonstrated by the recent Samsung Galaxy Note 7 issues. However, KULR Technology is introducing a flexible carbon fiber heat sink that may eliminate many of the design trade-offs, while enabling a new generation of electronic form factors.

When first approached about the concept of using carbon fiber in consumer electronics, my first thought was using it as the case, which has already been done. What KULR is doing is completely different. KULR has developed a velvet material made from carbon fibers. Not only does carbon fiber have higher tensile strength than steel when combined with epoxies or resins, it also has incredible heat conducting properties, making it a natural heat sink. When you combine vertical strands of carbon fiber into a velvet-like material, you create a heat sink that has a larger surface area. A larger surface area means that carbon fiber-based materials can dissipate more heat than traditional metal heat sinks.

KULR calls the material carbon velvet. The resulting heat sink or thermal interface material is called FTI. FTI is flexible in both its composition and application. KULR can change the length and density of the fibers in its carbon velvet to change the heat transfer characteristics and cost. In application, the material can mold to a circuit board and its chips like a blanket. In addition to dissipating heat, this blanket also reduces the design requirements associated with traditional heat sinks, and eases the assembly of the final product.

The flexible nature of the carbon velvet allows for creative product form factors, such as devices that mold to body parts. In talking to the KULR technical staff about the technology, it is also easy to see how the carbon velvet could be adapted to an almost endless list of applications ranging from augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets to servers, electric vehicles, and renewable energy applications.

Carbon fiber heat transfer technology is not new. It was originally developed over two decades ago for extremely demanding applications that could absorb the expense, including aerospace and industrial equipment. KULR’s proprietary manufacturing process is the enabling factor for wider adoption of carbon velvet technology. KULR can manufacture carbon velvet at competitive price points for many applications that might not have considered carbon fiber heat transfer solutions.

7,$INTK (Industrial Nanotech) - Now is the time to get in!,92c9x8,sh4dy15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/92c9x8/intk_industrial_nanotech_now_is_the_time_to_get_in/,10,5,"Not going to go crazy advocating and arguing with people on this as I am very confident it is going to move signficantly but just a heads up for those still looking to get in at a decent price here. INTK was non reporting for 2 years, really struggled as a company. I know there may be people in here that have been burned by this in the past but just do some research on your own and you will see the turnaround in progress. American company working internationally with some large clients, new websites, new twitter page, active social media team, new product design and distribution, etc. 

In the past they were having major distribution issues but it seems that has been resolved. Company cut back significantly on staffing at the end of 2016 and all of 2017 was really a turnaround year. Check out the chart and you will see how things have been in an upswing for the past 6 months. 

Industrial Nanotech manufactures nanotech paints for multiple uses and actually seems to be making some noise as they have recently been in a few nanotech reports/studies. 

INTK (Industrial Nanotech) is a company with a subsidiary named Synavax. As of a month or so ago they are now a special order vendor at Lowes and soon hopefully Home Depot (Feel free to call and verify yourself, vendor number 88790)

Over the past year they have been making a massive turnaround. Company has submitted documents and filings to get re-registered on OTCMarkets. They are just waiting for the filings to post, which could happen at any minute. This would bring them current and have a big impact on share price (IMO). 

Check it out, might still have some time but filings could come at any moment. 

All of this is in my opinion so please do your research first. ",2018-07-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/92c9x8/intk_industrial_nanotech_now_is_the_time_to_get_in/

11,"I messed up, need some advice.",92fqgv,SMA5HN1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/92fqgv/i_messed_up_need_some_advice/,28,44,"Hello everyone. 

I royally screwed the pooch on this one. 

Long story short.. I played my first penny stock about 3 years ago. I did EXTREMELY well on this play making about $150,000 during the hype of the stock. Because i was new at this, and it being my first play, I didn't really know when i should take my money out. I compared the company to other companies that were similar and decided that i would hold long-term as i think the stock will keep growing (compared to the price of competitors in the same space). I now know that just because a competitors stock price is higher, doesn't make it more valuable. The underlying factor that i learned is that in this arena, share structure is huge. The ticker ended up bottoming out after some time, and i actually lost money on this play. Worst mistake of my life so far.. 

Well, i figured if i did that on my first play, i should try again and just pull out when the stock got high enough instead of just leaving it alone. This was a good plan until i realized that i suck at pulling my money out. I hastily admit that i easily get greedy and when i see myself making so much money, i never want to take it out. This is my problem. I am stuck holding the bag on about 10 tickers that have completely bottomed out. Very low volume, some of them have large SS making them almost impossible to move, etc.. I am down about $20,000 and dont know what to do. I havent sold any of my shares yet because nobody will buy them. The small amount of money that i still have in the account have pretty much been wrote off and that i am not getting it back. This is obviously a very costly mistake on my part, but is there any hope? Are there any ways that i can get my money back? Would you continue to hold, or just put a long term sell order in and cut my losses when the order fills?

Any advice is hugely helpful, thanks in advance! ",2018-07-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/92fqgv/i_messed_up_need_some_advice/
