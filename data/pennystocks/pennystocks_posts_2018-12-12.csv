(""GROW"") (TSX-V: GROW, OTCQB: BLONF, Frankfurt: 4021) is pleased to announce the signing of its first Commercial Agreement.

GROW has granted a technology site license to US based Tumbleweed Farms a greenhouse grower for a patent protected CO2 Foliar Spray system. The technology site license term is perpetual. Engineering installation starts immediately for completion in January 2019.  The date of the agreement is December 4, 2018.

Fees upon start-up will be paid monthly on a per square foot basis. Fees charged will cover engineering support, installation, monitoring and telemetry of GROW's Foliar Spray technology as well as the technology site license.  

This US grower was more than satisfied with all of GROW's plant science research and commercial grow trial results so went directly to a commercial installation.    

John Archibald, CEO, stated ""This is the first of a series of expected Commercial Agreements in four plant verticals GROW is targeting for 2019 – indoor and outdoor cannabis, hemp, flowers and leafy vegetables in North America. While the revenues from this technology site license will be modest initially there is the potential for revenues to grow significantly over time"".
