I just lost hundreds on $4 PLUG calls believing that after their inevitably positive conference call yesterday they would remain above $4. But after their incredibly positive call, there was literally nothing negative, the sp was kept below 3.90. I say say kept because I think it was shorters on the attack once again. I know that Fcel is on of the most shorted stocks out there so beware. 

The stock market is no longer about investing, at least not on the short to mid term. It‚Äôs about people manipulating it to make money for themselves. It really sucks for companies that want to grow and for people who want to invest in them.",2020-02-01

Penny stocks are not Microsoft or Apple. If they had legitimate business models they wouldn‚Äôt be penny socks. The best thing someone told me years ago is ‚Äúsell if you made money you‚Äôre happy with.‚Äù
