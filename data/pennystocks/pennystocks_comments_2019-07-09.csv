But, I still have 20k shares that I grabbed around two cents a few weeks back, also with profit from somewhere else.  

Despite the company being nothing special, I think it's worth hanging on to.  I'm really just here to see if the company manages to go through with a name and symbol change, and an uplist to OTCQB.  

If the company can pull those two things off like they said they plan on doing, nothing else really matters.  It's enough to spike it up to .20+ for a day or two, and I'll get out with a few grand.

PASADENA, CA–(June 4, 2019) – Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTC: BMIX) (the “Company” or “Brazil Minerals”) announced today that it has obtained the last necessary approval from a regulatory entity in Brazil to allow mining for gold and diamonds in one of its many Jequitinhonha River Valley mineral rights. As announced previously, a drilling campaign within this project area indicated that 35 out of 35 drills holes were positive for gold. Additionally, in a majority of such drill holes, satellite markers that indicate the likely presence of diamonds were recovered. 

Marc Fogassa, CEO of Brazil Minerals, commented, “This news is timely and very well received. We have built a strong local team that is able to work diligently through complex and changing requirements for licensing and permitting for mining. It’s beginning to bear fruit and we’re not stopping here as we want to be producing revenues from multiple mining sites in due time.” 

Brazil Minerals believes that the initial excavation to attain the level needed for auriferous and diamondiferous gravel removal will take six to eight weeks, after which regular processing should start.
