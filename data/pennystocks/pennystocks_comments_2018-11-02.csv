Are you candaian and is that why everything is an F stock ? 

PTNYF never hit .44 . its been under .30 for a week . but i'm guessing that could be your average if you bought 51 shares at .30 . . $15 in shares+ $7 to trade = $22 / 51 shares = .44 average cost . .  the stock has to move 50% for you to break even. this should be a lesson that you probably shouldn't buy that small of a position. . . 

you've taken the ""buy and hope/hold"" approach which is good, but IMO, try to save $300 in cash to hop on something FRESH/FLIP more short term.",2018-11-02

For example, drone delivery Canada has close allies in the conservative government, but is also working with the liberal government. in the long run they will get the keep the government contracts they currently have. 

I am a Canadian but I prefer the US dollar so I convert it all to American. 

When Amazon announced they would work with parcelpal starting immediately in America, I bought as fast as I can. there's a potential labor dispute with Canadian parcel delivery, so the opportunity is there for them to expand immediately in Canada. As well, Amazon is building a thousand person parcel Hub in my area, and they are likely to use a service like parcelpal. 

Retirement may be a few years away, but that's okay. I do a lot more, so this would just help me along my journey. 

A dream I've always had is to have my own Farm, so as I potentially sell-off drone delivery and parcelpal, I will continue to buy up stock and Global hemp group. Who knows, maybe one day I buy the whole thing haha.

Investing in (for example) biotechs, just because they seem to ""pump and dump"" doesn't mean you're not investing in something real.  Many of them aren't PnD's - they may fail to pass FDA regulatory testing.  You can see upcoming PDUFA dates here: https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/fda-calendar
Also...Is a drone more real than a cure for cancer?  What? 

Dumping 1k into penny stocks that you ""feel"" have ""real"" value is not due diligence.  Companies have great ideas, products, IP, and research but still manage to fail.
If your plan is to (what I'm going to call, for now) baghold these companies until they turn into something, in my opinion you're better off to throw it into a 10 year bond and be happy with that. 

You said ""any questions, send them my way,"" but are getting upset at people calling you out for what, to many, is an unbacked financial decision.  As if none of us would like to pick a few companies *we* think have value and turn that 1k into 1000k.

You also made contradictory claims.  You want to turn the 1k into a MM ASAP - but don't want to play the pump and dump game.  Ok so...you picked these companies and you're bullish long - how long?  1 year? 10?  Because anything past a year and you're going to be waiting a long, long time to rake in that sweet million by just playing the long game - and that's provided ALL of your picks are correct.

So you see the confusion of many people here; 1k into a million asap, BUT only with companies that make something cool, without playing the dips, with zero trading experience.  Are you willing to trade on margin?  How much?  Can you trade on margin?  

The reason you're getting responses like this one is because you presume, first, that people would have any question to ask a brand new trader with a bizarre trading philosophy any question other than ""The fuck you thinking bro?""

There's always the possibility you know something about these companies that no one else knows - if that's the case, all the power to you.  However, if you really did know something, I tend to doubt you'd be flaunting that knowledge anywhere, to anything that could possibly be linked to you.  The SEC are fickle about this funny thing called insider trading.

Regardless, good luck, but do not be surprised when any or all of these companies takes a giant dump on your portfolio.  If you have any solid analysis on why these companies are more deserving of your hard-earned cash, I'd be happy to hear it, though skeptical if I will.

Estimated earnings were bad, market opened and it dropped, it came out as positive and it spiked. But it very well could have kept dropping. It‚Äôs actually back close to where it was yesterday. Market sentiment has a large roll to play too. Kinda like what happened in October...almost. That was more of a market correction and luckily everyone seemed to rally against it and pushed it back up in the green. At least for the last two weeks. But there‚Äôs been many times that people react to these big down trends and start selling...which causes a domino effect.
