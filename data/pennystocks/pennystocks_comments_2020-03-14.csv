You make money by seeing trends and gambling on their eventuality. 

For example. Corona virus hits China, there are lots of people wearing masks, so you invest in a mask company. Stock explodes, you set limits and walk away with a bunch of money. That same stock will üöÄ to the Moon here, then you buy it right before it dies and are stuck holding the bag.

I can't really find anything worth investing in.

I was in a stock (I think it was SPEX), and it went to 5.06. If I could've cashed out at that point, I would've had $25k in my portfolio and would've been able to day trade as much as I wanted. Instead, it halted and crashed into the $4's. THANK GOD I was able to sell at like 4.06, but I saw $6k in profit vanish in the blink of an eye. Literally AS SOON AS the halt was over. Now it's in the $1's though I think, so I consider myself lucky being able to get out when I did.

With most of these stocks, even if you KNOW that it's a pump and dump, you want to be able to ride the pump. But most start dumping with no warning. You can study all you want, figure out support/resistance, follow all the right people, etc., but it seems like it's all just manipulated by people with a lot more money.

Because of awful trading this week, I went from $25k all the way back down to $10k in the span of a week.

I originally considered shorting to be unethical, but I may have to resort to shorting. They seem to actually make money in many cases depending on the stock.

* You have the option of a weekly call/put, or a longer term call/put

* You then select a ""strike price"" that you believe the stock will hit within the given time frame

* Depending on if it's a put or call, the options price will reflect the strikes distance to the current trading price

* ABC is at $250, you buy weekly calls for $300 for $0.01. ABC has an earnings call that shoots them over $320 the next day. You can now either hold the option til it expires, or sell it for its new price.

short selling is an important skill to know bc it's the opposite of buying long. if you're a serious trader you pretty much need to know how to short bc you can make money regardless of how the market is moving. however short selling has a greater risk than going long bc you're borrowing something from your broker, and if it goes against you you can end up owing your broker money. why do people not like inverse etfs? because they charge a management fee of 1% a day or so (well depending on the etf). so the stock price moves down by that much every single day regardless what it's doing (the management fee is priced into the etf). but if you can ride them up can make a decent amount of money. but you need to be very quick on your feet, bc they go down just as fast as they go up. if you know how to short you don't need to worry about management fees. inverse etfs appeal to beginners bc they don't need to short or have a margin account. options are probably less risky than shorting bc you can limit your losses. know everything, know every way to make money. learn about futures too. learn about commodities. trade bitcoin. trade forex. there's so much stuff to know but they're all correlated the more you know the better. anyway, that's all I can help you with for now. good luck.",2020-03-14

I was looking at this one though.  In Trading 212 it says it trades on the London Stock Exchange (I'm in the UK) and charges are listed as:  
**Charges taken from the Fund over a year**  
**Ongoing charges  0.50%**

It lists no other fees.  So am I right in thinking that's the only charge (Trading 212 has no charges)?  Doesn't sound like a bad bet to use day to day to short the S&amp;P500?

There was a 2x leveraged ETF, but it's on the German stock exchange and shorts the DAX:

Albert Barlett said ""The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function."" and covid19 is exponential with a doubling time of 7 days. people just don't understand the amount of hurt this thing can bring. wait until you see what's going to happen in india, africa, south america and other underdeveloped countries if you think what happened in italy is a big deal. satellites are showing mass graves being built in iran with no end in sight. I think leveraged inverse etfs are more like a day trading thing unless you want to just throw some money in and completely forget about it and hope that the will just continue going up regardless of its decay. given how serious this situation is I wouldn't be surprised if inverse etfs go up for many months to come. I personally didn't work out the math on a long term strategy on inverse etfs. but maybe also look into options, from my understanding x3 inverse etfs are ""cute"" but options are  leveraged x100 since each option contract gives you the right (but not the obligation!) to buy (call option) or right to sell (put option) 100 shares of stock at a future date. also most people just trade options before they expire. also don't shy away from it bc ""it's hard"". it will take you all but an afternoon if you want to learn options. although it may take you a week or two to be comfortable with it. but as I said we're only in the start. as more and more countries shut down and as more people liquidate their money from gold, bitcoin, the stock market, and as more stores close (apple just closed all their stores) and small businesses get bankrupt, then this market will drop to sh*t. there will also be massive rallies though. the biggest bull rallies happen in bear markets. so traders that both go long and short are thriving right now.",2020-03-14

I completely agree with a lot of what you're saying, just so many seasoned investors talk about this bear market as if it could trade sideways or even upwards in the coming week despite the massive economical impact this virus is going to have worldwide.  Having never paid attention to the markets (apart from knowing them crashing) during 2008 I'm not really that familiar with how it all played out.

I actually have some money invested at the moment that's currently 13% down.  I was even thinking of taking it, or at least half out on Friday but talked myself out of it again just in case things change.  I guess I'd probably be more on edge if I did wondering whether I'd made the right decision.  

I do have more money to invest though and was thinking about putting more into my Global Tracker ETF and/or investing into blue chip companies. Most people seem to have been saying for the past few weeks to DCA, but I've specifically held off because it seemed guaranteed to go lower based on the affect that is going to be felt from all the flight/event/sporting cancellations, quarantines and so on that are only just coming into place and are only going to get worse over the coming weeks.  

I'll have more of a read about options in the coming week.  I was mostly thinking of using them just to potentially hedge any further losses on my money currently invested.  I don't need the money any time soon though to be honest so it's not the end of the world, but it seemed stupid not to try and at least look into ways I could mitigate any loss from this or make some gains from the companies who are much 'cheaper'.  Perhaps just going long on some blue chip companies and putting more money into my ETF will be the easiest way though for me.  

To be honest though, it is pretty fun and definitely interesting learning about and putting your money into the stock market, which is probably a bit worrying as I've never been a much of a gambler and always a little cautious...",2020-03-14

Look up FAANG companies, XOM, etc. When we get to the other side, companies like Microsoft will be even stronger. Meanwhile if TVIX drops down more than it is now, buy back in.
