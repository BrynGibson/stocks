&amp;#x200B;

NEW YORK, Oct. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ""Hair Metal"" fans rejoice!  VNUE, Inc. (OTCQB: VNUE) has announced that the company is partnering with all of the bands on the SirusXM Hair Nation Tour and will be recording select shows on the tour for immediate release as limited edition collectible laminates and instant digital download via VNUE's [set.fm](http://set.fm/)proprietary web and mobile (iOS &amp; Android) platform.  Each laminate will contain scratch-off codes so that fans may download all of the bands performances of a given night.

The tour consists of Jack Russell's Great White, which features VNUE's own Chief Creative Officer Tony ""Montana"" Cardenas on guitar, as well as the Bullet Boys and Enuf Z'Nuff.

The Hair Nation Tour is presented by SirusXM and Live Nation, and is hosted by music industry veteran, author and SiriusXM host Eddie Trunk, who is appearing at some of the tour dates.

The tour offers listeners and music fans the chance to see the bands who have been giving us decades of larger-than-life rock music, and VNUE will be there to capture and expertly produce every note.

Zach Bair, CEO of VNUE, said, ""This is the perfect tour for VNUE to leverage its DiscLive and set.fm technology and expertise, so that fans that have loved and followed these bands for years can have fresh live recordings of their favorite songs – performed at the very shows they attend!  Plus, what is exciting to me is that I get to work with my friend and colleague Tony as an artist, in addition to his role with VNUE.""

""VNUE and Set.fm has worked with some great artists, and we finally have a chance to work with my own band and bandmate, and the original voice of Great White, Jack Russell,"" said Cardenas.  ""All the pieces finally fell into place with this Sirius XM Hair Nation Tour.  The bands out on this tour, Jack Russell's Great White, Enuff Z' Nuff and the Bullet Boys, are great representatives of the scene we all were part of in the late 80's and early 90's.  We've even got the keeper of the rock and metal flame from the era, Eddie Trunk, as emcee.  This will be a knockout keepsake for all the fans that are coming out to relive this era.  So far, the shows have been great!  Can't wait to get out and start recording these for real!""

Music fans across the globe can pre-order digital copies of the shows by downloading the [set.fm](http://set.fm/) app from either the Apple App Store or Google Play, or by visiting [http://bit.ly/HairNationSetfm](http://bit.ly/HairNationSetfm).

&amp;#x200B;

PLAYA VISTA, Calif., Oct. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Premium Water Corporation (OTC Pink:HIPH) (the “Company”) announces that it has entered into an agreement with SinglePoint, Inc (OTC:SING) to distribute LALPINA Hydro CBD on two of their e-commerce channels; SingleSeed.com and DIGSHydro.com. The Company will drop ship product to the customers.   


Ryan Fishoff, CEO American Premium Water Corporation commented: “I am pleased to announce our distribution deal with SING. This is the Company’s first third party deal for LALPINA Hydro CBD, but it won’t be the last! These e-commerce arrangements are going to be a pillar of our e-commerce distribution strategy. Third-party sites will not only drive additional impressions for the LALPINA brand, it will also drive awareness of the Company to a wider audience. I think this distribution channel could bring in excess of a million of revenue over the life of the agreement. It’s great that we are partnering with a first-rate Company like SING. They are doing great things, and I hope this (agreement) is just the start of potential future collaborations down the line.”     


“We are excited to add infused CBD to a line of CBD products to SingleSeed. We have seen tremendous response to our SingleSeed e-commerce site and LALPINA Hydro CBD we believe will provide additional revenue for SinglePoint.” commented Wil Ralston, President, Singlepoint, Inc.

The two sites, Singleseed.com and DIGSHydro.com, are subsidiaries of SING. LALPINA Hydro CBD will be the first hydro-nano beverage to be sold on both sites. This agreement follows the DEA’s announcement last week removing CBD as Schedule 1 drug when there is 0.1% or less trace amounts of THC. LALPINA Hydro CBD contains non-detectable amounts of THC. Adding more outlets of distribution will further cement LALPINA Hydro CBD as a market front runner as the only CBD beverage that utilizes hydro-nano technology, by mixing hydro and encapsulating the CBD with Nano technology, LALPINA turns the CBD molecule into a water soluble compound, maximizing it's bioavailability and delivery to the body's cells and tissues. This technology allows consumers to have up to 90% more absorption rates than traditional CBD water.

American Premium Water Corp is the publicly holding trading company that owns LALPINA HYDRO, LALPINA HYDRO CBD, Gents, Worthy, and FashionCoinX.

Singlepoint, Inc SinglePoint, Inc (SING) is a technology and investment company whose portfolio includes mobile payments, ancillary cannabis services and blockchain solutions.

There is a certain step by step process for these new cryptocurrency  projects coming up that I highly recommend, though of course as always,  this is NOT financial/investment advice, purely educational.   How it works 1 The project creates its road map on the W12 platform, and sets the  settings for the number and % of funds required for each stage. 2 The project releases its simple ICO tokens on the W12 platform or  transfers part of the emission of its simple ICO tokens to be released  independently via the smart contract of the W12 platform. 3 The W12 blockchain protocol issues secured project tokens in equal  number to the amount of simple ICO tokens it has received. 4 W12 platform users can buy secured tokens of ICO projects they like. All  secured ICO tokens are backed by token buyer funds. 5 All funds raised are locked-up in a smart contract and will be released  to the project only following the decision of token buyers once it has  completed its road map milestones. 6 After purchasing secured ICO project tokens, the user can: exchange them for simple ICO project tokens via the W12 token-changer  and sell them on the listed exchange receive a refund if the project fails to reach any of its road map  milestones, or if the token price drops lower than its ICO level  -\~-\~\~-\~\~\~-\~\~-\~- Please watch: ""\*New Partnership\* Ultimate Stock Trading Course +  Research Reports""  ",2018-10-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9koukh/how_to_understand_token_sales_and_icos_w12_ico/
