i guess if you wanna know how i find these. at market open i use a scanner to find all stocks between 5cents and 99cents that have gained 15% value with over 300,000 volume

each pennystock that hits 15% gains i throw down 100dollars into. its only a few each day that gain 15%. then the ones that start making money i throw 300 more dollars into then another 300 then another 300 then i keep throwing in more 300's if they keep going up 

then that night i set a -5% stoploss on all my money positions. this will trigger the next day if the stock drops. and if it drops, it auto cashes me out. if it goes higher, i keep shares and set a -5% stoploss for the next day. keep riding the gains until the stoploss cashes me out",2018-06-28

the markets closed. i assume you mean you put in a buy order?

hold on that brah.  i should clarify they way you should be trading pennystonks

only drop 10% of your cash into CEI at open. if it dips, buy 10% more when you think the dip is over. then when it goes up. put in 14%.  then if it goes up more put another 7%

put in 6-10% portions of your cash to lower risk and buy dips.  

then the next day you can sell it all in 1 trade and its not a daytrade",2018-06-28

Phase I basically means no one died when they were exposed to the drug across the ranges they tested. Its the same as a chip sample in mining. There will usually be a peak in volume, but a fall back usually follows.

I'd hold out until after Phase II trials, and the lead in to Phase III if you want to churn, but you're looking at a year or two.

I don't hold this ticker yet, but I will add it to my watch list. May even set a position at 85c

if i get some nice picks i will post them. nice picks are found maybe once a week. besides that i just go off instincts in the moment

tmrw i will most likely just be looking for dips that look juicy to buy. i put a little money in a dip, then move on and look for another dip.  my bread and butter plan that usually works best for me is buying dips then selling a bit later if it goes in my favor


as for my usual pennystock strategy. my normal plan is to find a pennystock that has made 15% + gains and seems to have high volume and strong movement in either direction. which likely means theres some kind of hype giving the stock life .  then i try to identify where i think the lowest floor of the stock is. the price shouldnt drip beloe the ""floor"" usually

then if it dips more. i wait and throw in another 300 when i think that dip is over

if i have correctly judged the ""floor"" of the stock, then the price shouldnt drop below the floor. if it dips to the floor, i put in another 300 dollars and it should climb back to my original buy point. once it gains back, i make money from all lower dips i put money into
