2,How to deal with loss,c8pg5v,TheOddWire,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c8pg5v/how_to_deal_with_loss/,5,23,"I recently got into trading. I made some nice money and was happy to work with the dollars that I made. However, today my stock plummeted.  I got out before I lost too much, but I still lost 15% of my money in 20 minutes.

I'm not sure how to recover, but I'm now terrified to invest in anything. How do you guys deal with getting back into the game when you take a big loss?",2019-07-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c8pg5v/how_to_deal_with_loss/

7,TTCM more interesting INFO,c8o2ft,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c8o2ft/ttcm_more_interesting_info/,8,9,"Good morning all,
     I‚Äôve dropped a few subs on TTCM and here‚Äôs another. Some of you have shown interest and others not so much. If you are interested here are some links and excerpts about the company. 
The first link is Arknet‚Äôs vision for its platform. Klickzie is also an TTCM platform. What‚Äôs interesting is how they intend on monetizing Arks and Pictures. 
  I believe TTCM is first to the table with this type of AR platform. Question is will they be the MySpace (for those of you old enough to remember) or the Facebook for this type of AR???
  Regardless of which one it may become  I expect that in a few months this app will be rolling out.  Press releases will be coming out and pumpers will be driving this. The tech is to cool and it‚Äôs a great concept wether the public is ready for it or not. 
   Consider a position in this long or short term. Ride the spike and profit out or, ride the spike, profit out, and then take a new position once the dust clears and new support has been determined. 
    If you‚Äôre  good you can take profit and start a new position after the hype sells off and own a pile of shares for free for the long haul. 
   What ever your strategy is now is a good time to get in before the buy in takes off.
    Hope this is helpful for those who are interested.
