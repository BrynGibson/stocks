-How are other similar companies performing on the charts? Last week? Month? Year? etc

-Is their nearest chart movement influenced by something real? Could competitors show a similar benefit from the catalyst? 

-Have you looked at their financials? Like how's their debt situation looking? Do they have enough cash to pay off most if not all of their debt (total liabilities). 

-How much of the shares are owned by ""insiders?"" What is the short sale volume? 

and finally -"" Is the person or source I heard about this stock from completely unbiased? How do they scan for stocks? Do they get paid for what they post?

[So their most recent 10-q filing that I could pull up](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664038/000166357718000455/mainbody.htm) has a few items that are red flags for me and indicate that the profits to be had aren’t for shareholders.


Page 3: balance sheets (unaudited). The company has a stated total of 7,775k They state that they have 10,530,207k In prepaid assets.  
They also say they have 182,185k in total current liabilities. So a sloppy attempt at a quick ratio would show that the company has a a really great quick ratio (57.00ish), meaning that for every dollar of debt that have they have (57 dollars) of non debt.

That sounds nice but you have to think critically of the prepaid expenses. Since this sheet is unaudited, you can’t trust that those numbers are not just  artificially inflated  to make their company look more profitable to investors.
