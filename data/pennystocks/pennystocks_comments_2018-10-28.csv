However I am positive. My first penny investment was......HMNY \*facepalm\* but I learned a lot from that stock. I was about to just leave pennystocks alone as advised by many many comments in all the investing/stock subreddits but they just kept calling me. I started doing research. At the same time my wife was getting hooked on all the weed and pharmacy pennies. She was losing money left and right via selling too late, too early, buying too late etc. I honestly in a way learned a lot from her losses. I then took what i learned from her, and what i read on the web and changed the way I played with these stocks. I have been consistently making money on them ever since. I'll admit its only like $2 - 8$ here and there as I don't exactly have a ton of cash to throw at it yet, but shit the way I look at it now I'm like that $5 I didn't have before. Also I personally only play with 1 penny stock at a time. The rest of my money goes to my real investments. To tell the truth the only reason I even play with them is cause the real stocks are boring and the penny's give me a reason to look at my phone every morning lol.

&amp;#x200B;

The only bits of advice I can give to anyone that I have picked up is this - whatever you put in, pretend you will never ever see that money again. If you have a loss well you have a loss. Your stock just went down 5 cents? Well fuck it just keep that stock for a while and hope it goes back up again someday. Don't get greedy, these stocks will get your hopes up and then come down to crush your soul. Stock went up 10 cents? Sell that shit and move on. These dreams of stocks going from 30 cents to dollars in a day don't happen very often. See someones post ranting and raving about a certain stock going to the moon? It probably won't but you can capitalize on the hype train and snag a few cents probably. Hell if I were you I hype it up right along with them.

Currently in KGET, ABVG at the bottom.  EPXY at .0002, BLDV at .0005

Limit your downside by buying the lowest pennies that are not delisted or failing and wait for some manipulation (or in rare cases, actual progress) to drive them up.  It's a long term game.  I put a portion of penny gains back into pennies, focusing on the lowest priced stocks that have volume to limit the downside.  If you buy at .0001 there's not a lot of places they can go and it's a 100% gain per .0001 increase.  It's a boom or bust play.

You could also look for stocks that are channeling in a fairly stable way and trade them over months.

Watch out for pennies that ""expand"" into the flavors of the week: CBD oil, cannabis and crypto at the moment.  These are mostly scam stocks where the insiders are blatantly manipulating.  Never buy into any rally on these after this sort of news, it doesn't last very long.

Not during. They released positive clinical data. That was extremely high. So I decided to do trade. Buy the time I bought I had noticed the price jumped about 14 cents which made me second guess but I’m glad I followed through. You just don’t know what way the stock can swing. Remember this is just clinical data. For pre lim. It wasn’t about till a week later final results came in positive with an FDA approval. That’s when it went to $10. Still can be risky. I could have bought and results came back negative and everyone sold. It could be as low as .30 a share when I bought in at $1. ,2018-10-28
