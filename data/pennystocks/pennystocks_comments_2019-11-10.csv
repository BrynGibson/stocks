Acquisition play.
 
They are developing a new kind of memory that sits between DRAM and NAND Flash. It is called Resistive RAM, ReRam.
 
Just a matter of time before ReRam semiconductors are in every data centre the Globe over. 
 
They partner with Western Digital. Western Digital are the natural acquirer, but SK Hynix and Amazon and the like (both makers and users of memory) would be keen if the technology checks out.",2019-11-10

23,1stPostISwear,f7c8t7j,/r/pennystocks/comments/du84rk/any_asx_penny_stocks/f7c8t7j/,1,"They could announce that the extension they seek with development facility, imec, is only 3 to 6 months. This would indicate they, 4DS management, are confident that they will achieve their goal of a satisfactory Megabit chip. This/these Megabit chip/s will be tested and analysed for their performance. Should the performance be solid, then they are likely to be bought out by Western Digital or the like. So it could indicate a ~1st half 2020 calendar year buyout for (hopefully) multiples of the current SP.
 
Now, on the other hand, they may announce a longer extension with development facility, imec. Say, 12 months. This would indicate that they, 4DS management, are not confident that they will achieve a satisfactory Megabit chip sooner and will therefore need more time for development. The market would likely react to such news by selling off a little, and driving the SP down as folks may not wish to tie up capital in the company for a further 12 months.
 

 One of 4DS's  last announcements mentions the extension with imec, but gives no timeframe, hence the anticipation.

 
The chips in development are a new, faster more efficient way of storing digital memory. They are targeting cloud data centre storage, which, so far as I can tell, is only becoming more common part of modern day infrastructure and necessity.",2019-11-10

27,1stPostISwear,f7cmvsz,/r/pennystocks/comments/du84rk/any_asx_penny_stocks/f7cmvsz/,1,"Yes. 
Until they start convincing bigger institutional investors they will remain at this level. And to do that they basically need a proof of concept de-risked enough for an industry player like Western Digital to take them out. That is what the supposed 'Megabit test chip' will do (we hope).
 
Previous proof of concepts were kilobit level or single cell. As you create larger arrays you introduce more links in the chain. Each link is a potential for the chain to break. These need to be troubleshot and worked through. If they can't be worked through with satisfactory results then the project falls over and this gets chalked up as really useful research and exploration, but ultimately non commercial project.",2019-11-10
