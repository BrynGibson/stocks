Innovation Pharmaceuticals Brilacidin Received by U.S. Regional Biocontainment Laboratory; Testing Against Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
WAKEFIELD, MA ‚Äì March 9, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB:IPIX) (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, announces today the Company has been notified by one of the 12 Regional Biocontainment Labs (RBLs) in the United States that it received shipment of Brilacidin, the Company‚Äôs defensin mimetic drug candidate, for testing against SARS-CoV-2, the specific coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Brilacidin is immediately being placed into queue and the Company anticipates confirmation of the testing schedule as well as procedures for the studies later this week.
 
Brilacidin and COVID-19
The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak poses a significant life-threatening and economic risk throughout the world. Over 109,500 cases have been diagnosed in at least 95 countries, resulting in 3,800 reported deaths, including 479 cases and 21 fatalities in the U.S. There are no effective approved therapies to treat COVID-19. Brilacidin is one of the few drugs targeting COVID-19 that has been tested in human trials for other clinical indications, providing an established safety and efficacy profile, thereby potentially enabling it to rapidly help address the emerging worldwide coronavirus crisis, developed both as an intravenous medicine and as a vaccine. There is no assurance made or implied that testing Brilacidin for antiviral activity against any coronavirus will be successful.

AIM ImmunoTech‚Äôs Drug Ampligen to Be Tested by Japan‚Äôs National Institute of Infectious Diseases as a Potential Treatment for the New SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Responsible for the New Human Infectious Disease COVID-19
Monday, March 9, 2020 6:30 AM
OCALA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2020 / AIM ImmunoTech (NYSE American:AIM), an immuno-pharma company focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat immune disorders, viral diseases and multiple types of cancers, today announced that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan will begin testing AIM's drug Ampligen as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the new coronavirus infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The experimental program will be conducted at both the NIID and the University of Tokyo.

The testing and research are being conducted by Hideki Hasegawa, MD, PhD, Director of the NIID's Influenza Virus Research Center, and Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Tokyo and Takeshi Ichinohe, PhD, Department of Pathology at the NIID, Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science.

""As we have been saying all along, this emerging pandemic is caused by a virus that has nearly identical regulatory RNA sequences to the original SARS coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-1, in respect to pathogenesis. This means that the prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against the new virus. The WHO has recently renamed this emerging, highly pathogenic virus as SARS-CoV-2,"" said AIM CEO Thomas K. Equels. ""Ampligen had excellent antiviral activity against the earlier SARS coronavirus in U.S. National Institutes of Health-contracted animal experiments. In those studies of SARS-infected mice, Ampligen stands out as the only drug tested that conferred a significant survival effect: 100% of the Ampligen-treated mice survived, while none of the untreated mice survived. Because SARS-CoV-2 shares many critical similarities with SARS-CoV-1, Ampligen may have an important role to play in developing a protective early-onset therapy for this new highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, where currently there is no known effective therapy. We are proud to work with Japan's universally esteemed NIID in the battle to curb this emerging potential pandemic.""

Ampligen has established itself as a broad-spectrum antiviral with an extremely well-developed safety profile (See: ""Ampligen as an Antiviral,"" safety slides 7-15, at https://aimimmuno.com/events-presentations/).

Massive insider buys recently.

They have three investor conferences in March. The next one is next Sunday, March 15th. This should run into Friday closing. Results being released at that conference is legitimately possible within the timeline. The study concluded weeks ago.

Phase 2 results could drop any day but are officially expected early April.

AG013, with good results, will almost certainly lead to licensing deals or a buyout. It‚Äôs an FDA fast-racked drug and EU Orphan drug with a very conservatively estimated $750M annual sales market. Based on previous results, it‚Äôs expected to be at least 70% effective for Oral Muctosis, a painful symptom in 70% of chemo and radiation patients.

It‚Äôs both a prevention and treatment. There is no other drug like it. It uses genetically altered bacteria to deliver a treatment the bacteria itself produces directly to the wound through a mouth rinse.

I added more today to bring my total to 16,000 shares.

This stock, with good results, is easily valued at $3+ a share.

My knowledge so far comes from watching YouTube vids and reading forums. I dl'd RH because I heard it was easy to learn and invest, so far it has been but I noticed RH doesn't offer some stocks like many listed here. Is there an app that offers free trades like RH but with more options and that's easy to navigate? 

FYI I'm only in for $100 rn until I learn more. I started buying and selling the same day on RH until I got flagged for day trading, didn't know you couldn't do that without 25k in your acct. which will likely never happen. I sold my free stocks the first week, watched some YT vids and bought ibio at .29 and got impatient after a week of it doing nothing and sold it at .29. Basically I have a lot to learn lol, sorry for the ramble but any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2020-03-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ffneo0/better_than_robinhood/

Friday at closing I was interested in a stock that was around .70.  I checked it now and it's over $2. So does that mean Monday morning it will open at $2 ( assuming things stay the same ) Is it generally a bad idea to buy in right when the market opens? In the past I've bought after hours but both times the order cancelled at the end of the day. Any advice would be appreciated. I may have held on a little too long to Ibio tho I did get in early at .71, mistakenly jumped into ino at $15.50  and didn't grab spec early enough.

Currently they are using their horsepox vaccine to find a cure for Corona Virus. Southern Research partnered with them and they are trying to make a vaccine by expressing one or more of Covid-19‚Äôs proteins in the HorsePox Vector. It almost looks like they might have a slight jump on some competition due to this. 

Recently they committed to an offering that has now closed for 16 million last week. At the current moment the company has around 35 million in cash equivalents. In addition to this, it only has 49 million outstanding shares and at the moment is up 10% premarket. It‚Äôs a lot less shares than many of the other bio companies and it‚Äôs just something to think about. 

I‚Äôd get in early because someone has been accumulating if you look at the chart from the last few days. Anyways guys happy trading and good luck out there.",2020-03-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ffrnoe/tnxp_the_corona_virus_stock_you_havent_heard_of/
