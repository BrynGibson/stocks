**Hi, I have the infinity plan of palm beach (Legacy group) which means i get ALL things Palm Beach for life.  Tom Ford and Teeka Tiwari are the founders.**

Paid a ridiculous amount for it and have looked for several who may wish to share costs for access.

**--So there are 2 crypto projects which is all i'm interested in sharing:** 

 **1.**  The Palm Beach Confidential Newsletter and associated, info, buy/sell alerts, weekly updates, etc.  This covers all of crypto and is the backbone of the Palm Beach services.

**2.** The Crypto Income Quarterly:  which is a great publication focusing on dividend crypto (usually done through staking not mining - basically you hold in wallet for a certain time).  These are usually much smaller projects with a lot more upside 100x etc.

I'm willing to cut you an EXTREME deal for 1 full year access from today.  This will help ME pay for my huge cost for this subscription.  You also get access to me as a friend in crypto and I'm happy to help you if you are a noob and need help with basics.  

\-these retail for 3k and 5k EACH yearly (or sometimes for 2 years depending on when you sign up)!   I have them both.
