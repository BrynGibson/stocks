https://t.co/pzvkjRqiyx is the YDF Pattern on the weekly a bearish or bullish one? 

This looks to be headed back to .16 and if not any SP increase will be met with a 1:30 R/S. Play this one with tight stops and don't hold over night is my opinion. 0.22 is cheap until you realize that 0.16 is about a 30% loss.",2020-02-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7q6c0/tblt_ta_alert_weekly_pattern_revealed/

7,Cancer cure? $TOCA might have it,f7uly7,WeDontLetHateWin,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7uly7/cancer_cure_toca_might_have_it/,1,23,"I've been watching cancer-related healthcare companies and one that jumped through the roof is $TOCA. I know... it might be too high now (1.90 after hours) after it closed at 0.90 from mid .50s; but hear me out: if they actually have a cure (which phase 2 starts mid year) this is going to make this a 10s+ stock. I would wait to see how it opens monday but keeping a very close look.

DD: **$TOCA** \+111.11% @ 0.90 CLOSE â€“ 1.90 AH

TOCAGEN INC is a clinical-stage, cancer-selective gene therapy company. It focuses on the development of product candidates designed to activate a patient's immune system against their own cancer from within. 

**MRKT CAP:** $45.406M

**OUTSTANDING SHARES:** 23.898M (!!!)

**NEWS:** $TOCA recently announced a **reverse merger** with Forte Bioscience in all-stock deal. (!!!)

**AVG PRICE:** Tocagenâ€™s stock nearly doubled since the announcement, but thatâ€™s not saying much as itâ€™s been floating around the **50-cent** mark since its layoffs in October.  **It broke this resistance price, now it's on the 1.Xs.**

**BAD NEWS:** The company reported in September that its lead candidate, a gene therapy called **Toca 511** and **Toca FC**, **failed** a phase 3 study targeting patients with recurrent high-grade glioma undergoing surgery to remove their tumor.

**GOOD NEWS:** The merger is slated to close in the second quarter, after which an investor syndicate including OrbiMed, Alger and BVF Partners will **invest** **$14 million**. 

That will bring the companyâ€™s war chest to **$25 million** as it looks to advance its lead asset, FB-401, and other clinical programs. Forte expects to start a **phase 2 study of FB-401**, a live biotherapeutic, by the middle of the year. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**: Given that this broke the cents mark, I can only see this going up, or staying around that price until mid-year. 

**IF YOU PLAY OPTIONS**: Premium are very low for a monthlies. One expiring in September, is less than $1 per contract. A put won't be a bad idea, but given the investment + new leadership + new company (two companies for 1): it will lose money in the short-term.

**IF YOU PLAY STOCKS**:  Buy, hold hold hold. This is not a quick buck stock.",2020-02-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7uly7/cancer_cure_toca_might_have_it/
8,[NEW BLOG] The Best Stock Trading Indicators!ðŸ“ˆ,f7tm22,mtmtrader,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7tm22/new_blog_the_best_stock_trading_indicators/,1,24,"Chart indicators are tools used by traders and investors to help predict future price movement in the market. There are hundreds of available trading indicators and unfortunately, many traders abuse the power of having all of these tools at their expense by using too many at one time! 

Now for the record, I know there are really no *""best""* indicators. The word ""best"" is opinionated and many people will probably disagree with the indicators that I personally believe to be the best. Regardless, it's important to only focus on the indicators that you believe to be the best and avoid crowding your charts with others.
