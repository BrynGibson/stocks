""On April 21, 2020 the FDA approved an at-home sample collection device for Covid-19 testing, allowing individuals to purchase the collection kits, collect their own samples and then use the mails or other package service to deliver the sample to a laboratory for assay. Oftentimes government moves slowly, but they also tend to build large doors and then open them. DECN views this as an opportunity to become the first company to provide an all-in-one, immediate result, individual at-home Covid-19 test kits with its GenViro! Swift kit for at-home use. We intend to file our stand-alone EUA application for the individual use GenViro! Swift kit by May 1. We anticipate the application to include data gleaned from our GenViro Professional kit application. We also anticipate a request to direct us to conduct a donor study of a modest group of donors. We have already identified a group in Pennsylvania to make use of the Genviro! Swift Home kit. Additional testing required for this kit is anticipated to take less than a week. ""

547,MeIn2016LUL,fobe2dm,/r/pennystocks/comments/g6ot2p/the_decn_dump_has_commenced/fobe2dm/,1,"Nice. It was obvious because firstly, the stock price is increasing on hype/anticipation and news - so nothing substantial as yet. Secondly, most big buyers are aware and they will dump before news just because they know that the potential to dump far outweighs the potential the stock price will rise, even with good news. There has to be a pullback at some point. 

You have to consider that so far the stock price has risen up only on news and hype - and that's not a movement that usually keeps its gains. 

Also, the FDA approval - at this point - may already be factored into the price as people bought in anticipation that they would get an approval. So now even if they get the approval, you might not see the price action move as significantly. 

I was about 90% sure that there would be a dump before or after news. These type of pumps, on hype and news, usually do not last very long and when the stop losses start getting triggered, it becomes a downwards cascading effect. 

I had said yesterday that I expect this to dump and got downvoted, lol.

The delay is seen as good news, as cutting production in this month could cause volatility in current month's obligations of production (and increased risk of legal objections from producers). Waiting and hinting at next month allows for brokers and producers to recalibrate next month productions without facing increased risk of legal challenges to the governing body while mitigating the depressed price in oil.

a 510(K) approval is where you demonstrate that the device you are making is equivalent to some other device that the FDA has already approved. In this pathway you only need to prove that the device you make has the same functions and mechanism of action as the existing device for it to be approved.

&amp;#x200B;

For novel device approval, the FDA has never validated something like it before so you now have a significant burden to demonstrate to the FDA that the device is both safe and effective.

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 23, 2020 / Decision Diagnostics Corp. (OTC PINK:DECN) through its subsidiary Pharma Tech Solutions, Inc. the manufacturers and design specifiers for the :15 GenViro! Professional Swift Kit for testing Covid-19 testing, today announced that it plans a second EUA submission for an individual home testing version of the GenViro! Swift Kit for home testing. Decision Diagnostics is an 18-year old, diabetes and now infectious disease testing bio-technology development firm, high-level manufacturer, quality plan administrator, FDA registered medical device customer support organization, and exclusive worldwide sales and regulatory process agent for its own proprietary regulated medical devices.

In addition to the announcement of its home testing submissions, the company is also providing an update today on several other critical business objectives and milestones. Our GenViro! Covid-19 test kit is currently in the FDA EUA review process (more about this below). We have received the Pre-EUA Acknowledgement letter from the U.S. FDA for device (serial number) PEUA200232, GenViro Covid-19 Screening Kit. In the next week we plan to ask the FDA through counsel, as other companies have, for a conditional but immediate EUA approval subject only to completion of testing. This conditional approval will replace the Pre-EUA designation and allow the company to begin large scale preparation of kits.

Fresh New Look, Same Delicious Taste
FDA Emergency Waiver (EUA) Progress

As previously stated, we were granted a Pre-UEA (PEUA) by the U.S. FDA on April 4, 2020, PEUA200323, for our GenViro! :15 Swift kit for the testing of Covid-19. The PUEA is the formal notification from the FDA that a file (product) is under review for EUA clearance, that a reviewer has been assigned, and that testing protocols have been exchanged.

Subsequent to this grant, we have had two long conversations with FDA staff and management, the first of these discourses between our FDA counsel and FDA staff, the second conversation, on April 14, 2020, between our FDA counsel, DECN management and DECN technical and product development professionals. The purpose of these calls was to clarify and differentiate our GenViro! Swift kit, Pro Version, from the myriad of antibody/antigen methodologies that our product has been inaccurately compared to, primarily in public, but not scientific forums.


Discussions with FDA staff and management have focused on the differences inherent to our Genviro! Swift product, those differences that add to GenViro!'s value in use. For example the FDA is concerned with reagent and sample contaminants that may be present during testing, primarily because the samples taken from a patient using current methods must travel from the site of the patient to a laboratory for assay. This travel at times takes hours, sometimes days. GenViro! Swift does not make use of any reagent to provide a result. Therefore there will be no sample contaminant. Also, the patient sample it makes use of, a small drop of blood, does not have to travel. In fact the assay and answer are provided on the spot, in 15 seconds, right in front of the patient. We believe we have completed discussions and have come to an understanding with the FDA on all of the testing required to receive the EUA. We plan to engage a specialty reference laboratory to complete this testing in the next 10 days. Testing should take about a week.

On April 13, 2020 the company engaged a publicist and a lobbyist. The publicist has engaged three media outlets, who have shown great interest in the story of GenViro! Swift and want to interview DECN CEO Berman. One has already run a short introductory description of the product and is preparing a longer, more involved segment and has already accepted a number of visuals from us for the report. It is interesting to note that the media outlets are well versed in Covid-19 testing methods and are excited about GenViro! Swift not just for its promise but also because it is so different and so much faster to report than other methods currently available.

In addition, the company's lobbyist has engaged several influential members of Congress who have spoken at length with the company and its representatives. The Congressmen have agreed to carry the ball on behalf of the company, beginning with direct communication with the Pence Covid-19 Task Force. This process began on April 20. The company's goal for GenViro! is not just to receive EUA approval from the FDA, but when this approval is received, to become the go-to testing solution, in demand by Professional organizations as well as Fortune 500 companies, even sports teams.

New markets for our GenViro! have also been recently identified, the latest -- large businesses, Fortune 500 companies, seeking to reopen for business in the next month or two. This is perfect timing for the availability of kits. Some of these businesses have already contacted the company and even tried to place large purchase orders for GenViro! Swift kits, using the first in line principal, so that they may test and retest returning employees. No other test kit can accomplish this. The company has also accepted inquiries from restaurant chains and drinking establishments -- places where people congregate. We believe an outgrowth of this new market will be that off-duty nurses, medical technologists licensed to draw blood, and off duty pharmacists will be in large demand. The company has even been contacted by a sports franchise/league for the testing of players and ticket holders.

GenViro! for At-home (Individual) Use

Our original plan for GenViro! was to offer a single kit containing two PFUs (user's guide), one for Professional Use, one for at-home individual use. Otherwise, the contents of the kits were identical --- 3-test strips, 5-lancets, 1-check strip. However, as March moved into April it became clear that the FDA was not approving individual at-home use kits. So in order to move its application along within the EUA review system, DECN removed all of the description and data owing to the individual at-home kit. And now we bring it back -- by demand.

On April 21, 2020 the FDA approved an at-home sample collection device for Covid-19 testing, allowing individuals to purchase the collection kits, collect their own samples and then use the mails or other package service to deliver the sample to a laboratory for assay. Oftentimes government moves slowly, but they also tend to build large doors and then open them. DECN views this as an opportunity to become the first company to provide an all-in-one, immediate result, individual at-home Covid-19 test kits with its GenViro! Swift kit for at-home use. We intend to file our stand-alone EUA application for the individual use GenViro! Swift kit by May 1. We anticipate the application to include data gleaned from our GenViro Professional kit application. We also anticipate a request to direct us to conduct a donor study of a modest group of donors. We have already identified a group in Pennsylvania to make use of the Genviro! Swift Home kit. Additional testing required for this kit is anticipated to take less than a week.

Unanticipated Large Response from Large Corporations

A question that has been on everyone's mind has been how will America go back to work. On April 20, the company engaged Universal Response LLC to manage the sales we expect from the transitioning of the country from shelter in place guidance to a back to work environment. Customers that the company has been introduced to are ready to place orders.

The key will be to test, as best as possible and on the spot, employees returning to work while at the same time providing individuals with a way they can test themselves for the virus at home. Employees and individuals testing at home and at work is a remedy for controlling the impact of the virus. Current testing methods simply do not meet the requirements that will be necessary for employees to keep themselves safe and also allow employers to keep their businesses up and running. Without immediate results, testing just won't work the way it must.

PharmaTech Solutions GenViro! ""Swift Kit"" testing kit will provide the quick answers individuals and employers need. It provides results on the spot with no delay. While the FDA assesses how to move forward with this technology, the company is moving to work with a large health care products distributor who has already received requests for the GenViro! Swift kits. Outlets ranging from Fortune 50 corporations to professional sports leagues have shown strong interest. The company estimates it will be asked to produce 1 million ""Swift Kits"" per month through the end of the year just for the ""back to work"" markets, based on the rapidly building demand.

1538,School_IT_Hero,focvv4q,/r/pennystocks/comments/g6tmy4/pctl_train/focvv4q/,1,"Due to the guidelines established by federal, state and local governments limiting physical contact and promoting social distancing as result of the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the Registrant has evaluated its ongoing effort to prepare and file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. This evaluation has led to the conclusion that the Registrant expects to be unable to compile and review certain information required in order to permit the Registrant to file a timely and accurate Annual Report on Form 10-K for its year ended December 31, 2019, by the prescribed date without unreasonable effort or expense due to circumstances related to COVID-19.

 

Accordingly, we have decided to rely on the SEC Order and endeavor to file the **Annual Report no later than May 14, 2020, or within 45 days after the Original Due Date.** The reason the Form 10-K cannot be filed timely does not relate to the inability of any person, other than the Company, to furnish any required opinion, report, or certification.

Social distancing measures have been taken by both the Registrant‚Äôs outside accountants and its independent registered public accounting firm in order to protect the health of their employees. Further, travel restrictions have delayed certain inventory audit procedures and other items required for the annual audit. All of the foregoing has slowed the accounting and auditing work required to compile and audit the Registrant‚Äôs financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to be included the Annual Report.

""The SEC does not issue a suspension lightly, and the fact that they did in this case supports my belief that there is some credibility to the question of fraud. However, my belief doesn't matter, and if you believe the SEC was in the wrong, good for you. The fact remains the same - the stock is now almost certainly worthless.

Here's why. An SEC suspension is a near death sentence for OTC stocks. While the stock is suspended, it will be delisted and move to what's called the Grey Market. Sure, after the suspension is lifted trading can resume, but buyers and sellers will not be able to see what the bid/ask prices, meaning, you're trading blind. If you're selling, you list the stock at whatever price you think there is a buyer for and hope for the best. And, that's IF your broker even honors your order to sell, which they are not obliged to do. Indeed, your broker may just stop listing the stock altogether. The vast majority of SEC suspended stocks that resume trading on the grey market eventually die out""",2020-04-23

I've been there. I blew up on a penny stock when I was 23 hoping to get rich off a big move. Now I'm 35 and consistently make profits trading options based on the underlying supply and demand. Do I win every trade? Hell nah. Anyone that says they do is full of shit, a penny stock financier, or is a king of pump and dumps on Ihub.

No, I don't have a discord. No, I don't run a service. No, I don't have ads on my blog. 

I make my money trading.

edit:

Originally, they were purely focused on at-home kits. The game plan eventually evolved into 3 different products. While they still planned to only develop an at-home test, the initial projection was late Q3 (late summer). As thing progressed, their main focus became POC tests, which are, and have been projected to arrive pre-summer/may.

4. A simple rehash of everything that's been PR'd before? Probably tanks back down to .20 range or lower.

All of this is pure guesswork and at the end of the day, NO ONE KNOWS.

That said, even if DECN tanks, I would sell, and then buy back in when I am comfortable with the price. Its good as a longer hold so don't panic if you miss your window to sell if it does go down. Just be patient and wait for the next PR window.

2347,B-walker38,foar79l,/r/pennystocks/comments/g6df6q/nat/foar79l/,1,"(skip to second paragraph for my take on NAT) 

Personally I would say no to investing. I look at the 52 week range and trend charts for stocks I invest in. I've personally had the most luck with reviewing the 52 week range,and investing when the current value is on the ""low end"" of the scale. As an example I'm currently invested in ZSAN (52 week low is $0.405 --- high is $4.15) the current value is $0.69 and I bought in at $0.55. Yes I've made a $0.14 profit per share, could continue to go up or could go down. In theory though I've got much more potential for the value to continue to go up, than I do for it to go down. I personally can't afford to drop hundreds let alone thousands of dollars into investing like some people are able to, so I try to stick with true pennystocks staying under $1 to maximize my shares per deposit.

Looking at the 52 week range for NAT (I use TD Ameritrade) the current value is at $5.23 and the 52 week max is shown as $5.80 (which was just 2 days ago) KEEP IN MIND that is not a forecast for the future, just the previous 52 weeks. 

Looking at the charts, NAT hasn't touched over $6 per share since July 2017 and the and hasn't been over $10 per share since October 2016. The possibility is always there for potential gains, but it will also come down to how much are you willing to invest. 

Lets say you invest $1000 at the current value of $5.23 you would get 191 shares. You decide to sell at $7.50 (if it gets that high) BOOM you made $432 but keep in mind you'll have to pay taxes on your gains once you withdraw, come tax season, and certain trading apps take a percentage or a whole dollar amount from higher value trades. That $432 could end up being only $375 after fees and taxes. YES THAT'S STILL PROFIT BUT THAT IS IF THE VALUE CONTINUES UPWARD.",2020-04-23

2349,whiterhinoqueef,foar9qc,/r/pennystocks/comments/g6n4de/decn_opinion_hold_or_sell_after_news/foar9qc/,1,A stop order is where if it reaches that price then it becomes a market order. So if you set it at say .37 you aren‚Äôt necessarily going to sell it at .37. A stop limit would be where it becomes a limit order to whatever you set if it hits the stop price.

Oftentimes government moves slowly, but they also tend to build large doors and then open them. DECN views this as an opportunity to become the first company to provide an all-in-one, immediate result, individual at-home Covid-19 test kits with its GenViro! Swift kit for at-home use. We intend to file our stand-alone EUA application for the individual use GenViro! Swift kit by May 1. We anticipate the application to include data gleaned from our GenViro Professional kit application. We also anticipate a request to direct us to conduct a donor study of a modest group of donors. We have already identified a group in Pennsylvania to make use of the Genviro! Swift Home kit. Additional testing required for this kit is anticipated to take less than a week.""",2020-04-23

Let‚Äôs say your income is at the federal poverty level (12k/yr) and you can save 2% of that in an investment account ($240/yr). Let‚Äôs also assume that you‚Äôre Warren Fucking Buffet and can constantly return 30% per year.

After 5 years you‚Äôd have $2700, of which $1440 would be contributions and $1000 would be gains.

Now, if instead of investing you work an extra hour per week at the federal minimum wage of 7.25 per hour and added that to your $240/yr savings for a total of $617/yr you‚Äôd hit the $2700 mark in only 4 years and 4 months. And that‚Äôs guaranteed income rather than assuming you can triple the market average every year.

So at that level of buying power you could be an absolute savant of investing and you‚Äôd still lose to the guy who picked up an extra hour at McDonalds each week.
