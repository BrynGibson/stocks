# Banks –

**Chase:**

Chase bank is a Fortune 500 company that will pay you a **$200** bonus for opening a checking account with a referral link and making a **direct deposit of** **any amount (EVEN JUST $1).**

A ""direct deposit"" is money that is deposited into your account directly from your employer’s payroll. If you do not receive these, I suggest doing a few minutes of work on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowd-work platform and having your earnings sent to your Chase account via direct deposit.

[https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/1805179865](https://accounts.chase.com/raf/share/1805179865)

**Stash:**

Stash is giving out $20 to anyone that signs up for the Stash (bank) or Stash Invest account via my referral link and deposits at least $5 from any source (payroll, another bank account, paypal, etc.) So all you have to do is open an account with a referral link, deposit $5, and then the bonus will post to your account!

The app will ask you to open a paid account, but you can simply open a ""beginner"" account for $1 a month, and then close your account after 1 month after you get your $20 bonus.

[https://get.stashinvest.com/anton\_690shzk](https://get.stashinvest.com/anton_690shzk)

**Chime:**

Chime is a banking app that pays you a $50 bonus for making a direct deposit of at least $200. There is no catch, and you can close the account at any time fee free as soon as you register their debit card (gotta wait a few days to get it in the mail).

A ""direct deposit"" technically means that they want you to deposit the money right from payroll, but you can actually meet this requirement simply by transferring in $200 from CASH APP! So you could deposit $200 into cash app, then withdraw that $200 into chime and get the $50 bonus!

If you don't have cash app, you can also transfer in $200 from the following banks to fulfill the same requirements- Ally, Charles Schwab, Chase, Circle Pay App, Discover, Hancock Whitney, Huntington, PNC, Serve, TD Bank, USAA, US Bank, Wells Fargo.

[https://member.chime.com/join/antonmcclinton](https://member.chime.com/join/antonmcclinton)

**Qapital:**

Qapital is a banking app that pays you a $20 bonus for making at least a $20 deposit from any source. You need to set up a savings goal and a rule to automatically transfer funds to Qapital (One easy option would be to set up a $5 weekly transfer so that you can quickly qualify for the bonus). They have a monthly fee (Qapital Basic is $3/month; Qapital Complete is $6/month; and Qapital Master is $12/month.) which is waived for the first month.

If you keep your account open for 45 days, maintain a $20 account balance, and make 1 membership payment, they will credit you with a $20 account bonus. You can then immediately close the account and take your deposit + the bonus out with no additional charges.

 I bought some shares in ALT ($1000), KTOV (made on order to buy on Monday with a limit of $0.6), and CLIS (made order for monday) . for a sum of $3500.

I would like to invest on a weekly basis so not DD, a few hours a week with some stop/limits options for when i am not following the trend. 

do you guy have any advice for me? I have no finance background so i find it hard to start reading about those, can I do well if i follow news and forums(like this one on reddit)? any mentors worth following? so i can copy what they do for a while till i learn?

also I heard good things and read positive news about HYSR, ICLK and SSFT any one have an idea about these three and their potentiel?

Now if any of you have read my previous comments about the *ahem* size of my portfolio, you know it is not sizable. Its about $270 right now if I sold everything off at closing prices, so about $250 or so come Monday. I've gotten my initial investment out already so this is just spare cash. 

Whats my point you may be asking, why am I writing this? I want to try to increase that money as much as possible before weeks end, and then let it settle and pull it out next Monday. My plan is to do this with options. Now I havent traded options before and I have a tenuous grasp on them at best, but I know that if I make the right decisions on the right stocks I can make a quite a bit of money on them. Thats where you come in.

I'm beginning my penny stock journey and currently building stats and a playbook based on manual backtesting. Anyone interested to collaborate on research and share notes? 

**I'm looking for traders who are:**

* Motivated, doing this full time or at least 4 hours a day.
* Experienced, has read and learned enough that you don't require much elaboration on new concepts
* Disciplined to be able to commit and deliver a certain amount of output each week. 

**About my experience:**

I've day traded for a year in 2007 and wasn't really able to make anything of it. Found out it was not for me. Been learning forex the past 2 years and finally been profitable to make my living off of it the past few months, solely from trading EURUSD. 

I have a programming background but has since retired from coding. I know technical analysis and how to use it properly. Some fundamental analysis but dont need to use it for this purpose.  I also know that risk management is paramount in this business and I'm that point where I'm confident of my ability to make money in the markets no matter what. 

I'm diving into the penny stock arena because it provides a very good way to make another stream of trading income that is uncorrelated.

My preferred method is to swing these pennies for 1 day to 1 week and use intraday patterns for tighter entries and better risk reward. 

I research and backtest by going through each breakout in each ticker one by one for the past X years, saving those intraday patterns in a Google Doc. I also note down statistics related to each breakout in a Google Sheet. 

I need help in building this database to gain confidence in the patterns and therefore build an edge. There are a lot of tickers and by dividing the work we can get there 10x faster and share the results among ourselves. 

My goal is to turn $25,000 into $1,000,000 in a year or two. 

If interested, please DM me your current situation.",2020-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gldxv0/study_and_trading_group_to_turn_25000_into_1000000/

49,Look out for IZEA tomorrow,gljyk7,spl1sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gljyk7/look_out_for_izea_tomorrow/,1,61,"IZEA is a company that basically connects influencers and brands, so both parties benefit from each other.

Even though their earnings were not good at the earnings report, the CEO Ted Murphy was very optimistic about the future.

*""In mid-April, we began to see a remarkable resurgence of bookings.... As of today, the 14-day average bookings trendline is now above our 14-day Pre COVID-19 average and we are gaining momentum.""*

*"" I hope you can join me next Monday for the BrandGraph streaming event. We built some pretty incredible technology there. You've got to see it for yourself.* ""

So people panic sold to .50 even though he said the bookings were better? And there is a event Monday showcasing their product they've been hyping up?

At Monday, 2pm-3pm EST (5/18) there will be a demo showcasing their new product BrandGraph

**According to this** article **the demo will showcase:**

\- An overview of the BrandGraph platform

\- A demonstration of the BrandGraph Trends feature and key insights it has revealed during the pandemic

\- A competitive analysis of two leading brands, showcasing their relative influencer performance, share of voice, and engagement analysis

This isn't an upcoming earnings or conference call where there is risk of bad news. This demo can be nothing but good news, I don't understand why people would dump before the demo, it can literally only go up from this demo.

The CEO also tweeted that the new Scooby Doo movie got 2 billion views thanks to their IZEA campaign.

[https://twitter.com/tedmurphy/status/1258830050209734658?s=20](https://twitter.com/tedmurphy/status/1258830050209734658?s=20)

My prediction is that this will rise to .8 or .9 in anticipation of the demo, but will have a dip due to profit takers/herd mentality, and then EOD will be 1$+. They need to reach 1$ by August or else they'll be removed from the Market

**Even if you doubt me, this is no doubt easy profit if you get in under .7, just get out whenever you feel comfortable.**

51,My new trading strategy,gljl5p,Fileobrother,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gljl5p/my_new_trading_strategy/,1,35,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how I made profit off of companies like MVIS and UAVS and how after I got out, I had FOMO and bought back in at a higher price and sold at a loss, which cancelled out most of my profit. 

I’ve been trading since the beginning of April, and in that time, I’m up 31% on my initial investment. I see this as a positive, if not a bit of a waste since I squandered a lot of potential over the last two weeks with emotional trading. 

Some of the issues I’ve fallen prey to:
1)Buying in PM Monday from PR the previous week. 

2)Holding til Friday and everyone drops the stock like a hot potato. 

3)Investing too much of my portfolio into one stock and feeling like I’m down too much to sell. 

4)Getting caught up in the possibility of a huge upside that turned out to be a pipe dream. 

Here are my thoughts on rules for my new strategy. 


1)A max of 10% of my portfolio in one stock at a time. Max of 5 at a time. 

2) Buy on Monday afternoon/Tuesday morning with a 5% stop loss and a 30% take profit. 

3) On Thursday afternoon, if the stock hasn’t sold, I will sell it no matter what. 

4) Only buy into tickers that haven’t run more than 50% in the last 10 days. 

5) If I hit stop loss on more than 2 tickers in a week, I take a week off to reevaluate my buying parameters. 

In this way, I ensure that in a week, I lose no more than 2.5% of my portfolio value, and limit my upside to 15%.

15% return *every* week is probably not realistic. If I did this every week for three years, assuming a median profit take of 6.25%, I could turn $175 into $2.1 million. 

Obviously, it wouldn’t be a completely random distribution, but if I do my DD on each company, following the volume and only buying if it hits a number I’m comfortable with, I think this could be a good strategy. It also keeps me from looking at my account every few minutes.

It's frustrating, because so many are shills and they're all working together to pump up shit stocks.

These include buysellshort,StanTheTradingMan etc. Some people are fine I believe Zack Morris is genuine, and the whole atlas team.

Let me explain.

""BuySellShort"" has been fined by the SEC in the past for basically pumping up worthless stocks, and dumping them on people.

this is all proof here

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/33-10344.pdf

What these two are doing is they would pump up a worthless stock like KMPH, OR TUES, and once all their followers buy it, they short the living shit out of it. Triggering stop losses, and overall screwing it up.

Many of these fake gurus exist, and they're all over, but they're yet to be caught by the SEC like BuySellShort.

(Amazon Prime, Netflix, Apple, Roku, Comcast and many more) However, their channel will not be subscription base but rather with ads. 

Here is why I believe they made the correct decision:

1) The last thing any consumer needs right now is another subscription cost being deducted from their bank account on a monthly/yearly basis. Especially during these troubled times!

2a) The key demographic that will be watching the shows, I presume 8yrs old and younger, don’t care if ads are televised because they want to see what mom &amp; dad can buy them. Which leads me to 2b

2b) Kartoon Channel will be able to market their products directly to the key demographic, kids, who then ask parents to purchase said marketed product. What kid wouldn’t want the toy/character of the show they are watching and love. Or, the cereal that has their favorite shows character on it? What’s the cost to GNUS if they market their own kids lines on their own dedicated channel? I’m guessing nil to little. 

3) GNUS has already established they have deals with main toy producer Mattel. Also, connections with main retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Target) to sell their toys. Any guesses on what manufacture’s toys I anticipate to be advertised? Or, retailers I anticipate those ads to be running?

It seems to me, as long as they have the viewership, which I don’t think will be an issue as it’s free to watch, they will have a consistent review stream from their ads &amp; merchandise. 

That’s a win/win in my book.

The only question remaining, do the little ones want to watch their content???  TBD",2020-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glnchy/gnus_ads_vs_subscription_why_i_think_they_made/

80,$GNUS - A gold mine for June,glor9x,benjamin_ngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glor9x/gnus_a_gold_mine_for_june/,1,50,"My story: I bought $GNUS at 0.95 before it run up after 3-4 hours, and sold in next day pre-market section at 1.31. After GNUS conference call on 15 May, I jump  into GNUS again at 1.74 after a spike. It dropped a lot before the market close. 

But I still optimistic because of their new channel Kartoon Network. Here’s why:

Kartoon Channel is a free, no subscription fee with fully ad supporting digital channel for kids 2-11 years old to. KC has over 4,000 episodes of premium entertaining and educational content anytime, anywhere in a safe environment. It’s like Netflix-for-kids for sure.

IMO, I absolutely believe they’ll advertise their new channel before they launch on June 15 to the public at the end of May or begin of June. Many daytrader and investors are going to jump in this boat. The price at that time can be $2++ (Now, the resistance of $GNUS is around $1.85-$1.9).

On June 15, KC will be launched on many huge platform like Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Comcast, Cox, SelectTV, DISH, Sling TV, Tubi, Xumo, etc... According to GNUS press release, they estimated that KC can reach 100mil TV users and 200mil over-the-air users (included mobile device). KC can easily be accessed because it’s free. Also, June is summer time and with current coronavirus epidemic, all of kids are staying at home. It leads to the amount of audience and attention from public to KC are huge AF. This makes $GNUS has a gaining round again.

Beside KC, GNUS has many deals with Mattel, Hasbro,... to make toys and content. (I’m still not DD detail this so I can’t say much).

Patience is a key. If you don’t want to lose any profit from it, don’t sell it. Take this chance and don’t let anyone take it. Buy more from $GNUS dip in next week because there are so many chances.

*I’m not pump this up. KC is a real thing and I based on real thing to write this post, not on any rumors.",2020-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glor9x/gnus_a_gold_mine_for_june/
81,ONTX who's in?,glomt2,FatalComplex111,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glomt2/ontx_whos_in/,1,13,"They have a phase 3 trial going on targeting leukemia, already with pre approval partnerships throughout Europe and Asia giving early access to higher risk patients, pending approval of course. 

Earnings report on the 14th looked pretty good. Trading at 3x avg volume. Sabby just exited

***This isn't very thorough DD so definitely do your own.***

*** Potential Catalysts &amp; Upcoming events***:

- Virtual shareholders meeting on May 27th

- I saw something on stocktwits regarding 2 scientific presentations and a big conference in December. On their website all I could see was a presentation that was in June and December of last year, but as both are Annual events I'm sure they will happen again this year as well. 

- Approval of FDA fast tracking, and approval for their treatment(which has been promising so far)

***Potential Downsides***:

- I saw something about an R/S on stocktwits but like I said I havent researched too thoroughly. 

Just wondering if anyone has more knowledge on this company and can offer their insight.",2020-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glomt2/ontx_whos_in/

from our product research, user interviews, and engaging with communities like these, we've found that there are a number of concerns with existing investing services

1. they skip over the process of learning to invest, resulting in users losing money
2. of those that do provide educational resources, there is no opportunity to directly implement that knowledge into real investing experience
3. most of them are designed for individuals, young consumers like the idea of trading alongside their friends!

we're thinking of only having a couple of forums at the beginning. if you were first starting to invest, what topics do you think would be important to learn?

is this something you would use? message me with your thoughts!",2020-05-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/glo84l/harvardmit_students_building_an_investing_social/
