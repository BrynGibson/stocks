NEW YORK, NY, June 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE – [Amarantus Bioscience Holdings, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OuXLyNMqXrUispAn2gAHwC1UtCjUzEHh19m_PWmGMoSbHixkaY8QFozmipkHkhlm36-QeLpaxz1dn2JY7_-do5NsVtKFvZUhmXFcFs2ShsLZXdJomdLrHqkhvwr1yaqg). (OTC Pink: AMBS) (the “Company,” or AMBS), a US-based JLABS-alumnus biotechnology holding company developing proprietary orphan neurologic, regenerative medicine and ophthalmic therapies and diagnostics through its subsidiaries, today announced that it has entered into a Letter of Intent (‘LOI’) with [The Alchemist’s Kitchen](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RZTyBRI0Vk5xNIm6IgNdbWLP6XIw9cIHAV8luINkb1kP2iVVtcwj1V4OcG0wVVilHQ4bCzabj5zRetC7oW80p4WAZjslU-FguKhMI372BbU-Xf9Yy1Ghh5ZtO4JdTSIA), a plant-based wellness company marketing the Plant Alchemy brand of health and wellness products, to establish a joint venture for commercialization of hemp based herbal smokable products ‘Herbal Smokes’ in addition to conducting research for cannabinoid derived addiction treatment, including smoking cessation (tobacco and vaping-based/e-cigarette), and other indications such as insomnia (the ‘Evolver Herbal Smokes’ or the ‘JV’). The initial equity ownership of Evolver Herbal Smokes will be 19.99% for Amarantus, and 80.01% for The Alchemist’s Kitchen and/or its affiliates. Amarantus will have the right to acquire the remaining 80.01% equity of Evolver Herbal Smokes in conjunction with the listing of its common shares onto a national stock exchange.

“We are excited about the prospect of working with Amarantus to gain clinical data on our existing hemp smokable products, as well as evaluate  various formulations and other differentiating factors that could optimize the use of hemp and herbal smokable products for a wide range of medical conditions,” said Louis Sagar, CEO of The Alchemist’s Kitchen. “Bringing scientific and clinical focus on the smokable product line via the Evolver Herbal Smokes joint venture with Amarantus will potentially create significant value for our brand by adding clinical data to our offering, potentially significantly growing the user base for Plant Alchemy products.”

“Cigarette and e-cigarettes have established themselves as highly addictive products that the FDA has recognized as having significant risks for the health of consumers,” said Gerald E. Commissiong, President &amp; CEO of Amarantus. “Based upon the large body of anecdotal evidence available in the literature and other mediums, smokable hemp products appear to have the greatest reliability as it relates to delivery of cannabinoids to the brain, including CBD, as well as an historical anecdotal safety profile that presents itself as potentially favorable compared to cigarettes and e-cigarettes.  We believe it is an important public health concern to evaluate the potential for hemp smokable products to potentially disrupt the cigarette and e-cigarette market based upon clinically validated medical claims. The Alchemist’s Kitchen has established itself as the leading destination in New York City for ultra-premium, plant-based health &amp; wellness products, including hemp-based smokable products. As Amarantus ventures into the legal hemp industry, we believe it is critical to collaborate with ‘best-in-breed’ partners who can consistently deliver the highest quality products and Evolver Herbal Smokes certainly fits that description.”

Under the terms of the agreement, The Alchemist’s Kitchen’s ‘Plant Alchemy’ brand, an ultra-premium brand of health &amp; wellness products that include federally legal hemp derived cannabidiol (CBD) products, will be the brand used for the products produced from the joint venture. The Alchemist’s Kitchen is currently selling Plant Alchemy hemp-based smokable products out of their flagship storefront in the Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York, and will contribute that currently selling Plant Alchemy smokable product line to the JV. Amarantus will contribute capital to the JV, will deploy its clinical development expertise and work closely with The Alchemist’s Kitchen to conduct clinical research on the use of the Herbal Smokes. The objective of the JV is to engage highly motivated consumers to participate in the necessary clinical development that will accelerate the path to claim-based hemp-derived products with the Food &amp; Drug Administration. Ultimately, the objective is to create products that have been rigorously tested so that the JV can make medical claims regarding the benefits of Herbal Smokes products vs. other forms of smokable or inhalable products.",2019-06-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c5b9i0/ambs_amarantus_enters_into_letter_of_intent_with/

DENVER, Colorado, June 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vaxa Global, LLC. announced that it has entered into a farm management agreement with Monteverde Partners LLC to farm and manage industrial hemp production on 158 acres on Two Rivers Water and Farming Company’s (OTCQB:TURV) Butte Valley Farm in Walsenburg, Colorado. The agreement will pave the way for expanded production in 2020 for over 1000 additional acres of rich farmland in Southern Colorado owned by Two Rivers. This pilot project is expected to produce over one-quarter of a million pounds of CBD-rich flower for distribution to customers and internal uses.

Along with Monteverde as a current shareholder of Vaxa Global, the Monteverde alliance brings large scale processing and extraction capabilities within direct proximity to the Vaxa farming operations and allows Vaxa the ability to generate a higher value from its harvest in the form of hemp-derived CBD isolate sales.

The Monteverde alliance positions the Companies to stay at the forefront of farming practices and techniques of industrial hemp in the U.S. Monteverde has successfully grown and produced high quality hemp-CBD genetics with the purpose to produce a stable and consistent source of hemp-CBD for this rapidly expanding market.

In 2018, the market value for CBD-rich flower achieved prices in excess of $50 per pound for high-quality CBD biomass. This announcement marks the beginning of an aggressive farming and agriculture expansion for the high-volume production of CBD-rich biomass and the future global opportunities it holds for the Company.

*“Through our partnership with Monteverde, we have successfully sourced several specialized genetic varieties that will allow us to propagate and expand our proprietary seed bank for future growth into the burgeoning smokable market for hemp” said Greg Harrington, spokesperson for Vaxa Global.*

Currently, (Two Rivers owns/Vaxa Global has rights to) a total of irrigatable land of 2,372 acres and owns a total of 6,265 acres, and senior water rights in Southern Colorado. Additionally, The Company is expected to increase its land holdings along the Huerfano River basin and utilize its vast water rights to lease and purchase additional acres of high-quality farmland for the purpose of growing high-quality CBD genetics.

*""This farm management arrangement further demonstrates the upside potential to our farms,"" said Mr. Harrington. ""We continue to focus on developing multiple revenue streams for the water rights and farms we own in order to increase returns for our stockholders.""* 

Cannabis research firm Brightfield Group estimates that the U.S. market for hemp-derived CBD hit $291 million in 2017 and will balloon to $1.65 billion by 2021 – growth of more than 500% in just four years.",2019-06-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c5dcx5/turv_vaxa_global_and_two_rivers_water_and_farming/
