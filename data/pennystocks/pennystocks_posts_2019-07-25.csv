Corporate Executive Chef Douwe Iedema is featured in both videos as he explains that ‚Äúany chef would dream to work with this product.‚Äù¬† He explains it is ‚Äúgood, clean, fresh and natural.¬† It‚Äôs very promising for next year.‚Äù 

Mr. Iedema has more than twenty years of demonstrated success directing the operations of large restaurants and large events. He trained as a Culinary Chef in the Netherlands and received his Master of Arts in Classic French Cuisine.

Mr. Iedema has stressed: ¬†‚ÄúNo shrimp can be compared with ours. The word natural says it all. Our shrimp are sweet, buttery and clean. This is the way shrimp should taste. All white Pacific shrimp have a sweetness to them ‚Äì ours a little more,‚Äù said Mr. Iedema.

In the videos, NaturalShrimp‚Äôs Chef explains how to cook the shrimp, which the Company brought to the exclusive, well attended show.¬† 

This was the 83rd year for what is the largest foodservice show in the Southeast, noted as a powerful and dynamic marketing platform.¬† ‚ÄúWe are pleased by our attendance and pleased by the reception we received and the people we meet,‚Äù said Gerald Easterling, NaturalShrimp President.

NATURAL SHRIMP, INC. is a publicly traded Aquaculture Company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, with production facilities located near San Antonio, Texas. The Company has developed the first commercially viable system for growing shrimp in enclosed, salt water systems, using patented technology to produce fresh, never frozen, naturally grown shrimp without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. NaturalShrimp systems can be located anywhere in the world to produce gourmet-grade Pacific white shrimp.

**The small South American nation is home to some of the most under explored opportunities in the** [**precious metals**](https://investingnews.com/category/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/) **space, but Guyana gold is no longer a secret.**¬†

The country sits on the Guyana Shield, a geographical region that shares continuity with the famed gold districts of West Africa, and yet the country has been historically under explored compared to its counterpart on the other side of the globe. Now, with gold values [nearing a six year high](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/gold-investing/will-gold-break-us1400/) as of June 2019, miners in the Co-operative Republic of Guyana have an opportunity to unlock significant value in this highly prospective region.

Now the gas side, thats why their launching the Taronis Fuels spinoff to break off their fuel business name from Tech business.

If you never heard of Taronis right? And magnegas was still magnegas. If you heard about taronis thinking magnegas and taronis were 2 different companies. 

You would shit on Magnegas more than taronis, because to our knowledge(most of us, not me im Pro TRNX) towards magnegas is negative.

So focus on the tech side of TRNX if you are a hater. Focus on the fuel side and tech side if your a long holder. They have 3 weeks to reach $1 by aug15. Then they have to hold that $1 price for 20 trading days.

With recent accomplishments and volume and stock rising and news,(all my targets were right in previous TRNX posts by the way) Nyse might extend their period by early August, my guess is August 12th monday. 

Curreny week low target is .42, high .70, average dont buy past .50(like ive been saying forever)

Update as well: i sold all 2500 shares for a few BYND option calls. Going to average the initial 2500 shares back in. Until aug15. Why 2500? Because if they do do a R/s then it'll likely be 1-25 split. Because once a year splits at 1-10/1-15/1-20 since 2017
