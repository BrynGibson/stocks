AYTU - 430% ish
IBIO - 690%
CODX - 1300%
INO - 164%
OPK - 66%
DECN - 850%

DECN has already made an impressive 850%... if it were to hit .30 that's already 1500%... saying this could go to $1 would be a 5000% increase roughly (i'm rounding to 0.02 which is the low of the price before it started moving up).. which is fucking crazy 

Keep in mind all of these stock prices faded right after these huge spikes and most of them didn't have another rally and the ones that did have another rally didn't manage break through the previous highs.. like AYTU which only pushed 60% even with FDA approval the stock didn't catapult to the moon because it was already overextended or CODX only 91% after the massive spike..

Just by comparing DECN to other stocks that have had insane price moves because of covid I can reasonably conclude that DECN is in its last stretch of price move or is at least getting close to it and why I have been saying that .35 is like the max it could possible go just with FDA EUA

now once they release their actual sales number (in a very long time from now) then we can reassess the ""TO THE $1 MOON BABY"" but for now it's looking like the stock is nearing the limit of its run...

It's not that I'm contradicting myself, it's that you can't follow a conversation.

DECN is not iBio or AYTU. It's a different company with a different pr team and different products.

* NY cases are sky rocketing and we're still early
* the entire country of India (1.3 billion) was just told to not leave their homes for 21 days
* consider the above bullet, then consider how Trump wants us to go back to work next week because we've already 'learned a lot'
* people wont be worrying about buying the next iPhone when their grandparents and parents are dying and cannot get medical care
* many restaurants are estimating a more than 50% drop in revenue even when including to-go and delivery
* unemployment may literally go to 20-30% and for every day the pandemic continues the number of surviving companies and jobs will decrease
* companies will **still** have to pay back the loans for the cheap money they get to stay afloat, it will still be on their balance sheets
* a $1000-$2000 stim shot is just enough for many people to pay rent and buy food let alone go shopping again when they just got laid off
* even though tens of thousands of people are going to die, congress still cant get along well enough to pass a bill
* pushes to open the economy in ""non hot zones"" will turn those zones into hot zones

My opinion is that this testing platform, with it's ease of use, speed, cost and portability will make it a prime choice for all non clinical testing. People afraid to use airlines - GenViro at TSA. Cruse ships? GenViro at the dock. Genentech wants to bring employees back to work, you get the idea.

Plus they're already selling through Walmart and 1000+ other retailers.

I've got 1150 shares invested in at $1.70 and $1.83. saw it climb to $2.18 the other day but didn't sale. Regret it now as that was $400 profit for me. I've been watching this stock get pumped and dumped since I started and it's only going to continue to do that imo while also gradually increasing it's baseline price. I've come to terms that the whole reason I got into this was to make some side money as I have a career. I've now lost out on $400 because I wanted to keep all my shares and was scared if I sold I'd miss out.

I learned my lesson and will be dropping these shares at today's peak if it's reasonable.and buy back when it drops. I've watched this stock enough to see it's pattern now. 

I also blindly bought 6600 shares of DECN for $1k. God knows what I got myself into. It hurt my soul to see it only being worth $785 today meaning I've lost over $200 on it. But not gonna panic and try to control myself and ride it out.",2020-03-24

Ideally in pre market if it went to 1.5 or 1.6 it would have gone to 2-3$+ imo. Shorts were underwater but the buying pressure wasn’t enough to bury them.

Their new product is tailored for adults with chronic lung diseases. It has a multi billion dollar market.

I was in on them at 0.35 ($5 after a reverse stock split). They went up over 150% one day earlier this year after a good data set came out. Sold out when the market started to tank and bought back in the day before the pump at $3 a share (lucky af).",2020-03-24

Investors aren’t scientists and scientists aren’t investors. Investors can’t dig through safety and efficacy data and say whether a company is worth 30m, 300m, or 3B and scientists can run the data but not the numbers. 

My point is BLPH has significant upside. Their play was never COVID. Yes they got a significant pump from it, but they could be a billion+ dollar company in the future without it (they already have, that’s why I said you probably don’t know their history). To be valued at 15m with their potential is crazy considering companies like WeWork are multi-billion dollar companies with no profitability in their future.",2020-03-24
