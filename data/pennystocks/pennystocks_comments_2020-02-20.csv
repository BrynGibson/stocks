Soon it's 10k, then 15k, at that point the severe depression kicks in and you stop looking at it, you fully go in denial. I logged in again and was -5$, not sure how that's possible.

They have some good resources, especially for options traders. TD Ameritrade has a better knowledge base for beginners for everything else, but I already learned E-Trade and the Power E-Trade platform, so that's where my money is staying for now.

If you go to the ""Knowledge"" tab on E-Trade, there are a bunch of resources. I also have found Investopedia to be very helpful. Investopedia actually offers some paid online courses, but I have not tried them yet.

The charts and studies on the Power E-Trade platform are extremely helpful. So, ya know - learn power ETrade. They also have a paper trading platform (real data, fake money). Pick any stock, go to ""Chart"" and make sure to turn on ""Indicators."" That should keep you busy for a long time. 

If I had been paying attention and not been sick this week, I could have easily made a couple hundred today by selling yesterday (when a bunch of studies indicated I should) and repurchasing today. 

I'm still very new. There are people with masters degrees and PhDs in this stuff, so, ya know - learn as much as you can.

One of the course presenters in the Knowledge base on E-Trade had some great advice that has stuck with me. Don't fall in love with a company. Fall in love with a chart pattern. 

There are lots of ways to profit. You can day trade, options trade, focus on dividends... depends on your risk tolerance. 

I started with no money and a high risk tolerance. My tolerance is more moderate now. What's been great for me - most beneficial for me - is that it's encouraged me to save more money each month to put into the market. I just spend less money now.",2020-02-20

As you learn more about stocks and options, and different strategies with each, and you learn the differences between value stocks, dividend stocks, etf’s, etc. you will start to identify different strategies that fit your style, and some will be long term strategies, some will be shorter term strategies, and it will become somewhat obvious which to employ in your income account, and which to employ in the retirement account.",2020-02-20

Have you back tested your strategy? You should be able to answer what your projected win/loss ratio will be, against what it actually is, as well as your projected vs actual risk/reward ratio, and that will tell you your projected and actual net returns.  

Often when people experience the outcomes you are, those are the critical first steps they haven’t yet taken. Those high risk/reward bets are enticing, and they can be a useful way to add some risk to a portfolio that is too conservative, if they are played shrewdly.
