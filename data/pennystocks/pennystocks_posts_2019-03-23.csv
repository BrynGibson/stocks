1,Looking for an experienced Mentor that can help me to learn the ropes of this trade.,b4pi56,deep_mann,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4pi56/looking_for_an_experienced_mentor_that_can_help/,24,25,"Hello All, Hope you are having a good day. I joined this stock game 3 months ago. Originally, I had some cash sitting in my bank and started investing in blue chip stocks as a source of second income. Few weeks in, i got really interested in the stock market and started researching some good stocks currently my portfolio is up  13% (beginners luck) .  I got caught up in the pump and dump scheme of $LPTX, thats when i realized that I am completely clueless on where to start and what to do when it comes to penny stocks. I am looking for someone who can help me to build a solid foundation and understanding of the market and teach me some tricks. If you feel that you can help me out, please feel free to PM me with any questions or concerns that you have. Thankyou.

3,Best Oscillators for day trading,b4dh3u,dusty_mtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4dh3u/best_oscillators_for_day_trading/,2,10,"Hey, As the title suggests... looking for peoples opinions on the better day trading technical analysis tools!

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty new to trading, and I am self teaching rather then dumping money into any of the wonderful pop up adds for classes and 'training'.  I'm sure they are valuable information none the less, but everyone has their own take on everything and I'd rather accumulate knowledge from many sources then 1 concentrated source.

&amp;#x200B;

So... Any thoughts on the best day trading oscillators? or any other tools that could be useful?",2019-03-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b4dh3u/best_oscillators_for_day_trading/
