4,Quick question,8whufv,Portue-Fortune,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8whufv/quick_question/,0,1,Where can I find penny stock sheets? ,2018-07-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8whufv/quick_question/
5,Watchlist + my $20k profit win,8whrzv,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8whrzv/watchlist_my_20k_profit_win/,0,11,"I'm sure many of you already have heard about my $20,157 profit on $GBR the other day. I posted this on social media, to my students and in some penny stock chat rooms.  The very next day I mentioned this stock, GBR shot up past the level of resistance I mentioned, just as anticipated. One of my strategies is that I trade primarily during the highly volatile ""primetime,"" which is the first 15-20 minutes of trading and the last hour of the trading session. I placed a buy order before the market closed setting my stop-loss where I said it would be a good stop-loss based on my exclusive divisible by 5 rule, and then I woke up the next morning to see that the stock jumped by over 100&amp;#37;!  


A lot of people bought the stock and held the next day, which resulted in a lot of losses. I know many of my students made money since it was my top stock pick of the day, yet the more inexperienced traders jumped in too late and couldn't understand why they lost money. Stop holding onto stocks. Remember, stocks generally run 1-4 trading days...that's IT! I also mention in my videos treat them like a one night stand, not a marriage. Dump it and move on to another more lucrative and volatile stock.  


ANW - Just like $GBR, I wouldn't go chasing this...especially since the stock gained over 200&amp;#37; in a single day. I can almost guarantee the stock will fall tomorrow...(not a 100&amp;#37; guarantee, but a very strong likelihood) based on my strategies ie climax patterns.  


DFBG - If this stock can surpass the previous resistance of $5.45, it will most likely continue to rise. I wouldn't invest in this stock, simply because it, too, is a climax pattern, and we all know what happens to those!  


CVRS - Just as I mentioned in my videos, when a stock is approaching $1, it creates a lot of hype/hope/faith, which can cause more demand, which creates a higher stock price, resulting in profits! Today it reached the $1 divisible by 5 rule. I would keep $1.15 and $1 as my price targets.  

PRAN - There seems to be a lot of resistance around the $2.45 level, so if the price can pierce this resistance, there's a potential buying opportunity here. If there is NOT enough demand, expect the price action to deteriorate.
