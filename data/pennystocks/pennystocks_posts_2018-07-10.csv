nDivision Inc. (NDVN) - cloud computing/enterprise IT

RealBiz Media (RBIZ) - real estate digital media (not touched on too much yet)

Bravatek (BVTK) - previous pump - cybersecurity

Premier Holding Corp (PRHL) - stop sign play - clean tech

LiqTech Intl (LIQT) - cleantech

UQM Technologies (UQM) - automotive tech 

Neuralstem Inc. (CUR) - Stem cell tech

ImageWare Systems (IWSY) - Identity tech
