0,Have you been trading for a long time but you couldn't make it yet ?,8ss3cb,Mr-Houssine,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ss3cb/have_you_been_trading_for_a_long_time_but_you/,0,15,"Have you been trading for a long time but you couldn't make it yet ?

Have you bought a lot of courses and tried a lot of strategies but none of them worked ?

If so you're in the right place and i'm not here to sell you anything

Hi my name is Houssine and i've been in the trading space for 4 years now, The first three years i was trading forex but i didn't 
succeed and then i get into trading stocks in the fourth year and i've been trading in demo account for a long time and then i become a profitable stock trader thank god.

As you can see in the screenshots my success rate is more than 60% and From January to Mai i've made 6.321 USD risking 150 USD per trade but in the last two months i've doubled the risk.

January's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmgjq

February's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmhnu

March's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmhtd

April's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmi4q

Mai's Screenshot : http://prntscr.com/jxmics

Anaway the issue is that i've been struggling to get the capital to open a real account

So i thought i'll look for one person no more who's interested in learning to trade and i'll teach him FOR FREE one on one live through SKYPE.

In exchange you will share with me 35% from the Profit at the end of each month for the next 3 months in a row and then everybody goes his way.

But there are rules to be qualified

1- You need to have a background about trading stocks at least the basics 
2- You need to be fast at executing trades and familiar with hot keys

So if you're qualified send me a message at : damon.ffx@gmail.com",2018-06-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ss3cb/have_you_been_trading_for_a_long_time_but_you/

11,Does $HMNY have a future?,8sthap,Petroselinum_,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8sthap/does_hmny_have_a_future/,7,24,"Or is this thing headed to 0?

$AMC has launched a competing subscription product, and so have several other movie theater companies. Some say MovePass' competitors' subscription services are inferior, but that's debatable. After all, AMC's subscription service, for example, offers 3 movies per week, unlimited viewings of the same film, discounted food/drink + free upgrades, and all that for just $19.95. A lot more flexibility and added perks for a few more bucks a month. Plus, one movie a day vs. 3 movies a week isn't a huge difference. Unless consumers are intentionally trying to milk the life out of MoviePass, nobody is realistically going  to see seven films a week, let alone even 3.

The point is, $HMNY looks like it's in really bad shape. The stock has been crazily volatile for the pass few days, their cash burn rate has nearly doubled, they might need $1.2b more in capital, stock dilution is occurring at a crazy rate, and they're floating a reverse stock split in June (which will almost definitely lead to further downside).

So on to the question - does $HMNY even have a future? Is the $12-$15 target price by analysts on TipRanks even legit? Or is this the end of MoviePass as we know? 

TL;DR $HMNY doesn't look too hot right now, and MoviePass is getting pummeled. Reverse split in the mix. What to do?
