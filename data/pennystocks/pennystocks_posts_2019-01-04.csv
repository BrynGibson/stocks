It appears they specialize in branding, and are going the smart way about it. 

I've invested a lot of money into them, that means I'm going to lobby my local politicians to use them as their retail outlets in Ontario. 

The way they are approaching their business model is the way every political party in Canada likes to see it done.

With the Ontario government controlling who gets licenses, this is a win for them. A billion dollar industry that they could potentially have a monopoly over.
