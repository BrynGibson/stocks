0,Question about hidden bids,alvoy9,vortex30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/alvoy9/question_about_hidden_bids/,1,8,"Today I was trading a stock, not really a penny stock (XAU - GoldMoney). It's about $1.60 right now per share, but its very low volume, thinly traded, so I *thought* with my $30,000 trading account I may actually have the ""power"" to move the needle on it, like the big boys do, you know, push it over resistance and start a bull run, that was my naive hope.

So we're at $1.65 resistance, and I see on the Level 2 that there's 2500 shares at $1.65 resistance, and then only ~2000 more shares between $1.66 and $1.73. So I put in a market buy for 5000 shares. And they ALL filled at $1.65. WTF... Level 2 didn't even change. So I put in another buy for 5000 shares. Level 2 doesn't change. Another buy and it doesn't move! So now I'm like, OK, this didn't work... And have reduced my position a bit for holding overnight. Still think this stock has hope to move, daily MACD looking for a cross, just broke out of a long down trend on the daily chart, little follow through thus far, but looking for a higher low and back tested successfully, gold in general is looking good and crypto... well.. at least its not going down for now.. etc.

The really messed up thing is my trades don't even show up in the volume indicator on trading view... It doesn't even show a single 5k volume 5 minute bar at any point almost all day, and I did 15k within 10 minutes...

I understand that hidden bids can exist, and the market makers can ""make a market"" by selling you shares in between the spread when it is convenient, profitable, whatever for them... But c'mon.. 15,000 shares bought at $1.65 when it looked like 4,500 would get this stock to $1.70s... Just seems excessive to me. Is it manipulation, or what? I'm *not* the kind to complain about manipulation, fuck, they've got all the money, they want to take massive risks by manipulating penny stocks that could explode suddenly on news that's their prerogative I guess.

Just wondering what other crazy stories of hidden bids people have, or thoughts on this experience, call me a noob, I definitely am to trading thinly traded stocks. I'm used to SPY and QQQ options and large cap weedstocks shares, so I've never felt I was in the position to maybe move a stock.. Was kind of disappointing to see it not work out lol..",2019-01-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/alvoy9/question_about_hidden_bids/

I like buying stocks for long term plays so u can reap the full benefits of getting in early. Remember Netflix at $30. Right.

I know most of otc is garbage but there has to be one or two worthwhile companies that maybe a diamond in the rough. Personally $INND sticks out to me as that diamond. A real company, will a real disruptive product and in cahoots with Walmart and co. I think this will be big if the company stays on track. They keep opening hearing aid centers. Any other ones you guys like or think will be good long term.  I also think $VRUS formerly $RBIZ will be big!

Colorado Springs, CO, Jan. 31, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Bayport International Holdings, Inc. (OTC Pink: BAYP) (“the Company” or “Bayport”) operates as a diversified holding company with subsidiaries active across cannabis technology, and environmentally-friendly car wash services.

The Company announced the initial signing of the [Letter of Intent](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pXUZ_H4KXn0MGWs-_COEj_gJq3v641u0Yo8xCz_J8ELMbvNZl6VSpYLkWtgLDOgA66snFeyYrFi_bHFRRA8Y-y7MDbFWO0oS6iE07x3L1K-X4SyPv0OtNSvAbUAP2woElj8Mpb2JNV19pgooXgvH2fFsaAkUJBvSCZcdkLZxA7oAQLFQUA-Oj2d_EGoAbeUrhArJlrRD_Y1Nf_CPX11OfW3150cLW25h90AytaZ1i2hGyX2CwXEmPq-l6qRLZr_W_9JZOgxYeHecmhbA8K7VDw==) to acquire the eco carwash operation back on January 10, 2019, which was followed by an announcement of a [binding term sheet](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2BpldOgGL3lX6mlJ7XG17pm6mXqSgom8LjLQO6Vm0Ebg1QDYkISVq4hVG-B6LkZSf_E9PJeRK_fbPkb6oMN-YrPhUXLjyMNnpUE1-EulVsF-JzpF3RCizCJmxlAS8YLYQJOVDDK_thAlLO7RUCM1c3x3Qgdk5hB5FoqiFTDMyr-4I4FjKr4xPKSD8gGc1Bsw_RL18njbGKWuN2kbS8TYIrkcGfg2nZ_3BUOYc7W09UDQc3MnuAzJEE7ciWRj1JoWex0X0ZMFVd7Jx3loaSVS5N_4hAqFTXjSFqQOClcs0Fs=) on January 15, 2019.

With the completion of the 360 Eco Wash acquisition, the Company now officially adds another division alongside Cannabis Technology, within its new holding company business model. In addition, this means Bayport International Holdings is officially generating regular revenues.

Bayport is in the process of building its new corporate website at www.baypcanna.com and we expect it to be up and running by the end of next week.

Bayport CEO Clay Franks: “The completion of the 360 Eco Wash acquisition is a major step for Bayport and diversifying the company through a holding company business model. I am looking forward to the exciting year ahead.”
