Imo they can def keep this price war going for several months.

The value of your total stocks will stay the same, but the stock price will decrease as a result of the split. Lets say the current price of the stock is $40.00 and there will be a 1-40 split. So if it happened your 1 $40.00 stock would become 40 $1.00 stocks.

A reverse split is the opposite. GUSH will be getting a 1-40 reverse split. So for every 40 stocks you have you will now only have one. The current price of the stock is $1.00 so if it happened your 40 $1.00 stocks would become 1 $40.00 stock.",2020-03-10

This is relevant because, on 2/10/20 they filed an 8K, private placement, valued  at $10.2M  for 3.3M shares at $3.08 each. On 2/27/2020, they filed another 8K for $4.2M which equates to 470K shares at $9.00 per share. The issuance of new stock dilutes the current shares outstanding while decreasing the EPS. This also creates negative sentiment and the stock begins to sell-off a bit. In addition, on both 8K‚Äôs they state:
‚ÄúThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for acquisition of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) equipment and raw materials to be used in connection with sale of tests used to diagnose infectious disease, including strains and mutations of coronavirus, as well as research and development costs associated with test development for additional pathogens and test menu expansion, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.‚Äù
 Moreover, you find $41K in Revenue for the Q and $147K for the full year. I believe a large portion of the newly raises capital will go towards working capital, primarily inventory. Replenishing inventory levels is key because you can‚Äôt generate revenue if have no inventory to sell. Below is an article on 3/5/2020 from Business Wire: 
Co-Diagnostics CEO Dwight Egan commented, ""We are already manufacturing and shipping coronavirus products to countries on 4 continents along with additional demand we are experiencing pursuant to the policy change. Recent customer purchases have also included diagnostic equipment to facilitate the availability of molecular diagnostics world-wide, specifically in connection to this global health crisis.‚Äù

This validated the statement on both 8K‚Äôs. While I do think CODX has room to run, I don‚Äôt think it touches its previous high of $21. The stock is not a long term play.

I really think yall are missing out on AYTU. I know, its had its up n downs... but if yall have done any DD, you will see this company has serious potential. They just voted no on a reverse split today, showing they are confident in their company. Also, as of right now they have partnered with Healight and Cedar Sinais hospital (the 8th best hospital in america) to produce UVA ultra light to help cure corona. Today Trump specifically talked about this potential cure. 

AYTU also has lots of other news going for them. Threy just partnered with a Singapore based company, Biolidics Unlimited, to get shipped even more rapid antibody tests.
