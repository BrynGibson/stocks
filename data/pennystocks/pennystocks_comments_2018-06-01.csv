Here is the link. In the pr, it states that they will be buying back share at both market value and negotiated prices. So it could be even be more shares than that. It also says this will take place over time, so I imagine they'll either retire all the shares at the end of the buyback or at multiple times throughout the process. I think of a buyback in terms of a math equation .. PPS x OS = Market cap. Now thats basic but for this it will apply. So if the pps goes up the market cap increases. If the OS goes up and the market cap stays the same ( aka dillution ) the pps goes down. But if the OS goes down and the market cap stays the same, the pps proportionally will shift the keep the equation even. Did that make sense? Its like a sliding bar with the OS and PPS. Idk it helped me maybe itll help you. Glty",2018-06-01

Electric vehicles are actually very sought-after in this field at the moment but from somebody who routinely is looking for different options for a vehicle Fleet I can tell you that this model looks very bulky. I understand it's a prototype. This company would benefit greatly from having a four-wheeled vehicle instead of 3 that Ops out for an open cage instead of a cab. Mobile security like this is all about just that, Mobility. When you're working Outdoors or in a wide open space having doors on your vehicle can actually impede your work progress, on top of that I have security staff that use a lot of equipment such as radars and have utility belts on that make it cumbersome to get in and out of vehicles with tight spaces. Hands down that's why we always turn to things like off-road vehicles and golf carts they are Speedy reliable and offer comfort and ease of use for many of our officers in the field were vehicle such as a patrol car would be too cumbersome.
