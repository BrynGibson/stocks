23,CO2 GRO Inc - Notes from my calls with Same Kanes &amp; John Archibald,9oz672,I_Zeig_I,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9oz672/co2_gro_inc_notes_from_my_calls_with_same_kanes/,1,1,"If you’ve already heard of [CO2 GRO Inc. (TSX-GROW.V, OTC-BLONF)](http://www.co2gro.ca/pages/home) and understand their product please skip to my call below, if not then let’s start here. CO2 GRO Inc (from here out also referred to as the “company”) specializes in accelerated plant growth through the use of foliar spray. Foliar sprays are simply a mist/spray of any liquid compounds onto plants. Similar to the misters in the veggie section at a grocery store, but while the plants are still growing. Foliar sprays can be anything from pure water to a mix of fertilizer and pesticides. The foliar spray provided by the company contains 1800 PPM of CO2 gas dissolved into pure water. The quick science behind this product being the porous leaves absorb the benign foliar spray’s CO2 and thus have extra carbon to use for growth and photosynthesis. The natural method of CO2 uptake is via CO2 in the air contacting plant’s stomata (little holes) at the atmospheric concentration of 410PPM. The company is targeting the marijuana industry &amp; agriculture as a whole.



**Current Data** - All information in this section can be found on CO2 GRO’s website and corporate presentations. I’m only presenting a portion of relevant information.


* Cannabis value increase of ~75% (including THC &amp; growth speed increase)
* Product/process is legal for food use in the US, Canada &amp; Europe.
* Application of product provides Greenhouse cannabis crops accelerated growth to the extent that an extra crop can be grown each year.
* Cannabis trials have shown an extra potential profit of $100M/yr per 1M sqr-ft of green house space. 
* [Cannabis bud weight increase of 25%](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/10/01/1587764/0/en/CO2-GRO-Announces-74-Increased-Commercial-Cannabis-Bud-Value.html)
* Dissolved aqueous CO2 shown to be 1000% more effective than CO2 gas for plant Carbon uptake.
* Test have shown no indication of powdery residue or mildew
* CO2 GRO Foliar spray has shown tests application to other leafy crops such as Lettuce &amp; Flowers
* Tobacco is also a promising industry for application. 
* More efficient/cost/safe than traditional Greenhouse CO2 gassing. 
* Only CO2 solution to outdoor crops.
* NOTE: According to Health Canada’s Cannabis rules, Foliar spray is illegal to use on any commercial Marijuana crops. The company is in the process of getting approval.
* Health Canada (Hereby also called HC) has confirmed the company’s Foliar spray is not a pesticide, supplement or additive. This is approval to proceed trying to legalize the product in the Cannabis industry.



**Information from my call with CO2 GRO Inc’s Sam Kanes VP of Buisness Development/Director  &amp; John Archibald CEO/Director.**  - This will be a mix of notes I took during the calls &amp; comments from the discussion. Notes are in no particular order.


* Management has agreed not to take a salary until positive EBITDA
* Pending as of summer 2018 and add dissolve CO2 to enhance plant growth by any application method
* The Company has decided in partner with a major California nursery to trial application. Also, have numerous trials lined up for next year in hemp, cannabis, lettuce, microgreens and flowers to start across Canada and California, Colorado, Michigan and Florida
* Ground up install annual CO2 GRO revenue may go anywhere from $25K/yr to $5M/yr depending on size of facility and value of plant. That is ALL plants, not just cannabis
* The device used to dissolve the CO2 into the water vary by size from a small tube to a pool filter, would be plugged in-line to existing over-head watering systems and uses the hydraulic force of in line water from a cistern to allow osmotic forces to take over. (Basically requires very little power)
* The CO2 devices would not be for sale, but rather would be leased to customers with maintenance included.
* Largest CO2 Unit can process 3,000 gal/min
* CO2 application requires approx. 0.5 tons/acre of crop. Using both local and non-local sourcing the company can obtain reliable organically sourced CO2 for approx. $50/ton.
* Potential to experiment with other benign nutrients
* Patent includes hand held foliar spray systems (inefficient due to man power needs compared to overhead irrigation racks, but covers their bases)
* When asked about competitors creating a similar product or a cannabis LP manufacturing their own CO2 dissolved in water for accelerated plant growth the response was that it could violate their patent and they would sue for Trebel Damages. 
* When asked when the Company will expect to hear back from HC, I was informed that with HC’s initial confirmation that the product is not a pesticide they now need convince the very busy Cannabis division of HC. Through the latest round of warrants the company has raised the funds necessary for Dr. Lucas Shane to work on this. 
* The company is trying not to over-expand and will be staying in North America for now.
*  When asked about a buyout the response was that anything will be entertained, but only in the best interest of the company/share holders. There is always the possibility of an exclusivity agreement for any particular industry. Ultimately anything is possible, but management alone holds just over 25% of the shares.
* the CO2 devices are in ready supply &amp; the company has the right to make more of them.
* Installation into customer’s systems would be handled by irrigation/building corporate partners. I was given the impression installation is pretty simple if the irrigation system is already in place.
* The company plans to get the attention/business of big agriculture corporations through connections with major investors (in the works), Agg business industrial shows, press releases and marketing groups.
* Sam mentioned they have taken quite a few visits to Leamington. Take that as you will.
* The company is in talks with several Florida MJ LPs. 
* When pressed on who in the cannabis industry they have lined up for tests and who they have talked to I was understandably told that he couldn’t disclose that, but the industry is well aware of their technology and is waiting in for the HC approval before starting trials. He said there is a lot of interest and even though he couldn’t say any names, as alluded to in past its “**the who’s who**”. 

**Conclusion - Moving Forward** - This is 100% data I’ve read and my opinions, please do your own DD before investing.

I’m hard pressed to think of any company that wouldn’t take a minimum 25% increase to their production/profits. CO2 GRO cornered an enormous market with a relatively simple concept. Not only can they improve the cannabis market, this technology has the potential to revolutionize large areas of agriculture. As of 10/17/18 the SP stands at 0.15 USD. Small companies go under every day, but CO2 grow is gaining traction with consistent positive results and legal application in the food market, not to mention a strong and experienced management. With foreseeably  low overhead and ease of application into existing irrigation systems I’m excited to see where this company goes. 

In my opinion the biggest risk at the moment isn’t being bought out but rather losing momentum if the office of HC-Cannabis does not approve or drags their feet. Even without marijuana the company is still applicable and proven in agriculture.

27,NASA Places Initial Order for KULR's Battery Testing Devices,9otqx8,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9otqx8/nasa_places_initial_order_for_kulrs_battery/,1,0,"CAMPBELL, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct 16, 2018--KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KUTG), (the “Company” or “KULR”), today announced that NASA has placed an initial order for the Internal Short Circuit (ISC) trigger battery cells, which can replicate lithium-ion battery cell failures in battery pack designs. The ISC is licensed, manufactured and distributed by KULR under an exclusive agreement with the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

“We are pleased to continue our long and productive relationship with NASA and help them continue their pioneering work on battery safety,” said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR Technology Group. “As the exclusive commercialization partner for this ground-breaking technology, we will be providing NASA with initial test cells this quarter and ramp up commercial production in the first quarter of 2019,” Mo said.

“We have seen growing interest in ISC trigger cells from different industries and geographic regions. We have been working with tier-one battery cell manufacturers to make the trigger cells in both 18650 and 21700 form factors. We expect 2019 to be a breakout year for this ISC technology and establish it as the go-to standard for battery design safety testing for various industries and applications. Our ISC testing technology makes batteries safer and global battery manufacturers are realizing it,” Mo said.

Lithium-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power; billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. But lithium-ion batteries fail, sometimes with catastrophic results. Due to the relative rarity of cell failures, scientists and researchers struggle to reliably or accurately replicate latent defect cell failures in lab settings, impeding research into safer battery technology.

The cornerstone of the E-mobility ecosystem is battery safety. Whether you’re addressing electric vehicles, charging stations, power generation, power distribution and storage, or aerospace and defense, advancing battery safety is essential for wider market adoption. The ISC technology received the prestigious R&amp;D100 Award in 2016, was runner-up NASA invention of the year in 2017 and is now part of NASA’s “Crewed Space Vehicle Battery Safety Requirements.”

KULR’s core technology is a NASA-developed, space-used, vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible, and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. As pure carbon, KULR fiber is perfectly heat efficient. And because it behaves like a flexible fabric it can fit with just about any power or electronic configuration in extremely demanding spaces with minimal contact pressure, increasing efficiency and safety for a variety of thermal management and energy storage uses across a range of markets.

About KULR Technology Group, Inc.

Founded by some of the foremost experts in aerospace thermal management, KULR’s mission is to utilize space technologies to make e-mobility cooler and safer. KULR is joined by industry veterans in semiconductor and industrial manufacturing.

TULSA, OK, Oct. 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- AppSwarm, Inc. (OTC: SWRM) and KYN Capital Group Inc. (OTC: KYNC) announced that they signed a co-marketing agreement to market each other’s products. Algae World Inc., a Los Angeles headquartered algae production company, which owns several subsidiaries now projects that its revenues will surpass five million dollars through the first half of 2019 ([http://www.algaeworld.info](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4eHbde-zU2nZzcX-KbVNiiAJZcSrpU1MIbyykRI-OvaPIFQKMR7fQmvBdCBbhBo7Bq8LSwvJPe3KxTeU30OeUPZH-B3LaCl0Nal8_aM6RQ8=)). Further, they anticipate their Co-Marketing Agreement with AppSwarm Inc., will help add to the Bottom Line.  


Mr. Wyatt Murphy, Chief Technology Officer of Algae World, Inc., said that they are in the process of infusing algae to its various organic foods to the market and are also involved with several CBD infused products including CBD water and Soda, which will be rolled out over the next several months. “We are in the process of establishing one of the largest indoor Blue Green Algae (Spirulina) commercial production facilities in Los Angeles,” said Mr. Adil Malik, CEO of Algae World, Inc.

Blue-green algae is sort of a general term for the group of organisms that includes several varieties including Spirulina. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, blue-green algae is a superfood and has been used as a food or medicine for centuries, with Spirulina dating back to the 14th century in Aztec diets.

The Benefits of Spirulina may include the following:

**It’s Full of Protein**

According to health.com, Spirulina clocks in at an impressive 70% protein by weight, making it a stellar source of plant-based protein, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Just one tablespoon of spirulina powder can provide six grams of protein, the same amount as an egg.

**It’s Full of Vitamins**

FitDay reports that blue-green algae has more than 64 vitamins and minerals. A few include vitamins A, C, E, B12, and B6 as well as calcium and magnesium. The organism is also rich in antioxidants, which are vital in preventing cell damage.

**It Might Ward off Infections**

This has not been proven to work on people, but test tube studies indicate that spirulina can fight against herpes, the flu, and HIV. Of course, this is not an actual course of treatment with scientific backing, but blue-green algae could play a role in developing new medications.

**It Might Help with Liver Damage**

The University of Maryland writes that there is some evidence that spirulina could help fight liver damage for those with hepatitis, but further research is needed.

**It Might Lower Inflammation** 

A report in the Journal of Medicinal Food suggests that blue-green algae can prevent inflammation and oxidative stress, which are tied to age-related diseases and cancer.
