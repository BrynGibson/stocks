2,TheBushmonger,edwqvnt,/r/pennystocks/comments/af9q1m/what_type_account_to_open/edwqvnt/,1,Robinhood usually doesn't have all penny stocks listed as many are OTC so a broker like TD or fidelity is preferable.,2019-01-12
3,IknitSteel,edwrue7,/r/pennystocks/comments/af9q1m/what_type_account_to_open/edwrue7/,1,"I am in a pretty similar situation, and honestly I think TD Ameritrade has the best available platform. You can open an account with $50, and have access to their ThinkOrSwim platform. I spent hours watching YouTube videos and learning how to use the platform and all the things it's capable of. One of the draw backs is the trading fees, it costs money everytime you want to buy or sell a stock (6.95). But in my opinion it is well worth it. One of the cool things about thinkorswim is you get a paper trading account for free, and you can use it to practice with the platform and really get a good feel for trading. I only have about $1000 saved up in my account so far, but the experience and understanding I have gained using the platform, I feel make it worth the extra costs. Good luck on your journey!",2019-01-12

5,scottwagoner,edwvotf,/r/pennystocks/comments/af9q1m/what_type_account_to_open/edwvotf/,1,"I opened an IB account with only $500. I use TOS platform for charting. 
IB has a minimum charge for buying and selling of only $1 in and $1 out. 
I’ve heard of people being able to contact TD Ameritrade and asking for lower fees. The I’ve heard was $3.95 per transaction.  It I think that guy traded a lot. And had a pretty decent sized account. 
Personally I think IB’s customer service sucks. But you get what you pay for I guess. ",2019-01-12

I have traded sub penny stocks on there (although I would not recommend it)",2019-01-12
