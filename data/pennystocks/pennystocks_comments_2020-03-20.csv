But assisting with the dead helps the living. Plus, they're not doing the killing. Funeral homes don't cause damage, they just deal with the aftermath and I'm ok with that. Proper disposal of the dead is essential. It's an extremely important - crucial, even - service.

Plenty of people invest in companies that do destroy and/or kill - some that even do it on purpose, whether it's the environment or humanity.

Exxon, Dupont, Monsanto, Nestle, for example. Even our pharmaceutical companies can become the harbingers of death and societal destruction - the opioid crisis, for example (I'm looking at you Sackler family). Look at the dismal response to our current state of affairs by the billionaires we continue to support - Bezos, Musk, Bloomberg, Gates, etc. I'm not impressed.

Any money I make won't be at the expense of the living and the dead don't care. I'm fine with that.

Word of warning: be careful. JNUG is leveraged, and as such doesn't (necessarily) recover in the same way a normal stock or unleveraged ETF would.

The historical stock price of a leveraged ETF like JNUG isn't a good indicator for future price targets, due to daily rebalancing and compounded losses. Basically, the underlying index could make a full recovery, but leave JNUG at a small fraction of what it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

In general, leveraged ETFs like JNUG are designed for short-term (typically intra-day) use, and aren't recommended for long-term holds. By all means, buy JNUG if you think there's going to be a near-term spike in gold-mining stocks, but don't buy on the expectation that when mining recovers, JNUG will return to its former stock price - leveraged ETFs don't (usually) work like that.",2020-03-20

500,chthonian_chaffinch,fl30dy3,/r/pennystocks/comments/fm29w5/jnug_after_corona/fl30dy3/,1,"The 300% leverage means that if the underlying index goes down by 5%, the ETF should go down by 15%. If the index goes up by 10%, the ETF goes up by 30%. The baseline value ""resets"" each day (""rebalancing"").

Because of that daily rebalancing, losses are compounded, and gains that happen after losses are impacting a much smaller value.

For instance, say our index value is $1000 and our 3X ETF value is $1000.

* We trend downwards at a rate of 5% per day, until the index loses about half its value
* After trending down for 15 days, the index is at $513, and the ETF is down to $120
* Now, we have a sharp rebound where the index regains all of that value in two days: +50% and +30%
* The index is now at $1001, but our ETF is only worth $574

If we instead trended up at 5% per day, our ETF would be worth $876 - better, but we're still at a loss.

We also see losses when the market moves horizontally - especially when the market is choppy - or when the market chops with an upward trend.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that, leveraged ETFs use derivatives to provide that 300% leverage, and are more exposed to changes in market volatility.",2020-03-20

&gt;if the stock isn't directly linked to the actually thing it's invested in? 

It *is* linked to the thing it's invested in (junior gold miner stocks - specifically, JNUG attempts to track The MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index). But the 300% levered tracking is only accurate to a single day - beyond that the relation between JNUG's price and the underlying index becomes an increasingly complex math problem that depends on variables not worth trying to predict.

The idea behind price movements within a day, though, is pretty straightforward: if gold-mining goes up, JNUG goes up 3X as much (roughly), and vice versa.

For an unlevered alternative (for longer-term holds), see GDXJ. You'll find a similarly shaped chart, with less-impressive (but more attainable) peaks and valleys.",2020-03-20

551,WellerSpecialReserve,fl93whl,/r/pennystocks/comments/flpz38/simple_questions_march_20_2020/fl93whl/,1,From what I‚Äôve been reading in more advanced/experienced posts rarely are purchased options exercised even when in the money.  Why is that?  From my elementary level of understanding I thought that exercising the option and the delta between strike and current price is the profit.   If you have a month long put and notice the stock is tanking hard by week two why not exercise and take the payout?,2020-03-20

Anyway, I don't, and currently can't, meet the $25,000 account minimum requirement that that apparently necessitates right now. I see something saying my account will be frozen for 90 days, which is annoying, but I can deal with it. That said, will everything about my account just go back to normal after 90 days?

So if the stock is currently 1000$ but you think it will go up to 1200$. You could either buy 1 share if you only have 1000$ or you could buy 10 contracts for 100$ premiums each, which is effectively like owning 10k worth of that stock.

The risk is if it drops in price to say 800$. If you bought the share, you lost 200$ but if you bought contracts, they are worthless. So you would lose all of your initial investment.",2020-03-20

Get some to begin with so you have shares Incase there is a settlement then your covered with shares.  But then you can put in separate GTC buy orders in at lower prices to try and get some shares when the price manipulation happens maybe you will get lucky and catch some cheap shares.  That would really be good.  It happens sometimes.  But not very often.  Very little people selling shares these days.  There mostly all holding out for the trial decision snd expectations of a big price jump.  I think it will be in stages if they win.  First big jump from the wining the first Utah Trial.  Then the massive parabolic jump from winning the future Federal RICO lawsuit.  That‚Äôs where the Resl big money will come from.  But who knows.  Maybe the Defendants will settle to try to avoid the big money damages.  God only knows bro.,2020-03-20
