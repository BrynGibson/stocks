HMNY (the company that owns MoviePass) is trading at a .18. I bought in expecting MoviePass to try to save their shit in a Hail Mary attempt, and I am a little bit of a gambler. The 52 week high from HMNY was 9k when I bought a few weeks ago (52 weeks prior, now the 52 week high is $3917), incidentally two months before they bought MoviePass in December 2017.

HMNY just made an announcement about 23 hours ago, saying they are spinning MoviePass off into into own corporation to separate themselves from it, so would now be a good time to dump some into HMNY, since they are dumping what could have killed their business?

Although I do have to say, the news was released yesterday, and there was no spike yesterday afternoon or this morning.

Due to the slow development in the cannabis industry and prolong weakness of the crypto sector, the Company had made a few adjustments to its business plan.  The development efforts on several previously announced applications and crypto ecosystem had been put on hold temporarily.  For the near future, the Company plans to focus on three main applications, advertising portal, dating and online store.

Due to limited traction, the Cannaxa.com site has been taken down and some of its features are being integrated into MJCircle.com.  In addition to being an advertising portal, MJCircle will allow users to post their profiles and interact with other service providers or customers.

The Company recognizes that there is a large population of like minded individuals in the cannabis sector and as such it has initiated development effort on a dating application that will allow these individuals to socialize and connect.  The application will be available on the desktop as well as mobile devices.  Soft launch of the platform is tentatively scheduled before year end.

Development effort for the online store, CannaMedi.com, has been initiated and the site is expected to go live before the end of the quarter.  CannaMedi will offer for sale various pain relief and wellness related products that are CBD based.

“The development of the cannabis industry and adaptation of the crypto technology have not materialized as we anticipated so it was necessary for us to reorganize and refocus our efforts for the near term.  Once launched, we expect the three applications to attract a large number of users resulting in strong revenue streams for UA Multimedia,” commented Michael Lajtay, President and interim CEO.",2018-10-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9rcjxs/uamm_ua_multimedia_announces_reorganization_and/
