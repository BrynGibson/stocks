""    As a result, a portion of the distribution will be treated as a partial  liquidation for federal income tax purposes with the remaining portion treated as a non-dividend distribution for US tax purposes. ""

It appears the whole distribution will be basically a return of capital. This is not taxed but lowers your cost basis  on the stock.

So buy the stock at 2.32 - 1.77 (Distribution = Return of capital)  your adjusted cost basis is now .56 .  If sold the stock at 2.00 now you have a capital gain of 1.44 .

"" The return of capital portion of a distribution is not considered  taxable income for the current tax year.  However, the adjusted cost  base of the security must be reduced by the amount of the return of  capital.  As a result, the capital gain is greater when the investment  is eventually sold.

Given the time of the trade(s), it would lead me to suspect it was a darkpool trade. In case you are unfamiliar, see this link [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp) 

Given the ""short and distort"" campaign which was occurring in the months leading up to this trade, my theory would be that it was a fund with a massive short position covering their position.

I cannot find any proof of this, or who it was, but that would be exactly why they did it in the darkpool.

Here is the news link from YRIV regarding litigation against Hindenburg Research, Natahn Anderson, ClaritySpring Securities LLC, and ClaritySpring Inc  [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/yangtze-river-port-and-logistics-limited-files-lawsuit-20190125-00315](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/yangtze-river-port-and-logistics-limited-files-lawsuit-20190125-00315)
