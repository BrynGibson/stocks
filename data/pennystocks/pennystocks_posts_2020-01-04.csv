5,Why did oil penny stocks surge during premarket/AH but then level out or drop after opening today?,eju1rt,SentientReptile,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eju1rt/why_did_oil_penny_stocks_surge_during_premarketah/,2,11,"TL;DR: This morning I was looking at ZN, HUSA, CEI, LLEX, and MCEP and saw that they were all moving up during AH and Premkt. Looked to me like these stocks were set to burst out the gate when the market opened. They didn't. What happened, and why do they all follow the same pattern? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a beginner, so go easy on me. My portfolio is down a couple hundred bucks today after misreading(?) what I thought were promising signs for upward price movement. 

I bought shares of ZN, HUSA, CEI, LLEX, and MCEP today during premarket after seeing 30%+ movement on nearly all of these stocks. My previous experience and observation told me that this meant that when the market opened at 0930, these stocks would be sprinting out the gate. I swear I had a little chub going as I thought about the riches that lay before me. 

I was so hyped that I even bought a couple of calls for $ERX, and $XOP because those were showing good signs (or so I thought) during premarket too. Ugh. Down like $90 on the options alone. 

Because of the movement before the market opened, I thought that meant that these stocks were set to explode. But they all kinda fizzled out or just didnt move once the market opened. Every single one of them follows the same pattern of spiking up 15-30% or so right before the market opened, and then leveling out or declining. 

Can someone explain to me what happened here, and why all of these separate stocks behaved almost identically?",2020-01-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eju1rt/why_did_oil_penny_stocks_surge_during_premarketah/
