13,GMBL - Esports Entertainment Group,8l2hc6,TheHammerIsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8l2hc6/gmbl_esports_entertainment_group/,22,8,"Took a look at GMBL last friday and noticed every April-October there is a price increase then gradual decrease. This makes sense because the major Esports events are March-November. 

Sadly I didn't get in on friday because sure enough the price skyrocketed from $0.60 to $1.40 in a matter of hours. 

Looking at their news releases, it appears good news is being released almost daily now. And as of 30 minutes ago, Epic Games (The Creator of Fortnite) just released news that they will be supplying an unheard of amount of $100,000,000 to the esports prize pool this year. While that money is going to esports in general and not this specific company, this is huge for the esports community and GMBL is one of the leading stocks in esports

The company looks like a clear pump and dump but I saw it posted here a month or two ago and have paid close attention to it since. Now is a great time to get in before it explodes like it does every year.

Thanks for reading! Best of luck",2018-05-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8l2hc6/gmbl_esports_entertainment_group/

Hoping for some news on wells or things like that, but don't seem to see much too recently outside of Q1 production which seemed to me about what was expected for the company.",2018-05-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8l3pfp/any_news_about_husa/
