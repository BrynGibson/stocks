In a case where it worked -- it was with AMMA, the RS made me a bunch of money.

Depends on the situation.  With AMMA (now word) a profitable company bought the shell company and the stock shot up to $10 on opening after the RS.   I'm risk adverse and any time a shitty shell co pops like this I'm out --so I sold it that second it bumped.

&gt; 

Pretty much what I said in another comment yesterday.  I get some great leads from this sub....but the majority of users here are not great investors.  The reason most people on this sub say there's no money to be made in penny stocks is because they are blinded to actual potential in these companies.  *Everything* is a pump and dump to them.  I flip a lot pump and dump stocks every week to make a few hundred dollars, and that money goes into a handful of big potentials every year.  Most of them end up not going anywhere, but the ones that do more than make up for it.  I got a downpayment for my current house with that strategy.  Wouldn't surprise me  if SHMP pays off the rest of my mortgage in the next five years time.",2019-02-07
