On July¬†16, 2019, Sierra Oncology, Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until January¬†13, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company‚Äôs common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this 180-day period, unless Nasdaq exercises its discretion to extend this 10-day period as discussed in Rule 5810(c)(3)(G).

If the Company is not in compliance by January¬†13, 2020, the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would need to transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market, provided that it meets the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, the Company will be required to pay an application fee to Nasdaq and will need to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency, which may include, if necessary, implementing a reverse stock split, during the additional compliance period.

If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance periods, including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company‚Äôs common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing.

The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and consider options to resolve the noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.",2020-01-09

Also since you are in the UK the time the market opens would be 1430 your time and ends at 2100. I think.  


1. Its best to read books I recommend How to do Penny Stocks for dummies. They pretty much tell you some of the dos and don'ts. When I first started I made some mistakes the book mentioned, and I corrected them such as buying stock when the percentage is going up never do it.   

2. Do a lot of research on the company before investing. Be skeptical of reports that basically hype up the company, because then after they get paid the stocks tend to tank down. Plus, asking people questions helps out a lot to give you a better idea what you want to do. Also, never go Yolo into a stock. If you got 1000$ I would distribute it between multiple stocks, so it isn't a big lose that one company you invested that 1000$ tanks. Also don't get into cryptocurrency. Its way too risky and volatile. I saw bitcoin drop from 6300 or 6400$ and go back up to 7100$ in one day.    

3. Regarding apps and sites to use, Robinhood has a 0% commission fee and I believe TD Ameritrade has a 0% commission fee while sites like Etrade has a 6.95$ fee for every trade whether its buy or sell. I started with Robinhood and its a excellent beginner stock trader app and site. However, they do not have all the stocks that this subreddit has such as DMAN, CBDD, and so on. If you see some company that is mentioned search it on Robinhood and if it isn't there go on Etrade. I moved on from Robinhood and mainly use it for dividends. Etrade is great for penny stocks in my own opinion. TD Ameritrade I use the app, called thinkorswim, just to look at charts since you can customize how many charts of different companies you can put on it.  

4. I'll be honest it is like gambling, but if you do your research and trust your gut feeling you'll have a better chance at seeing a profit gain and knowing when to take your profits and run. Plus you can set it up to where if it goes below a certain percentage you can just sell it all off. It really sucks taking a lost, but it could go down even further. You don't want to get greedy, because then if it tanks then you'll be kicking yourself down. Some people take 30% and dip out or 80% and dip out.

200,TheRamsinator,fdws2wj,/r/pennystocks/comments/emd3ef/new_blog_top_5_trading_mistakes_new_traders_make/fdws2wj/,1,"My Top 5:

1. BELIEF IN TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (charts) - Technical analysis is not supported by mainstream academic thought, which overwhelmingly believes in efficient markets and random walks, and TA is particularly harmful to new traders who see it as a crystal ball and therefore put too much confidence in it. That over confidence pushes new traders into over-trading and under diversifying. Worse yet, many new traders pay steep fees for ‚Äúeducation materials‚Äù that promote TA, thereby cutting into their starting cash. Unfortunately, since penny stocks have high yields, bouncing from one group to another group randomly should lead to growth over time, so traders often think that they‚Äôre winning, even though they actually paid a lot of money for suboptimal strategies that are costing them a lot in *potential* earnings. 

2. OVER-TRADING - Many new traders see active investment as the only way to generate returns. However, active traders set prices, and passive investors float with prices. Therefore, transaction costs aside, the average passive trader is exactly as successful as the average active trader. The problem with active trading, though, is that it has higher transaction costs. Taxes are usually less favorable, bid-ask spreads can cut into returns, and certain platforms charge commissions, which can also decrease returns.

3. UNDER-DIVERSIFICATION - Many new traders fail to appreciate the benefits of modern portfolio theory, and they go all in on a singular trade. Diverse portfolios tend to be more stable because they reduce the impact of company-specific risk. As such, traders can reach for enhanced gains by investing in riskier companies without feeling the full cost of the risk. 

4. FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ACTUAL RISK TOLERANCE - Many new traders don‚Äôt take the time to understand where they are in life compared to when they‚Äôll need the money. This causes some traders to take very conservative positions, and therefore accept accompanying low returns, despite being decades away from needing the money. Other traders often take extreme risks, despite having very little time to recover any lost cash before it will be needed. 

5. SHORTING - No new traders should ever invest in something with an unlimited downside. Shorts should be kept to very seasoned investors who either understand the trade very well, or at least know how to hedge any loss. Too many novice investors take a position that‚Äôs an unhedged short, and then run to the internet asking what they did once the trade goes sideways, and their account starts showing a lot of red. Unfortunately, that movement can happen very quickly, and the damage can while out a portfolio in one fell swoop.",2020-01-09
201,mtmtrader,fdwugqy,/r/pennystocks/comments/emd3ef/new_blog_top_5_trading_mistakes_new_traders_make/fdwugqy/,1,"Some solid info. Technical analysis works though. Maybe not for everyone but nothing works for everyone and that doesn‚Äôt mean that it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù I can use technicals to predict short term moves with 75%+ accuracy with years of data to support that statement. If technicals didn‚Äôt work I would not be able to have that much of an edge with that much consistency.

Also, shorting has no more risk that any other trade if you‚Äôre handling risk properly and cutting losses. It‚Äôs certainly not for beginners but is a great way to profit in bearish conditions when you know what you‚Äôre doing! *Note: I personally only short intraday (I don‚Äôt hold overnight) to avoid the risk of some kind of overnight news being released and causing a large loss on my short position.  This isn‚Äôt an issue for me as a day trader, but can be for anyone holding short positions for days, weeks, months at a time.

206,TheRamsinator,fefxw5j,/r/pennystocks/comments/emd3ef/new_blog_top_5_trading_mistakes_new_traders_make/fefxw5j/,1,"To be clear, technical analysis doesn‚Äôt work for anyone. It‚Äôs like having a system to win the lotto. A bunch of people do it, and some inevitably win, but they don‚Äôt win because of the system. 

The stock market has a positive expected value. One could expect to see a portfolio grow by picking stocks at random. People who ‚Äúfind success‚Äù using TA tend to be under diversified and have crazy swings (some has to win the lotto), and/or don‚Äôt appropriately benchmark and therefore overstate gains. 

As far as shorting goes, Scholes from the Black-Scholes Options Pricing formula accepted his Nobel Prize while going bankrupt from options trading (LTCM). While I‚Äôll agree that you can hedge bets with shorts, and they are a vital tool to securing favorable risk adjusted gains, the risk for a novice/beginner trader is immense. That risk is especially strong now, given that we are in the longest bull market in American history, and new traders haven‚Äôt seen adverse black swan events. Volatility smiles are a real thing.",2020-01-09
