on line 4 they state Netlist asked 6$ pr lrdimm, and 90cent for RDIMM.. He sais that was their latest offer, then is asked if they have done any calcurations on how much it would be.. and he sais ""i dont know, i have it on paper here, but i am sure we done some calcurations in the past""

he is then asked how much it was on line 13, and says on line 14, he cant recall the number..

on line 15 we are told that hynix expert has calcurated that it would requere a payment around 234m, and netlist is asked if that sounds correct.. 

on the next page line 2, can you give us an approximate estimate of how much money that would be.. and again hong sais he need to know how much they have shipped for that period.

on line 8, netlist is then asked to accept the number 237m, as an example, just for the additional questions.

so again its a number that netlist does not agree to, and it was used in the interview in the court as theoretical number.

So i still see my original statement to be true. Here are some screenshots of the documents, so anyone can read it.

here is a link to the document mentioned.
