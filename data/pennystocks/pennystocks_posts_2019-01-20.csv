2,Weekly penny stocks recap $MBOT $BIOC $LMFA $KOTV,ai136l,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ai136l/weekly_penny_stocks_recap_mbot_bioc_lmfa_kotv/,1,0,"NOTE: those who are not interested in weekly recaps, please, you can skip it and have an option not to read this. Thank you in advance. There will never be a recommendation to buy or sell stock as well. I do consider recommending stocks on forums and social media groups irresponsible action to others and the risks users can encounter by trading other people ideas without fully understanding them are very dangerous. I do believe recaps, a stock analysis, sharing important news about the stock are more useful for the majority of readers.

&amp;#x200B;

Now getting back to the recap.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock market in general show recovery and general stock indices are heading higher. Among micro and nanocaps, we saw many offerings happening these past weeks. Like $MBOT, $BIOC, $KTOV (just this week). As well we saw bigger volume pouring into these stocks making them great day trading opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

You can find a video recap here: [https://youtu.be/4031u89Caqo](https://youtu.be/4031u89Caqo)

&amp;#x200B;

For the readers, let's now look at the stocks in this week's recap

&amp;#x200B;

$MBOT is are classic nanocap stock that traded its float. To be more exact it traded 20x its float during the first rally day )(float is around 1.85 million shares &amp; daily volume during the first big day was 37 million). This type of technical event can signal huge rallies in daily stock price. Combined with good news this stocks launched itself +300%. Next day $MBOT announced direct offering priced at-the-market or ATM. ATM allows companies to sell newly issued stocks straight to the market and use these proceeds for their business. So as usual with these manipulative nano-cap stocks, the first day was the day when the stock was pumped higher with the help of kinda a positive news and huge volume that created this mass hysteria that attracted many participants to trade this stock. Low float stock with such huge demand mostly just rallies up so the next day it was a good time for the company to unload these new shares at really great price creating many bagholders in the process. This is a sad reality what is actually happened with this stock. So when trading nanocaps you should be very strict with the risk management and try to speculate during the intraday price action. Holding these stock overnight can kill your position. As from short seller's perspective, there was no real possibility to actually locate shortable shares so shorting this stock was most likely imposable.

&amp;#x200B;

$BIOC this is the stock which should not be forgotten during this week's trading. $BIOC as well announced offering. In the video, I talked more about dilutive and nondilutive offerings so you could understand the difference while if you are interested in short selling these stocks you should be interested in finding dilutive offerings. But to save your time this offering was dilutive so we know that the total amount of shares increased shrinking current investors ownership in the company. This fundamental attribute actually helps to figure out possible price trend. So why I think $BIOC should not be forgotten because there were around 30-60k shares to short (at IB stockbroker) at the time when the stock was trading near 200ma making it way less crowded and better opportunity to short sell.

&amp;#x200B;

$LMFA this is the stock that many beginners can interpret wrongly because of the news they released. $LMFA announced about the completed acquisition. While this can be positive for the company in the long term remember that company which buys another company has to put money/capital for it so this is actually negative short term while balance sheet is affected because of the purchase. The stock gapped up and was trading higher a bit before losing it and making two consecutive red days afterward.

&amp;#x200B;

$KTOV the last stock in the recap which acted like $MBOT and put nice PR show the first day which helped to pump the stock and then announced dilutive offering the next day. I do believe you already see the pattern among these manipulative stocks. The stock had many shortable shares and was an easy target the next day after a huge first-day rally to short sell. Of course, there was a great opportunity to day trade the first day, but not like $MBOT, $KTOV started next day with the gap down which is more common price action than $MBOT additional next day rally. This is why holding overnight such cray gainers are risky.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you gained knowledge about offerings and how they affect the future price of a stock from this week's recap. See you next week and good luck trading!

Hot stocks of the week I was watching were $MBOT, $KTOV, $BIOC. In this recap I go in depth over my plans and day trading strategies for entering the stock and technical analysis for beginner day traders.Â Also I went over how to figure out the penny stock press release news were fluff as a way to pump the stock price higher for a potential offering later on. Learning this as a beginner could save you a lot of money from stock market manipulation in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

$KTOV $MBOT $BIOC and $LMFA will again be on my watchlist for the coming week for follow throughs. This recap is mostly for myself as a record of what happened this week. I used to write a lot of journals but nowadays I find recording videos way more useful for myself visually. Hopefully this helps someone out there.
