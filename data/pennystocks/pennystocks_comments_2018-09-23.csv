4,JustRedditingAlong,e6hupz5,/r/pennystocks/comments/9i9gcz/what_the_difference_between_limit_order_and_a/e6hupz5/,1,"Example of a Stop-Limit Order

For example, assume that ABC is trading at $40 and an investor wants to buy the stock once it begins to show some serious upward momentum. The investor has put in a stop-limit order to buy with the stop price at $45 and the limit price at $46. If the price of ABC Inc. moves above $45 stop price, the order is activated and turns into a limit order. As long as the order can be filled under $46, which is the limit price, the trade will be filled. If the stock gaps above $46, the order will not be filled.",2018-09-23

Is it the same process? If it is when you see the stop limit order on selling the stock will it show on the market or only when it's in range of the stop and limit price selected?  

Thx, much appreciated mate.

The stop limit ",2018-09-23
6,redditisacleansite,e6hwzrv,/r/pennystocks/comments/9i9gcz/what_the_difference_between_limit_order_and_a/e6hwzrv/,1,"Limit sell: this will try to sell the stock right away, assuming itâ€™s above the price. So letâ€™s say you place a limit sell at $40, if the stock is currently trading at $48 it will sell for $48 now.

Stop limit: Say you set your stop at $41 and your limit at $40. When it hits $41, it will sell the stock assuming it can fill the order above $40. If something happens and the stock drops from $41.01 to $39.99, and it cannot fill the order above $40, it will not sell your shares. 

Hope that helps!",2018-09-23
7,contikipaul,e6hxasf,/r/pennystocks/comments/9i9gcz/what_the_difference_between_limit_order_and_a/e6hxasf/,1,"So letâ€™s say you own 100 shares of ABC for $40

Stop Limit at $36 to protect against downward fall.   When the Stock hits $36 it triggers a limit order to sell at $36 or above

Stop Loss at $36 to protect against downward fall.   When stock hits $36 it will trigger a market order and sell immediately


Stop limit is good if it is in a long slow steady decline but if you go to bed and ABC was at $40 then bad news overnight and stock opens trading at $31 you are screwed as with a Stop Limit you only have an open limit order at $36.   With a stop loss you would have sold at $32
