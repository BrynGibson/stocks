The 5000$ will show you the more money you put in a trade the faster you can get out with profit. Also it’s easier to scale in and out of trades. Sense I’m not starting with a large amount the 500$ lets me understand the disadvantages of using a small amount. Scaling in is almost impossible. Keeping a good risk to reward is also hard . 
     As for the 100$ the goal is to not lose it . How long/ how many trades can you do with just 100$ . It also keeps FOMO in check and other emotions. 
Rules: apply PDT rule and unsettled funds rules. If you can’t do with real money don’t do it paper. Also add 3 seconds to your trade ( count to 3 ) this is to say you would get filled at the price point you chose. Good luck",2019-09-19

 **SEPTEMBER 21st, 2019**

**FOR IMMEDIAE RELEASE:**

To Our Valued Clients:

We are truly sorry for the interruption in business caused by the unexpected suspension of our licence by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (""SCB""). The suspension is intended to be temporary pending the resolution of a few concerns recently raised by the SCB.

The SCB has scheduled a meeting with the firm's management for Tuesday, September 24th, to discuss their concerns and our proposed resolutions. We believe that we will have a productive meeting.

The concerns expressed to us are **not** about the firm's liquidity or solvency. We confirm that we are able to very easily meet our obligations.

We hope to return to normalcy by mid next week.

Thank you,

Management",2019-09-19

SEPTEMBER 23rd, 2019
 

Dear Valued Clients,
 
We have good news. By court order, our suspension has been lifted and trading has resumed.
 
We will also resume normal business operations tomorrow, Tuesday September 24, and our priority will be to ensure that all client queries, concerns and requests are responded to in a timely manner.
 
Our customer service team will be available on live chat from 8:30AM to 7PM EST. All emails will be answered in the order received, and we ask for your patience as we work to process the backlog of requests.
 
We do expect longer than normal wait times, but we assure you that the team will do its best to respond to all chats, emails and telephone calls.
 
If you were in a trade and not able to close your position during the temporary suspension, please email trading@suretrader.com and the management team will review each case individually for remediation.
 
Given the circumstances, we will not be charging trade commissions and withdrawal fees will be waived until further notice.
 
Again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this suspension has caused and we will continue to keep you updated as we work to service clients.  
 
Sincerely,
 
Management",2019-09-19
