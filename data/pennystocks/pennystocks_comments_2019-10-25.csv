And as for acquisitions there is nothing in the works but I believe the value of both of those assets along with their extremely low valuation makes them a prime buyout target. Ps. Narcan (the last fda approved naloxone product) got sold for like $600m or something like that.,2019-10-25

33,obeseoprah,f58hjy2,/r/pennystocks/comments/dmy8ci/admp/f58hjy2/,1,I think Symjepi has some promise if it starts gaining any share from the dreaded Mylan or Mylar or whatever itâ€™s called. The Narcan on steroids could be big or it could be too late to the party. I think they have 2 years of cash burn left if nothing changes. The delisting threat scares me. But the promise of something at 80 cents possibly going to $3.00 again is enticing.,2019-10-25
