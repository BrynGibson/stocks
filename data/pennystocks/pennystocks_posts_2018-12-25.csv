1,If a company does 25:1 reverse split what happens if I have 24 shares or less?,a9c162,marijuanasales,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a9c162/if_a_company_does_251_reverse_split_what_happens/,1,14,"I’m fairly new and trying to learn this. So basically 25:1 RS means for every 25 shares I get to keep 1. So if I had 50 shares I now have 2? Correct? But what happens in that case, or any case. If the person doesn’t have enough shares to what they’re splitting? Does that mean they keep all their shares and value goes up?

2,EKSO?,a9bh5w,I_Will_Steal_Yo_Girl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a9bh5w/ekso/,1,2,"Been holding some losses and it slid another 10% today... is there any future here? I guess I might just hold until it goes to zero I don’t have a big position. 

Their technology is great but I’m worried that a much larger player will be able to easily recreate what they have with enough money, and there are other players in the whole idea of using a robot to help disabled people walk. I like their other product though that helps laborers but i think it’s too early for mass adoption. Shit is too pricy. 

Their year over year revenues are growing on the bright side, but it seems they have spent more on marketing than in 2017. I just think this is a complete crapshoot if it pans out. Decent amounts of insider buying too to add to my mixed feelings. I think over a decade I’m bullish, but they’re gonna need a lot more money to keep going and somethings gonna have to change for them to turn a profit. It seems to be a matter of Will they go bankrupt or not before the world is ready for their products. 

Anyone else own this stock? I’m feeling pretty bearish. ",2018-12-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a9bh5w/ekso/
