Invest in this company, flip it before it crashes for sure.  But lets not hyping this like they've got some huge edge on everyone is ridiculous.

The fact of the matter is that some companies and individuals are extremely good at logistics, or manufacturing, or technological skill, etc. so they go into business into that speciality. Apparently Bitmain feels their competitive advantage in the marketplace is in their manufacturing/logistics and they do extremely well. It is much easier to manufacture and sell thousands of units than to mine with them. No upkeep and no headache of keeping the rig running.
