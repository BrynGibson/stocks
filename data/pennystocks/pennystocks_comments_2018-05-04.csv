I’d suggest you use ameritrade to trade paper money. It is likely you’re inexperienced and trading without set limits paired with limited research. There are tons of resources out there with a quick google or YouTube search but if you want to just jump into it, trade paper money and see how well you do without the risk of losing actual money. If you can remain positive over the course of a few months you might be able to trade real money and make a profit. There are a few apps like Stash and Acorns if you want to ease into investment without much risk. The two apps also do a decent job of teaching investment in sizeable bites.
