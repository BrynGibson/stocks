**SACRAMENTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 15, 2019 /** Falcon Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: FLCN) announced today that it has signed an exclusive worldwide license to use the domain names maximumstrengthcbd.com and extendedreleasecbd.com to market, sell and distribute its CBD products. The licensing agreement will provide Falcon with a competitive advantage over other companies selling CBD using the world side web. 

As part of the company's overall marketing strategy, Falcon is striving on a daily basis to be able to place its soon to be launched CBD products in front of as many consumers as possible. In order to do this, the company is hyper-focused on gaining marketing and advertising advantages over the many other companies that are selling CBD products using the Internet. These domain names are important, but yet are a small component of the company's overall plan. 

As Falcon recently announced, the company signed a two year worldwide license to use the Real Hemp brand and trademark to market, sell and distribute hemp products using the Real Hemp brand. If the company meets certain sales volumes, Falcon will be able to invoke a purchase option for the Real Hemp trademark, which it plans on executing.

Up until a few short months ago, most hemp products on shelves in the United States were imported into the United States. However, the 2018 Farm Bill legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp and removed it from the list of controlled substances. 

Industrial hemp contains all of the cannabinoids in medical marijuana but unlike marijuana, industrial hemp is low in THC (tetrahydrocannabinol - the psychoactive component in marijuana). Some strains of industrial hemp are also rich in CBD (cannabidiol), the cannabinoid which has been featured in hundreds of news stories for its therapeutic potential to potentially treat serious medical ailments such as epilepsy, cancer, pain, arthritis, and many others. 

The hemp seed and the oil derived from the seed is an excellent source of protein and essential fatty acids. Three tablespoons of hemp seeds contain about 10 grams of protein. The protein from the hemp plant is a more complete protein than proteins found in red meat, chicken and fish. Hemp seeds are sold in national health food and supplements retailers. The stalk of the hemp plant contains two types of fiber. The outer fiber can be processed into long strands which can then be used for textile manufacturing. The inner core which resembles wood can be used for animal bedding. The hemp stalk can also be used as a key component in the manufacturing of paper. 

CBD ( Cannabidiol ) is one of at least 60 active cannabinoids identified in both cannabis and industrial hemp. It is a major constituent of both plants, although the percentages of total composition can vary greatly from strain to strain. Unlike THC (the other prevalent cannabinoid), CBD is non-psychoactive while having the potential to possess a variety of therapeutic properties. 

The market for CBD products and the market for hemp products will be two of the fastest growing sectors of the health and wellness marketplace and Falcon has in just a few short weeks put the company square in the middle of this very large business opportunity. 

William J. Delgado, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Technologies commented, ""We will continue to update the markets on our overall sales and marketing plans as we accomplish important steps in our overall strategy. These domain names are very important because there is no doubt that products that offer CBD in higher doses and with extended release formulations are desired by consumers looking for CBD products. As we launch the websites associated with these domain names, our products will be easily found by consumers.""

Mr. Delgado added, ""We will be announcing a strategy related to product sales on Amazon within the next four weeks.""
