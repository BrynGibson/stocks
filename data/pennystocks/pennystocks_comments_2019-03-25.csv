96,investornaut,ejdzgfg,/r/pennystocks/comments/b5hs3i/four_pennies_i_have_my_eye_on_this_week/ejdzgfg/,1,"I have a few accounts and try and separate them as best I can. For example I have an options account in TastyWorks, an e-trade for my long investments that I have held for 10+ years and my Schwab which I use for penny stocks. Specifically for penny stocks I started in 2013 but didn't go really heavy until 2016. 

In 2016 I took 5 grand stupidly threw it into DRYs and doubled my money in a single day. Was a terrible decision but worked out in my favor but definitely the riskiest trade that I have ever taken and have learned a lot since then. My schwab account has tripled since then and I have reallocated the account three times to take profits and slide into longer positions into companies like KO, T, AMZN, JNJ. 

My biggest win for a penny stock is 5% as I‚Äôve never let them run beyond that. Mostly though I lock in 3%. My biggest loss was a MNKD play I got into and due to my own error of not setting a stop loss alert I missed a fairly decent cliff dive and ate a 22% loss.  In 2018 I traded 82 different times and only took 3 losses, broke even on 4 trades and took 1% profits on 16 trades. 2% profit on 3 trades, 5% profit on 9 trades and the rest were sold at 3%.  The positions are usually 5k but sometimes if the set up is really nice I will go 7-10k and watch very closely.  The profits aren‚Äôt sexy, most of the time its 100-300.00 and for example today I entered BIOC at $1.00 and sold at $1.03. $150 bucks for just clicking a few buttons isn‚Äôt bad IMO. The wins add up over time.

As far as how I learned this stuff I studied charts like crazy with Money Flow Index(MFI) and it became my main indicator that had to be on every chart no matter what. MFI tells when a stock is oversold and overbought and on penny stocks its pretty accurate. Buy when oversold and a reversal signal occurs and then sell in the momentum. I use it with a lot of other stuff today too, especially Exponential moving averages (EMA‚Äôs). There is a plethora of knowledge on the internet, youtube specifically about charting. Ignore all the penny hype magic. I tried to ignore the meme stocks that were getting pumped especially after the DRY‚Äôs fiasco and instead just focused on what I could screen. I created a post about how to set up a free screener in Tradingview. If you need a screener that is my MFI one and it‚Äôs solid. Screened all these in this post.

Hope this info helps!

I guess a level 2 access is  mandatory for that. Do you know of any free versions that I can use? I am from Europe and I am not sure if I can get thinkorswim and if it includes EU Stockmarkets. Scalping seems quite nice but are you also doing some swing trading over the course of a couple of days weeks? How much time are you investing into trading?

107,investornaut,ejevgjo,/r/pennystocks/comments/b5hs3i/four_pennies_i_have_my_eye_on_this_week/ejevgjo/,1,Yeah I use Thinkorswim. Not sure of any alternatives that might meet your requirements. I spend more time trading options but for pennies I usually spend 30mins-1hr on Sunday nights looking for some set-ups. Then set limit buys and whenever the buy hits I'll set a limit sell and a stop loss alert. Then I'll spend another 1 hour or so in the week screening on Tues night or wed. night.  Not a whole lot of time spent on penny stocks. ,2019-03-25

Right now I spend pretty much 6hrs everyday just reading and watching videos to educate myself after work. But would be fun to start a little penny account and do this on the side.

Thanks a lot!

Could you please explain what would be the best route of action with these penny stocks for a simple week long plan? For example, on Robinhood, FCEL is at $0.30 and it started at $0.32 this week (20th). Are you predicting that by the start of next week, it will jump up a few pennies so being invested in something like 500 shares will be worth it?

Would you even recommend a beginner to start with penny stocks since it appears you really have to invest in 500-1000 shares to really make value of your money?

Thanks in advance!",2019-03-25

You can definitely buy 500-1000 shares but at 30 cents that won't really see a lot of profit. You might be better off using that money to scalp ITM options.
