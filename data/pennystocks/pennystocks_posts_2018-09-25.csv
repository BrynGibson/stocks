## Nutra Pharma is providing an update on the work of EuroAmerican IP, LLC to create awareness and sales into military and governmental buyers

CORAL SPRINGS, Fla., Sept. 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- [Nutra Pharma Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wo32p5XuC5Y7Va3XH5CtuQUVnctrIF84UDwvfARUV1KmHJmH8-mj_-vK07UsWIAkGlj2R5PFCXiu-GO5d9ZE8fbt9G6Qh285keoQcGD2IuQ=)(OTC: NPHC), a biotechnology company marketing [Nyloxin®](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5QfQwgJ7rpRdzm7JXa4lWt2JfAarwilvnDqWM1HHSiHYvJol-KLbTCL1mDd43tCLn_xfGQpPq-NXRTZXmYrXRw==) and [Pet Pain-Away™](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rYTRy8fUU_Il7uReerQMNk5MuMG4UfHzJBO3COkV_-GVTkoAYfa8carqDVt77OtP-dbPTt_CBZw92n1jir03YQ==) in the over-the-counter (OTC) pain management market, announced today that their work with EuroAmerican IP, LLC has resulted in a listing of their Nyloxin® product line on the website, [www.GoVets.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Q1gNubV7EtJn6S8E_dodaq39-GSHoKEUAQIbigeHdep3SAwC5NVhf1wHrHzCq7N3IJoYV2TVVzDsKR8K-jQ4yQ==).  


“With the nation focused on the reduction of opiate use and the treatment of chronic pain, especially for veterans, Nyloxin should go a long way to effectively managing chronic pain symptoms for many of our wounded warriors and reducing their use of opiate drugs,” stated Rik J Deitsch, CEO of Nutra Pharma. “Our work with EuroAmerican is beginning to bear fruit as they begin to distribute our products directly to various organizations, agencies and health departments,” he continued. “We will continue to work to get Nyloxin into the hands of those who need it most; with a focus on providing Nyloxin as a real solution to the opioid crisis,” he concluded.

GoVets is the online marketplace under the National Veteran Small Business Coalition (NVSBC) to buy from VA-verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs). EuroAmerican has teamed with BioArmor, LLC as the SDVOSB Company who established a Vendor Marketplace Agreement with the GoVets Program. Thus providing the capability to market and sell the Nyloxin product Line in the GoVets Program. [GoVets](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WBcomPlFeL4geH3sd8XnAtfHBeKA8danbns3K3QzmmzbaXH_DqTYVV-vCCOutjspz6DUrLBU7t8MENm4w_rGeQ==) provides an easy to use platform for government agencies to make micro-purchases. With a newly raised micro-purchase threshold from $3.5K to $10K for civilian agencies, the NVSBC is working to ensure that this platform becomes the electronic ordering marketplace of choice for the VA and other federal agencies. The Nyloxin products can be found directly at: [https://tinyurl.com/nyloxin-govets](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ByWajA60muxuYOGtLurF-WxFi5tKeHzyUMjs35XAuPeSyubccYp9NFz1_vwfEYb_AVor3ZKJRwOz-GiAjoxHlf9pIv_jvS3aXHhJJUSaNzrtusZlMZ7GaKyHI7tOzCdN)

Nyloxin® is a safe, non-narcotic, and non-addictive Homeopathic pain reliever clinically proven to treat moderate to severe chronic pain while not impairing cognitive function. Nyloxin® offers several benefits as pain relievers and anti-inflammatory agents. With increasing concern about consumers using opioid and acetaminophen-based pain relievers, Nyloxin® offers an alternative that does not rely on opiates or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, otherwise known as NSAIDs, for their pain relieving effects. Nyloxin® has a well-defined safety profile. Since the early 1930s, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Asian cobra venom, has been studied in more than 46 human clinical studies.

“We have loved working with Nutra Pharma,” commented Debra J Paul, CEO of EuroAmerican. “Nyloxin is an exciting alternative to opiate drugs. We believe that it can be a significant tool for combatting opioids in our veterans and in our military,” she continued. “We have seen that Nyloxin substantially reduces all types of pain without mental confusion, addiction or toxicity. We have been working diligently to add the Nyloxin products to our existing product list for broad distribution to organizations, agencies and other governmental buyers,” she concluded.
