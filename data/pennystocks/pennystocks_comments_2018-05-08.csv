TD ameritrade had no news at all for even the occurrence of the meeting. This is the first of 2 meetings so nothing yet. ,2018-05-08

If the float is locking up this tight and looking at .07 support this may have more gas left in the tank. I’m hopping back in, just not as heavily as I did before.",2018-05-08

From the twitter page of the company facilitating the merger :) 

“We have reached agreements with the merge-in company. Official press releases will commence by Wednesday of next week. 

Megola inc. $MGON”",2018-05-08

It was trading .009-.012 when you were posting last. 

Today it was sitting around .0175 with news, which I was expecting. They announced Wednesday they would give us more news . This thing should run over .02+ with news Wednesday of the company merging in.  I’d expect a decent buying opportunity Monday-Tuesday when there’s no news - just saying. 

With mergers there doesn’t always need to be a great match. It’ll run with hype to a point either way. But this seems to be a good hold

Good luck to your trading ventures either way bud  ",2018-05-08

Good luck yourself! Maybe my penny stocks will have more elevation gains than you’re about to be experiencing at base camp. Sadly their base camp is much higher than any mountains I have on the east coast. ",2018-05-08
