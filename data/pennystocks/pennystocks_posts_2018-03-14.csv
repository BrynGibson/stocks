3,Technical Trading,84djme,bighdaddie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/84djme/technical_trading/,3,0,"From ""The Caller"" March 13, 2018
""Digging deeper into the American Cryostem Corp (CRYO) ‘s technical indicators, we note that the Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -81.82. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. A reading between 0 and -20 would point to an overbought situation. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. The Williams %R was developed by Larry Williams. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. ""

I am a long term investor in CRYO and looking for a buyout next year in the $4-$6 range, but I think there is a trade in it now to $.80 on the short term.

8,MSNVF Update,84d5wb,TheHammerIsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/84d5wb/msnvf_update/,4,0,"I posted two days ago regarding if anyone else here had taken a look at Mission Ready Services (MSNVF). Coincidentally, the company released an abundance of news last night via an investor presentation. 
The price point ($0.224 USD) has slowly been dropping over the last month because of fear that a $400 million PO was off the table. This presentation clearly shows the PO announcement is very near. This along with a few other deals have investors giddy. 

Take a look for yourself and do your own DD but figured I'd make others aware of this because I've received a tremendous amount of help from this subreddit
