(LUVU)",gd4oj2,marcyleena,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gd4oj2/total_noob_here_first_post_luvu_brands_luvu/,1,3,"Hi everybody 👋  Deployed soldier with lots of free time here.  I'm in CENTCOM at present, so market hours run conveniently from 1630 to 2300.  I've opened my first ever trading account(s) and am hoping to use the pandemic as an opportunity to get started in investing.  Apart from my DoD TSP, which is temporarily in government securities, I am looking at some long term holds as well as trying to play some short term profits on these volatile rallys/pumps.  I know little to nothing about trading, so please go easy on me.

Anyway, my reason for posting - Luvu brands (LUVU).  They were stuck around a penny up until early 2020 before seeing some growth, then crashed with the rest of the market.  Surprisingly, over the last few weeks the stock has gone from around $.05 to a peak of $.19.  This past week it dropped back around $.13. They are known for Liberator, the popular sex pillow/furniture brand but recently pivoted to manufacture face masks as well.  Kinda comical to consider, a bunch of people trapped inside must be passing the time by making quarantine babies. 😉  But have all the interested buyers made their purchases already, and their sales will taper off?  Or is the stock growing because of face mask production?

Should I wait for it to drop back down to around $.05?  Ignore it?  Or buy in now and see where it goes?  Thoughts/opinions?  Wanted to share a stock that I (a COMPLETE noob to trading) think might be a winner.  But I would like some outside opinions.  Thanks.",2020-05-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gd4oj2/total_noob_here_first_post_luvu_brands_luvu/

2,An Island Nation of Redditors with Legalized Drugs,gd4mtm,OGKebabEater,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gd4mtm/an_island_nation_of_redditors_with_legalized_drugs/,1,6," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

RESULTS:
Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In Case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In Case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.

My question is, where are you traders trading from after you’ve outgrown RH, or been without RH?

I’m no expert, but I’m getting the hang of trading pretty well. Using indicators outside of reddit posts now, wheeling options, have almost doubled my investment thus far, and now I’m starting to really see the restrictions of Robinhood. It’s been a good app for what it is, learned a lot from it, but I believe I need something bigger now. Especially when you can’t buy for several hours after actual pre-market. And I’m noticing that, for example, MVIS was listed at $0.51 on RH and $0.44 on other listings as of yesterday afternoon. So I’m still laying a premium.

Where are you guys going? Been researching WeBull, they sound like the earliest open premarket. I have ToS, but not funded. Just looking for opinions.

130,BIOC Biocept Research: Uptrend in Biocept Price Action from 8-13 May Probable,gddv3a,Cicero1982,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gddv3a/bioc_biocept_research_uptrend_in_biocept_price/,1,46,"Prediction: From 8-13 May there will be a steady uptrend in BIOC Price Action before Earnings are expected after hours on the 13th.

Supporting Evidence:

1. On April 9th 2020 BIOC Biocept reported the following: “On April 9, 2020, Biocept, Inc. issued a press release announcing that the Company has verified a COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test and plans to begin accepting physician-ordered testing requests for processing beginning on April 15, 2020.” This news is nearly a month old now and share holders have had no update as to the COVID testing. Therefore investors are still waiting on news of the COVID tests.

Analysis: If their previous report was true news should be coming soon on COVID tests. This will likely be reported during ER. Bulls will want to get in and shorts will want to get out before Friday the 8th. Producing the COVID news should, if positive, launch the share price much higher (from $0.37 to at minimum $0.55 [likely much higher])

2. The three offerings in the last two months are still fresh on the minds of shareholders, and are why this security is still trading low.

Analysis: Why is this supporting evidence? The three recent offerings likely mean that they have plenty of funding. They announced over a month ago that they had enough funding until Q1 2021. They should now have much more than that. This will be reported during ER and bulls will likely give them a boost with the knowledge that they won’t need to raise money for a while (NOTE: History has shown that they raise money frequently so don’t count on them forgoing an offering if a significant catalyst is in play). Moreover there is a low to moderate chance that the most recent offerings were released with the knowledge that future news of their COVID-19 testing will bump up their share price at ER. 

Note: I’m Not Worried About a Reverse Split Until After June 5th:

Analysis: Sure they could have been in compliance had they not tanked their own stock three times in two months but fortunately they are putting the reverse split decision to the shareholders on  June 5th 2020. BIOC must be in compliance by June 30th 2020. So there is no immediate threat to shareholders of a R/S before June 5th. 

3. The EU has given BIOC the thumbs up on their Target Selector kits. The status of this will also likely be reported at ER. There relevant press release stated the following: “The CE Mark confirms that the Target Selector kit products meet the requirements of the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive and allows Biocept to commercialize its kits throughout the European Union and other CE Mark geographies”

Analysis: A positive update on the Target Selector Kits will likely give BIOC a solid boost during ER. Particularly if they get help in marketing them. Bulls will be looking for this at ER. 

Conclusion: There is plenty here to drive the shorts out and bring the bulls in to $BIOC after Friday the 8th of May. The chance that there will be a steady uptrend in BIOC Price Action before Earnings on the 13th is therefore probable.

When I first started trading pennies, I did this a lot. As time went on, I eventually realized that the process was something like this:

First, you see it.

Then, you're too conservative / doubtful / cautious, you think, ""What if it's nothing""?

Then it gets popular, it goes way up.

Then you FOMO like 60%-100% later.

After a FOMO entry, the potential risk gets bigger because of a growing mountain of potential profit-takers who got in early and the impending possibility rumor being false or the news being underwhelming. people respond more swiftly to this risk the high the price goes.

If you had just gone in early, the worst you could've done was maybe lose some commissions depending on your broker and tie up cash that could've gone to something else.

When you FOMO you can lose much more.

And that's my experience on how I often used to, and probably still unintentionally do occasionally FOMO.",2020-05-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gdhdq6/my_view_on_fomoing/

183,Serious Question: How many stocks have actually made it that were featured in this sub?,gdghl0,Ghost_InThe_Machine,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gdghl0/serious_question_how_many_stocks_have_actually/,1,12,"Hi all,
 I have been a very long time member of this sub and this is the sub that got me started with investing\trading. Needless to say that the optimism in this sub is always something to behold. I started back in the days of BVTK, DCTH and OMVS. If anyone from here still remembers those stocks, you will know that a lot of money was lost, I did make some money on OMVS and DCTH and broke even on BVTK. It took a year to get out of BVTK and AZFL. Making money off of OMVS and DCTH was not an easy thing, I was bag holding and averaging down a lot. I caught a break when the stocks were being pumped and got out quickly with a small profit, definitely not worth the headache it caused. I learned my lesson and moved away from pennies and on to more grounded stocks, made some money there but also lost. (Fucking DIS). 

Here is the part that you guys might hate me for, but please understand, I am in this solely for the purpose of making money. Whenever I see a stock that is being pushed by this sub, I wait for it to get as high as I think it can, and then short it when possible (can't always get the stocks, most are hard to borrow) but since I have been doing that, I have not lost a penny :-) and made a lot of money. For example, I saw AYTU getting pushed, shorted it and made off like a bandit. I know nothing about these stocks or companies, simply looking at charts and what you guys say here. This morning I saw the numerous posts for MVIS, again, never heard of this stock or company, I looked at its charts and saw that there was no ACTUAL news on this company, just a rumor. Sharpened up my teeth and shorted the stock at 1.00 and covered at 0.94. In and out, have a small profit, but it is a good day's work. I do this several times a week (not all are pennies). YES, There is a serious risk that this goes south quickly, but in two years, I never had that happen. 

So, back to the subject at hand, in all the years of this sub, how many stocks have actually made it? I am genuinely curious because I see people still holding out for stocks that will go to the moon. I am not advising anyone on what to do, but would it not be more profitable to buy and sell (quick turn around) and walk away with profits? I mean I spun stocks and made $13 profits, but that is way better than holding out for something that might not happen and +13 is way better than -13.

I genuinely hope I did not piss anyone off, not my intentions, Just had a question of if a stock from this sub actually hit big, how often it happens and hopefully maybe share some of my personal insights of how I use this sub.",2020-05-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gdghl0/serious_question_how_many_stocks_have_actually/

Has anyone ever has shares in a company that merged? If so, what happened to the share price? Up or down? I have a little invested in the stock right now, but I can’t seem to find anything else about the merger that would point to a price target of $9...
