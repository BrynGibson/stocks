RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LandStar, Inc. ([OTCPK: LDSR](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z58-pyPVm5IPShroeIVO8z3dBqRMUiN0Buj6_fsVZxzK6fY9ihYDkBS5rOcXTmI6NrQ9diBt-R_UzqEQ_XGQJvYEuwkmjoGS8UTKy7Z5I2Y=)) (“LandStar” or the “Company”), the parent company of [Data443™ Risk Mitigation, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1Ydht-wylf9oivESOmAumek4A_BOZa_UDAhhAjpFMKg0Xy5c1MM-p367IxnyjzDzVzLGOLH1OT0yaX1IGbv0RbXc7L4MZZz5j7FlFAIx4Ro=) (“Data443”), a leading data security and privacy company, announced today that Data443 has formed a strategic partnership with leading Turkish technology services company CYNOKS Information Technologies. Experts in risk management and security, CYNOKS serves an array of international and Turkey-based organizations, delivering complex IT security solutions including network, data, and endpoint security, as well as data leak prevention, and more. The partnership comes at a time when Turkey’s IT security market is poised for double-digit growth according to a report published by International Data Corporation (IDC) entitled [“Turkey IT Security Solutions Market 2017–2021 Forecast and Adoption Trends”](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KI46k7juG1324N0dRf2dhK2NxqNbKRhV8WmRhPPHMxHTlAj2MQJa6tcdnYn76ZQ-cA_O25hgDWAPGthBSQM7c3jyAg974FEq_q4JpqfHTuby29Y3XFFNzDqVbiRBVOmOpYlyvLUHHI1IZftD2TvpNJQmdpal_HDIY7WPPVvgGbrcsqDMvwKdYl851Y5rwwxnBvA5JLioB_H1JVjHk5-vp88BHZwcswBPgJ7KgaRcQ0o=). As noted in the report, IDC expects Turkey’s IT security market to grow at a rate of 11.4 percent through 2021 from $233.2 million in 2017. CYNOKS is well positioned to deliver opportunities for Data443 as demand for IT security solutions expands in Turkey and across the region.  


“Data security has become increasingly important in Turkey and throughout the neighboring areas,” said Jason Remillard, CEO of LandStar and founder of Data443. “The Turkish government is making huge strides to [implement information and communication technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mzVd6UIQZYz2Ch9JDXDDL8kJs9YAkU3JjlJnlpfe1ywooiOYaPnVKzbbm51Dz8pPps_FBaGRDiPMW1yGFvOzD5V2yEZ9QbMd_RvTSORawBuoHxlS4HsF4jSei2InY7LHXqnTXQnCdZTyUiDKN2lhrqQJxfe68sl-yjIV0q25fgo=) over the next five years, and while the country is not part of the European Union, the [Turkish Data Protection Law](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7pX5GzLnAZeL_DpbyATnagI0sMRjn5Uoxwcf8ZH8qNzufv7cg40U0hiBvMWJ9kSxtRVGldZqKSBy0iQZrc22yc6Di8JUvg4HnYFS_yvcidlucxPj-egb0x2M_w123-0JoWcfNNC-vxSGcVd0R6Cz_IJweam1n65qmNuDXlw0cX8=) and cross-border requirements to adhere to GDPR standards is driving demand. CYNOKS is well established and has proven expertise in delivering future-proof security solutions. We are thrilled to work with them as we extend coverage to this important high-growth market.”

The Turkish Data Protection Law (DPL) went into force in April and [fines](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ezlBs4Faqwx-KPdEtF212xOwQOQi-4ZfWVRVYcPxk5XAH6eoGULqC8SzoaGOY9RFxq5dePWxbszjAve7VjnawY5Van9x-ZZR3krWLnOXCNrNiQzdSOG84mt2AzC2nbsiiJTA1xHJjs-59ycyLnsxFzilzu252AUye5gLN5yWQDs=) are already being imposed for issues such as late notification of data breach, lack of or late response to data subject access requests (DSARs), and unlawful data sharing among others. At the same time, [IDC notes](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_F3XEkTnBU76lkFgkB4B2q-S4g0gJ_80wFBCM-XcdbIvjIWuQZ5ol7yhb59-ixLTs2f3ykyZLGMrOuzCgNxgWKdhHw7cPFxl-sErDxSpqeR1p56qpqfWKv4_KSPSt0zF) that most Turkish organizations have yet to implement solutions to comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which would ensure more effective data management practices overall. Yet the risks are real.

“Data security is no longer confined to a single point such as a database or file,” said Mustafa Utku GÖKER, General Manager at CYNOKS. “Organizations that are faced with multiple compliance regulations such as the DPL and GDPR must now secure and govern data across multiple points, continuously and in real time. This is why we are so excited to work with Data443. The Data443 product portfolio delivers unique capabilities in data compliance, protection, and governance that remove many of the hurdles companies face when confronting these issues.”

LAS VEGAS, Jan. 02, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dakshidin Corporation (DKSC) is pleased to announce that it has completed the acquisition of Whitechapel Holdings, Inc. (Whitechapel), a Delaware Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  


The subsidiaries consist of:

* Laughing Frogs, the exclusive online sales portal for all of Whitechapel’s legal, unique and proprietary organic CBD products. Laughing Frogs also manages fast growing distribution channel programs in the retail distribution, reselling and direct sales market segments. The company has managed to secure a merchant account with a nationwide bank, something which is still difficult for the CBD/Cannabis industry, and expects to have a fully integrated online sales portal in the next few weeks. For now people can call a toll free number to order: ​Laughingfrogs.com​.
* Runnymede Farms, which is in the process of acquiring a 193-acre farm in Northern California that is licensed to legally cultivate Cannabis. Runnymede has secured the first $500,000 required for the transaction to be completed. The current management of Runnymede Farms, which has substantial expertise in the cultivation of marijuana, has agreed to stay involved and will take an active role in overseeing said cultivation.

Whitechapel CEO Chris Haigh stated: “As a management team we are very excited to be able to move forward as a result of this transaction. Whitechapel believes that,​ Cannabis and CBD are mainstream products being consumed by a mainstream clientele; we believe that trusted brands will be the future of the cannabis industry. Furthermore we believe that the end of cannabis prohibition is inevitable, the industry is still in its infancy and we plan to capitalize significantly on its potential for sustainable growth.”

Spending on legal cannabis worldwide is expected to hit $57 billion by 2027 and in North America, sales are projected to rise from $9.2 billion in 2017 to $47.3 billion by 2027, according to Arcview Market Research and its research partner BDS Analytics.

The company will announce the changes in management soon and is working diligently on getting current with all regulatory filings.
