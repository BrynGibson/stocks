24,homeproav,fiakshj,/r/pennystocks/comments/f76xan/simple_questions_february_21_2020/fiakshj/,1,"Hi, new on here as of today.  While I‚Äôve done quite a bit of dabbling lately with options, I typically consider myself an investor and not a trader. I like high risk/high reward position trades, typically with a 3-12 month hold time, along with some bigger long term hold positions. I‚Äôve just poked around on here today, and it looks like most of the stocks I‚Äôve seen mentioned are what I consider ‚Äúgarbage penny stocks‚Äù.  Companies that will most likely never make money, with prices that are manipulated in ways that can‚Äôt be accurately predicted or controlled (unless you are an A1 chart reader, which I am not). You can make good money at these if you know what you‚Äôre doing (I haven‚Äôt figured out how to do it, but I know it can be done), but I‚Äôm not into most of these. What I AM interested are legit companies that have been beaten down in the market, even under a dollar, but are legit companies with legit possibility of making lots of money.  Nothing that‚Äôs ‚Äúpre-revenue‚Äù, you know? The most recent example of this that I‚Äôve taken a position in is $SENS.  A legit company with a superior medical product that has recently gotten coverage with Medicare, Cigna, and lots of others (only holdout is UHC). They went all the way down to $.80, but I knew they were legit and their prospects are very bright. I have made a ton of money off of it and I will accumulate more shares and ride it up to 20, 50, and hopefully $100/share (based on competitor market caps). My question is, does anyone have any recommendations on other legit micro caps that are highly undervalued at the moment? I don‚Äôt want to trade, I‚Äôm looking for longer term investments that I can research and be satisfied that they will outperform the market by huge margins.  Anyone have any suggestions?",2020-02-21

My question is... when should I sell when it comes to these cheaper stocks?  I have a few where my equity position went up really well on a specific day but then dropped the following day.  I feel like I should have sold but I never know if I should pull the trigger.  \\

For these really small stocks, I feel like I'm gambling with less money...but I dunno

Example... I bought 13 shares of ZN for $4.70.  My position has only gone as high as $6 and now it's back down to $2.93 (as of this writing).  It's a tiny amount of stock, I know... but do I hold and wait to see if they hit closer to their 52 week high ($1.20) or just wait until my equity is back at $6 and trade for something else?

Again I know this is just a small potatoes sort of thing and changes would be much more obvious with higher volumes.

31,homeproav,fiaq62g,/r/pennystocks/comments/f76xan/simple_questions_february_21_2020/fiaq62g/,1,"My experience is that if you don‚Äôt have a plan before you start, you are generally not going to go anywhere.  My strategy for dummies is this:
1) Research stocks that are trading at 52 week lows. There are several websites that will show you this info.  Google is your friend. 
2) Of those stocks, look through and find which ones you recognize (household name type stocks).  Also look for the ones that have dropped they most from their high (down at least over 40% is a good metric).  
3)Of all of these stocks you‚Äôve found, see if there are any that you believe will go back up, and make a determination of how far back up you think it‚Äôs likely they will go. Look at one year and 5 year charts, and look at previous levels. Read up and find out why the stocks went down in the first place, and if the situation if permanent or if it was an overreaction by the market. For me, most times I don‚Äôt ever consider that the stocks will go back to their previous levels (unless I am taking a very long term position, which is somewhat rare for me).  Sometimes they do, but I usually end up leaving money on the table. It‚Äôs just part of the strategy. What I‚Äôm looking for mostly are opportunities for a 20-25% appreciation over 3-6 months.  It‚Äôs more common than you think, even with bigger stocks.  In penny stocks it‚Äôs EXTREMELY common (though I usually don‚Äôt invest in those unless they are real, high quality companies with real earnings prospects).  
4)If any stocks pass your screening and researching, invest the percentage of your portfolio that your comfortable with. This percentage will get smaller over time as your portfolio gets larger. A helpful tip that I don‚Äôt practice nearly enough is to ‚Äúscale in‚Äù, and not buy your entire position all at once. That way, if the stock keeps going down for a while, you can take advantage and lower your price average. 
5)Once you have bought your entire position, set a limit order for the stock at your target price (mine is usually current stock price times 1.2-1.25).  
6)Don‚Äôt check the stock everyday. Just let it go and you‚Äôll just eventually get a notification on your phone that your stock sold off.  
7)Rinse and repeat.

This is not the typical advice of a penny stock trader, but it‚Äôs sound investing advice, and works well for me.

I try to cycle my entire portfolio through this process about 3 times a year, been at it about 3 years. Try to ignore the daily ups and downs of the market and your particular stocks (that‚Äôs the hardest part) and you‚Äôll be fine.

I‚Äôm mainly a ‚Äúvalue investor‚Äù of sorts, meaning that I‚Äôm looking for companies that are unusually and unfairly beaten down or otherwise undervalued.  Sometimes you just see stories in the news, reports of a company taking a big hit in the market (like Under Armour a week or two ago). From there just read read read to investigate the stock. Find out other people‚Äôs take on the stock. StockTwits is decent to get a gauge of how much interest there is in a stock, and to get additional due diligence that others have done. Just be careful, there are a lot of stock pumpers and badgers (some paid, some not) there that do not have your best interests at heart, so never take anything at face value. Other than that, just always keep an eye on finance reports and the news, and just look everywhere you can to find where a stock may be undervalued. Just remember that when you buy a stock that is undervalued, there will probably be a lot of negative sentiment, which will make it difficult to hold on unless you have done your due dilligence.  Holding Tesla stock last year was difficult when some analyst came out and said there was a case for TSLA to go down to $10.  It was heavily shorted and went very low, which was the best time to buy. Look at it now at $900. I didn‚Äôt hold it to this level, but I did make a lot of money from it. You need to be confident in your research and ignore the press and other traders sometimes. Mostly you just have to train your mind to always be on the lookout for opportunities.  They are always out there!",2020-02-21

118,homeproav,fiqba2l,/r/pennystocks/comments/f76xan/simple_questions_february_21_2020/fiqba2l/,1,"Lol, that wasn‚Äôt really long-winded at all.

Anyway- I think you came up with a perfect example of what I was talking about.  It looks like $R is extremely oversold.  Fundamentals, at first glance, seem to be good, and according to your due diligence, there are some very bright spots in future earnings potential that seem as if they haven‚Äôt been priced in yet. I think it could give you a very easy 20-25% price appreciation on your investment within 6 months.  The one thing I noticed was that there is apparently an earnings loss expected for the first quarter of 2020.  You might want to listen to the last earnings call or read the transcript of that to see what that is all about, see why the guidance was lowered like that. This is most likely priced in at this point, but it‚Äôs worth checking out. Based on what you find there, if you decide to move forward with the investment, I would ‚Äúscale in‚Äù to your position. Buy smaller chunks of your position over the course of a month or so, taking advantage whenever there is a nice price dip. If your broker charges a fee for each transaction, you‚Äôll want to do it in fewer buys, and work that cost into your calculations. If the price doesn‚Äôt go up as expected over 90-180 days, don‚Äôt sweat it.  Extend your timeline, but consider raising your target sell price as well.  If it stays depressed for over 6 months, maybe instead of 20% over a 6 month period, you wait for 40% over a 12 month period.  Keep a sell order in place at your predetermined price target and leave it alone. Don‚Äôt watch it every day, trust me. 9 times out of 10 you will get what you want out of the trade (in my experience, anyway). Of course everyone seems like a genius in a bull market, but this method should work for you in just about any time.
