I believed him too cause he also posted his research every time. People seemed to agree with him too. So I threw in a 1000 bucks at 0.07 and I've been down ever since. I thought he was one of those guys who acts stupid but was actually smart because he always said something like WEEEEEEEEE but now I'm paying the price.

I've invested and done a little due diligence on SHMP. Keep in mind that this is an OTC stock. A few folks have shared OTC stocks on this sub and I'm grateful so I thought I would pay it forward.

SHMP is a publicly traded agro-technology Company headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The Company has developed the first commercially viable system for growing shrimp indoors using patented technology that produce fresh, never-frozen, naturally grown shrimp without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals.

Key things that I have noticed-

​

\-They are the only ones to successfully grow shrimp indoors.

\-They are still waiting to finalize their patent and they have been extending expectations so far.

\-They want to go global with their method which means they could set up facilities anywhere in the world

\-This is a billion dollar industry.

\-They are already producing a product that's beeing sold.
