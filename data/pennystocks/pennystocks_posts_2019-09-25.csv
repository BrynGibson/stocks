**For Immediate Release**

Boca Raton FL-Mike Sherman, producer of the popular weekly celebrity documentary television series, ‚ÄúBefore The Fame‚Äù, is now both the creator and executive producer of a first-of-its-kind reality television series entitled, ‚ÄúHigh School Icon‚Äù. This much-anticipated, exciting new show will showcase the talents of high school students from all around the world with disciplines in music, dance and drama. More importantly, it will detail the social issues that occur in their respective high schools today.

The filming of the project was on location at Slam High School in Miami FL. This school has an affiliation with pop megastar, Pitbull. The production was filled with musical performances from some of the most talented high school students from all over the country. The show will highlight a series of issues that high school students go through everyday including, but not limited to, physical and mental challenges, bullying and cliques along with suicide and depression. The show will allow students to fully express themselves and talk freely about their concerns and struggles with being a student in high school. In addition, the show will infuse music, dance and drama to showcase the importance of the arts in obtaining unity within the student bodies from high schools around the world.

‚ÄúThis was groundbreaking to me. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw!! The stories we heard from these students were so emotional that I actually cried on several occasions. To give these talented kids a voice means the world to me!!‚Äù says Mike Sherman.

Mike Sherman built a great team around him to produce this musical masterpiece. He was accompanied by Michael Gibb, the youngest son of Barry Gibb from the ‚ÄúBee Gees‚Äú, along with Abebe Lewis, son of Reggae legend, Ian Lewis from the band, ‚ÄúInner Circle‚Äù. Of equal importance, the former producer from the Dr. Phil television show, Erin Parker, was an integral part of the overall creative process.

‚ÄúI am so excited about this project. These kids and their stories have not only been amazing, but so inspirational! I can‚Äôt wait for the rest of the world to see it,‚Äù excitedly says Erin Parker, executive producer of the show.

‚ÄúWe will make High School Icon for kids around the nation and across the world so they have a platform to show off their talents and to bring awareness to issues kids face in high schools every day,‚Äù says Michael Gibb.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy to participate in this project as an ambassador of many international charities supporting vulnerable children from all around the world,‚Äù says philanthropist and former model, Aliia Roza, who is one of the judges of the show and a motivational speaker on set.

‚ÄúThis has been a dream of mine for several years and I can‚Äôt believe this is a reality now. We have interest from several major television networks from around the world for syndication and distribution,‚Äù says Mike Sherman.

Where she is now is a great entry point.  There will be pumps in the future and possible M and A. 

My logic is the incentive for their officers to close a deal, etc is pretty frickin high with their heavy bags.  I‚Äôm sure they want to be rich so they‚Äôre probably working on whatever they can to pump this puppy back up
