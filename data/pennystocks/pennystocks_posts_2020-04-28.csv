This ranges from a contract from AMZN or UPS, to maybe an unknown retailer. However, there is nothing to substantiate these rumors that I could find. 

Yes, there is an investor conference call scheduled for 4/30. But this seems like a regular occurrence (11/11/19, 5/15/19, 3/15/19, 11/14/18, etc). Indeed, the language for the announcement of the conference call mirrors the language for past announcements. Meaning, there is nothing in the announcement itself to indicate any kind of big PR release on Thursday. Further, there has been no insider trading on UAVS, which one would expect if there was some kind of huge PR release imminent.

The hype seems to be driving up the stock (at least yesterday leading up to today), but I don't see any long term reason to hold.  Of course, I'm always happy to be proven wrong.",2020-04-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9q7kf/uavs_and_rumors/

There are several reasons to hold these for 3-6 months while continuing with pennies. The primary reasons I‚Äôm buying are as follows:

1. They‚Äôve already seen high amounts of bookings for 3-6 months out indicating a healthy amount of business already to be expected once quarantine lifts

2. All are currently undervalued due to COVID and are ripe for long term gains

3. The government has already worked out bailout plans to keep airlines alive during the quarantine so they‚Äôre a ‚ÄòToo big to fail‚Äô business now

But primarily 4. Many other governments aren‚Äôt taking the same steps as the United States government in terms of financial protection during thus down time. Due to this many foreign airlines will weaken and go under creating massive expansion opportunities for American Airlines.

175,AYTU and lessons learned from DECN,g9quem,jus_in_bello,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9quem/aytu_and_lessons_learned_from_decn/,4,29,"AYTU jumped significantly (300% +) in recent days due in large part to Trump's mentioning of the potential in fighting Covid-19 with internal UV treatment. AYTU also recently announced a partnership with Cedars-Sinai for early testing and research. 

My prediction: This thing will crash and burn, and AYTU will get suspended. 

Here's why. First, the science isn't there. Yes, UV light can kill viruses and bacteria on surfaces. And, it can most likely kill the same inside a person's body. However, given that UV light is the leading cause of skin cancer, imagine what it would do to a person's insides? "" ‚ÄúThis treatment sounds like snake oil to me. To insert light inside the body, orally or through the skin, is likely to cause serious damage to blood cells, muscle tissue, organ tissue and DNA.‚Äù - Crispin Halsall, chemist and professor at Lancaster University. ""Quack medicine.""  - Richard Parsons, senior lecturer in biochemical toxicology at King‚Äôs College London. An example of one of many articles on the subject:  [https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-coronavirus-medicine-science-2645823308.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1](https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-coronavirus-medicine-science-2645823308.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1) 

Second, AYTU has recently come under investigation for fraud by at least to security litigation firms - Brock and Leviton and Glancy Prongay &amp; Murray - because of its recent unsubstantiated claims (which is why their videos are getting removed). I wouldn't be surprised if the SEC is also investigating (remember, they were investigating DECN since March but didn't suspend them until a month later).

PCTI is going through a reverse merger with the ticker symbol $OZSC. Projected revenues this year are $6m, however more contracts are pending. Their IR firm The Waypoint Refinery has spoken about executing Debt Purchase Agreements this week through their twitter, and through these DPAs, all notes will be frozen for 90 days, stopping dilution and allowing debt to be paid off. Once these are executed, expect a flurry of 1-2 press releases per week about upcoming contracts with military clients and progress on the reverse merger. 
https://twitter.com/WaypointThe 

IN MY OPINION, at 100m-120m outstanding shares (projected SS once dilution ends), the pps can rise to 0.10 at least, without multipliers. Through publicity, competent IR, and additional contracts, the stock could easily see 0.60, and with time, 1.00. Today it closed at 0.013. This is a long play, not just another OTC pump and dump. This company has a footing in the industry, and HUGE clients. That being said, the announcement that the DPAs are executed and dilution is frozen will cause it to gap up BIGLY. 

If this company is familiar to you, you may have been burned by the previous attempt at taking this company public with the ticker $ELTZ. Lots of investors got burned by that shell having a criminally negligent CEO (Terrence Tecco), and a lack of DD by PCTI management that was unfamiliar and naive to the fraudulence of OTC world. That merger fell through, and Brian Conway, CEO of The Waypoint Refinery (IR firm) found OZSC to take PCTI public. This ticker (OZSC) is current, established, not in trips, and the CEO was replaced by Brian Conway, who is handling the IR for PCTI. There are plans in the future to eventually uplist, and Conway's eyes are on NASDAQ. To attract the kind of high-tier investors of whom PCTI is worthy, this is a must. 

PCTI operates in the multi-billion dollar power electronics industry and designs and manufactures leading edge power electronic equipment for use in power conversion. PCTI serves clients in several industries including telecommunications, military, transportation, renewable energy and aerospace. PCTI‚Äôs clients include Fortune 500 companies and government organizations such as the US Military, US Airforce, US Navy and NASA. The global power electronics market size in 2017 was valued at $36 Billion and is expected to reach $51 Billion by 2023 according to MarketsandMarketsTM.

PCTI is also entering the Utility Scale Energy Storage industry. PCTI is well positioned to capitalize on the industry‚Äôs explosive growth by leveraging its expertise and market reputation. The Utility Scale Energy Storage industry is expected to grow tenfold by 2024 to reach $74 Billion according to Wood McKenzie Power &amp; Renewable.

This is not a sexy stock. But it's the real deal. It's a growing company, with 28 yrs experience, military clients, in an exploding industry, and it's going for pennies. All recommendations are in my opinion. But don't miss this one. 

P.S: I don't do this. I'm not the kind of guy to pump stocks on message boards and social media. This is my first time actually posting any DD I have done, however if I'm correct, this stock is going to make a lot of wealthy people.

I remember reading something about NMHLY and decided to dump my savings on it (I know, I know.) I was going to get 900 shares at $0.70 (limit order) because I felt it was going to spike soon. When I sent my order the stock jumped down to $0.07 for a split second then jumped right back up. The jump was a little surprising at first but then I noticed my order had filled at $0.70 and I damn near shat myself. Being the great trader that I am I held for as long as I could and sold at $1.30.
Long story short I make $1k on my first penny stocks trade. I know trading stocks isn't that lucrative and was wondering how much profit do y'all average a day and/or week?

Best of luck to all.",2020-04-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9wwcl/beginners_luck/

&amp;#x200B;

 INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO) and GeneOne Life Science (KSE:011000) today announced interim data through week 16 from a Phase 1/2a trial of DNA vaccine INO-4700 (also called GLS-5300) for MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg of INO-4700, a DNA vaccine that targets the MERS-CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein, delivered with intradermal CELLECTRA¬Æ device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events (SAEs). The researchers at the Wistar Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) collaborated on this study with funding from IVI. These results were selected for an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy (ASGCT) Conference to be held virtually from May 12-15, 2020.
