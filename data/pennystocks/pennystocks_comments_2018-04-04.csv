It is possible that the FDA wants more data, and we are committed to providing that” and everybody freaked out and said “OH SHIT FDA *STILL* NEEDS MORE DATA??? Time to sell”.

12,Luffykyle,dwruhc4,/r/pennystocks/comments/89ljbi/akers_bioscience/dwruhc4/,1,Well it depends on how rich you are and how confident you are in the stock. Personally I have 4000 share of AKER and I spent a total of $1000 on it. But I work minimum wage and have less than $3000 in my actual bank account.  So if you’re in a similar position as me I wouldn’t quite recommend going all in like I did (I got a bit carried away when I discovered this stock in January).

This stock will go to 4 might take some months have to have patience dont even pay attention to dips it was up to .91 a week ago been watching since .15 i panicked once and sold bit back in its a money maker. Once i really researched hard im more than confident cant lose. They have good management.  The reason stock dropped so low was owner sold or used shares to get money to pay off debt and upgrade investors didnt want to wait fir stock price to rise back.

You missed the boat when ether was $3 that was time to buy 30k and when it got close to $900 cash out. Its been steadily falling since. Bitcoin all of them. All nation states have crypto America is called dollar. You transfer money or numbers all the time. Call it what you want it was a bunch of people using crypto to fund other things and if you didnt invest soon enough you lost if didnt get out before it dropped below entry .If tou understand pyramid scheme that is what cryto is all day long it will be alot od losers when all is said and done.  But try your hand.  I started ro buy a bunch od ether but my con-science got better of me . I believe in Karma ,2018-04-04
