I promise I am not humble bragging or attempting to pump and dump this stock. I am genuinely curious what this community thinks of ICON.

I will set a stop loss at $.12 but I really think this stock could get close to a dollar a share at the end of the month with a good quarterly announcement, based on previous analysis.
