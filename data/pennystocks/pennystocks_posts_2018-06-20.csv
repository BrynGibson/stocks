I suppose they could issue more shares since they have a float of 3.2 million shares but even then that doesn't seem like it'll be enough.

Certification Represents BlackRidge Technology's First Cyber Defense Product Approval for use Within Federal Agency Infrastructures

PR Newswire

RENO, Nev., June 20, 2018

RENO, Nev., June 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackRidge Technology International, Inc. (OTCQB: BRTI), a leading provider of next generation cyber defense solutions, announced that its BlackRidge Transport Access Control products have been certified for addition to the Department of Defense Information Network Approved Products List (DoDIN APL). This approval allows the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) both domestic and abroad to purchase and operate BlackRidge products within DoD networks.

The DoDIN APL is administered by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and includes only those products certified for use with DoD agencies' technology infrastructure. This designation identifies products that have completed interoperability and cyber security certification via a rigorous testing process conducted by the DoD.  BlackRidge previously received the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) validation certificate #3151 for the cryptographic module in its products.

""Government agencies are under relentless cyber-attacks and they need to move away from legacy architectures to the new and resilient approach to cyber defense that BlackRidge Technology provides,"" said Robert Lentz, BlackRidge director and former DoD CISO. ""Congratulations to the team at BlackRidge for achieving this huge milestone of DoDIN APL certification, that enables the DoD and other global defense organizations to move forward with purchasing BlackRidge products.""

""The successful completion of the rigorous certification process required for inclusion on the DoD Approved Products List is a major accomplishment for BlackRidge that accelerates our ability to deliver innovative cyber defense solutions to the federal sector,"" said Bob Graham, CEO of BlackRidge Technology. ""This achievement provides BlackRidge's commercial, federal and defense clients worldwide with high confidence in BlackRidge as a trusted solution provider that closes critical network security gaps and prevents today's cyber-attacks.""

BlackRidge develops, markets and supports a family of products that provide next generation cyber security solutions for protecting enterprise and government networks, systems and cloud services. BlackRidge's patented First Packet Authentication™ technology was developed for the military to cloak and protect servers and segment networks. Cyber-attacks and insider threats are stopped dead in their tracks by preventing unauthorized users and attackers from performing reconnaissance of network and cloud resources, and by denying them the ability to communicate anonymously.
