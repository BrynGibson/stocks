LAS VEGAS, Jan. 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dakshidin Corporation is pleased to announce that Whitechapel Holdings (WCH), Inc‚Äôs current CEO Christopher (Chris) Haigh has assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Dakshidin Corporation (the Company) and will also join the board of directors.  


Christopher Haigh is a recognized leader in the growth sector of electronic transactions and services. Chris brings international leadership expertise in sales, marketing and technology innovation to Dakshidin. As the President and CEO of Kingsmead Group, a consulting services company that specialises in financial services Chris was initially introduced to the cannabis industry about four years ago as a result of the intrinsic finance and banking issues the industry is still plagued with due to ongoing Federal prohibition. He recognized an early stage opportunity to provide a wide range of ancillary skills and services that formerly no one would attach their reputations to because of the stigma involved. After gaining additional understanding and further exposure to the industry he then recognized a potentially huge underserved market for organic health and wellness CBD products that would cater to the senior demographic.

Mr. Haigh commented: ‚ÄúAs soon as the company is current\* with all of it‚Äôs filings, which will result in the removal of the stop sign, we will apply for a name change. I am truly excited for the additional opportunities that a public parent company provides and we will work extremely hard to reward our current and new shareholders alike.‚Äù  


\*Note: The company is in the process of getting current with all filings and will use the newly created Twitter account to inform everyone as steps are completed as well as corporate updates in between news releases.

Additionally, the company is in the process of obtaining director and officer liability insurance which will allow it to bring on to the board individuals that can help increase the profile of the company as it works to implement its business strategy. The company also confirmed once again that it has no plans to alter the share structure (no roll back), but will instead work towards increasing shareholder value.  


Whitechapel is working on several marketing and joint venture opportunities and will keep shareholders updated.

About Dakshidin Corporation (DKSC)

1. Cannabis prohibition is approaching its inevitable end,

So recently Starbreeze went through a pretty bad controversy. And some bad news for there VR team.
And the company almost collapsed.

They are currently losing money, but they have quite a lot of money built up.

So the stock went from about 20kr(Swedish currency) per share to 1kr

*So here is what I think the future holds*

But I believe there is a bright future for this company, they have some solid game IPs that could make some real money in the future. If they play there cards right.

The studio is well established and have some real talented people working there. So it's a good company.

I do believe there stock will rise 2020 when payday 3 has it's planed release. The prequal, payday 2 was one of the absolute best selling game ever.

I am far from an expert, so what are your guys opinion on this.

HICKSVILLE, NY, Jan. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Canbiola, Inc. (OTCQB: CANB) has purchased Pure Health Products LLC and is launching Pure Leaf Oil as its consumer brand.¬†  


Due to strong product demand,¬†[Canbiola](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_ExYJCgHNqBN9CuLmVaNctxGy598pblop9XZSwobViYlc35EYRJGIH6wekywjcIK4JXWt3u89NOTmWRMOg0EnA==)¬†is on the path toward significant revenue growth in additional segments of the CBD industry.¬† While the Canbiola brand is synonymous with Medical Offices and our Doctor affiliate program, the company has launched¬†[Pure Leaf Oil](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=THTPdLRQl5HQgn3TPXO2lhlLZPVrXlyKQfvPKC0u9dOSql176Y7HyeWFuuPaV8ZXVbFEnkTDlbQenN61pNsTMw==)¬†targeting retail markets including c-stores, bodegas, and yes, even donut stores and bakeries through its network of distributors. Pure Leaf Oil is also expected to be sold through various leading online e-commerce platforms at very aggressive prices.

[Canbiola, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_ExYJCgHNqBN9CuLmVaNcqNgWd37c3gcTiNv0vV2p7v8TACufHxQAv2nB4AWwDlWU3jV058H2swf5-zfzaCwdQeYQnvQJqm8on01IeyAEWI=). has recently completed the acquisition of Pure Health Products LLC including the laboratory and production facility located outside Seattle Washington.¬† The facility is a full-on development laboratory and a fully integrated production facility whereby all formulations, processes, and materials are vertically integrated in the production process.¬† There are no third-party vendors and the company controls the process at each step of processing to insure 100% quality control and product purity.¬† Additionally, all the automated processing and packaging equipment are wholly owned, and the company has no debt.
