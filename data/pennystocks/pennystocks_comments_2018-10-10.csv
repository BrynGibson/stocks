Hey guys here a DD package I‚Äôm working on: 


I took a starter in RCGP on the pull back. 284K float cannabis play. Here are some things I found. The new officers of the company and their backgrounds and how much money they‚Äôve made are what really grabbed my attention on this 



https://twitter.com/silverlakes123/status/1047612545882836992?s=21 

https://twitter.com/silverlakes123/status/1047612753161195520?s=21 

On top of all of this, I emailed the CEO Ray Grimm of https://newyounow.com and it is confirmed through him that they are taking ownership of RCGP and there will be filings of ownership change on October 15th...this might turn into a huge merger play guys 

Look at Ray Grimm‚Äôs success: http://www.raygrimmjr.com 

The email I received: https://ibb.co/mM0f4K 



UPDATE OCTOBER 6TH:
RCGP Filings came out AH yesterday confirming a merger, Guys I‚Äôm doing more digging into the new CEO of $RCGP that CBD naturals is merging into and I‚Äôm starting to find some interesting things. Grimm was ceo of Laguna Blends, He orchestrated the RM into isodiol, Found a pr from isodiol that says that CBD naturals is a sister company. Helped them develop their water line. Have to ask Grimm. But after he stepped down as ceo there, it said he was staying on as an advisor. 

Sister company news: https://isodiol.com/isodiol-news/cbd-water-offering/

To the moon baby!! Bought in at $3.86 yesterday. Hoping to at least double. Holding this one long term for now until convinced otherwise. ",2018-10-10

169,jgoldston_0,e7rbqye,/r/pennystocks/comments/9n2zus/acrx_fda_approval_decision_on_october_12th/e7rbqye/,1,"I think it has plenty of potential leading up to (and following) that Nov 3rd date... But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at some pretty sizable volatility.

The finish line isn‚Äôt really in sight for ACRX.  The drug approval recommendation and, what should be, final approval is great... But now they have to fund manufacturing, marketing and distribution to eventually realize gains.  

Could be an offering on the way.  Could be a buyout.  One would cut the share price in half (at least for the short term) and the other would send it soaring.  And, of course, there‚Äôs a ton of other scenarios regarding funding moving forward that could play out.

I‚Äôm letting my remaining 1000 shares ride.  The day the price crosses $10 I‚Äôll evaluate a plan for exit.  Until that day, should it ever come, I‚Äôll just let this story unfold how it will.",2018-10-10

Interesting to consider, $ACAD is a very similar stock.  They had an fda approval on a prescription drug and carried twice as many shares as ACRX.  They reached a 52-week high of $38 before settling in the $20s.

Not saying it will happen... but it could.",2018-10-10

Are there any plans to get on a stock exchange? (Canadian securities possibly). I'm looking for more that I can buy in my TFSA and it needs to be listed.

On that note if you're aware of any other CBD product makers that are listed I'd appreciate it. I found NU mentored here, which is pretty cool stuff too if you want to check it out.",2018-10-10
