But yes, sooner or later they will let the SP run. Because this will benefit them as well. But should still be careful because a lot of traders are impatient. They see a stock go down and they start dumping everything, or stop losses get hit and it gets pushed all the way down, hitting more weak hands and SP‚Äôs. Basically a spiral downwards.

I play this game the same way I do Vegas.  How does Vegas make bank? It's because they know that people won't stop till everything is gone.  People can't quit while they are ahead.


 I use the ""left pocket - right pocket"" rule.   It goes like this...

Up in the hotel room put $X into your left pocket.  Go down to the casino.  Play a game, cash out, put it all in your right pocket.  NEVER touch anything in your right pocket.  When you get to a set amount in your right pocket, give it to the wife. She's not allowed to give it back.  If the amount in the right pocket and the amount in the wife's purse is equal to or greater than the starting amount, take it back up to the room.

NEVER PLAY ON THE HOUSE'S MONEY.  Example: put $1 into a slot machine. Play $1 worth of plays. Cash out. Don't keep hitting that damn button till it says 0 credits.",2020-05-07

Low average volume and share price also puts it at a good position of a future pump and dump.

At the end of yesterday, IZEA looked like it was going to be netting me 2500 dollars (for someone who works for 15 dollars an hour...yeesh!) but at the beginning of today, it dropped to something like 1000, so I took it and ran.   Funny thing, though, I honestly think I got out a week too early. We'll see I guess.  I was also poised on the MVIS AH news -- I was super lucky with MVIS to buy at like 1.15 and just barely get out at 1.25 as it was diving two days ago. 


I've started getting a little paranoid about the pump and dumping -- it's here to make me money, we all have to acknowledge it goes on and try to take advantage of it early and sell out early as well.  

One thing I've started doing is checking out the ""people also bought"" section on these recommendations we're getting, looking for other picks (such as VXRT) that have not been mentioned (yet) on this sub.  

I'm in both of those now, both companies have 180m-ish market cap, both seem to be poised for the new world. 

We'll see though.

**From what I see,** reading the proverbial ""tea leaves"", CEO Sharma may leverage \[the liquidity provided by 50 million shares\] to speed-up the M&amp;A process. And at the same time take 10 million shares to raise $30 million or so; and persuade us (the investor community) to NOT sell the LiDAR product vertical... and fund the R&amp;D for the next two years to keep developing this high profile, high value, high margin LiDAR product vertical that serves the Trillion Dollar TaaS \[Transportation as a Service\] business revolution.

**Personally,** I highly recommend CEO Sharma did that; and hope we (the investor community) supports the MicroVision management in their ""LiDAR as a product"" business model in the revolutionary TaaS marketplace.

**TaaS is over a Trillion Dollar automotive marketplace...** and it will be hugely profitable selling \[high value, high margin\] LiDAR for collision avoidance in new \[75 million cars per year\] and existing \[1.4 billion cars on the road\] and millions of Electric Autonomous Vehicles for the TaaS business marketplace revolution.

**Sales of MicroVision LiDAR will be huge and stupendously profitable**... based on its superb size, weight, power, functionality, day-light resolution and unmatched spec that is unique to LBS based 3-D scanning.

**What is TaaS:**

TaaS... Transportation as a Service is the latest technology revolution that will dramatically change the way we live, work and travel... it will forever change our lives..

I have been at the cusp of every single technological and business revolution over the past 50 years... but TaaS is the biggest with massive global impact that will change every aspect of 7 billion our lives on planet Earth.

**For me, it all started with:**

1. Nuclear Power in the late 60s... retired as Chief Engineer EI&amp;C in 1980.
2. Personal Computers in the late 70s... built a $60 million revenue computer company by 1995.
3. Internet in the late 80s... made over 1,000% profit with companies like Intel.
4. World Wide Web and Mobile in late 90s... missed the early days.
5. Online and Micro Payment networks in year 2000... launched [www.LeRumba.com](http://www.lerumba.com/)
6. Social Media in the 2000... missed the early days.
7. TaaS in the year 2019. Invested heavily, and continue to do so, in MicroVision stock (NASDAQ: MVIS)... all the way from $6 a few years ago... to $0.20 few months ago... and now to the present day.

Imagine a world with no service stations and no parking lots. Where houses or apartment blocks won‚Äôt require garages or parking bays. Where there are no speeding tickets or parking infringements, and the promise of no road fatalities. Where private commuters travel long distances to work while catching up on the latest news, work or catch-up on some extra sleep while traveling.

The advent of fully autonomous personal transport will likely be the most significant technological advance of the 21st century. Electric Vehicles and Driver-less vehicles will change the way everyone across the world lives, works and travels.

How autonomous transport systems will function will stretch the human imagination. ‚ÄúThe day fully autonomous vehicles hit our streets is the day cars are not cars anymore. They can be anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe primary function of transportation disappears to give rise to other functions. It could be an extension of our homes or our offices or our local cafe.‚Äù

The concept of car ownership itself is under threat in a world dominated by autonomous vehicles. The line separating public and private transport will blur. You will see personal mobility go down the same route as other industries, from music, to news, by moving to a subscription model...

**‚ÄúTransport as a Service‚Äù (TaaS)**

Its the combination of two revolutionary technologies \[ Electric Vehicle and Autonomous Vehicle\] and a breakthrough business model \[Waymo, Uber, Lyft and dozens of others\].

Current car ownership model cost... $0.70 per mile.Future TaaS subscription model... $0.10 per mile

Electric Vehicle Maintenance: Every 100,000 miles

Electric Vehicle Life Span: !,000,000 miles

Moving Parts in a Combustion Engine Car: 2,200

Moving Parts in a Electric Vehicle: 20

The TaaS era is imminent. All cars sold by 2025 will be electric. By then, electric vehicles will be up to 10 times cheaper to operate and maintain than those with internal combustion engines powered by fossil fuels, making them ideal for fleet buyers... offering TaaS (Transportation as a Service) subscription.

**MicroVision: Highly Recommended TaaS Stock...**

However, I will say that today's action was weird. Really weird.  It made sense that folks were skittish after yesterday. Hell, the whole market was skittish to begin with in general so that doesn't help.  But the stock behaved very oddly with lots of sideways moves locked in between several targets.

But for those of us looking at level 2 data it was even odder.  Buy and sell orders can be viewed (but not the individuals). All day long there were plays where 2 sides would wall. You would have several large order buyers interested 1-5 cents below the price, and several large order sellers interested 1-5 cents above the price. The stock would go up, sell-off, go down, buy, go back up, sell.  Now this by itself isn't insanely odd because walls are normal and so is oscillation in the stock. But what was weird was the size of these orders. Massive orders of at least 10k, often 25k, sometimes higher. And it seemed like the same buyers were playing both sides. Plus the tight windows the orders were in and the speed of the bounce.

Especially interesting was the MASSIVE wall at $1. Clearly some large buyers did not want the stock to drop below $1 if possible. And it slowly trickled down like this today with walls adjusting down until it got into the $1-$1.10 range in after-hours and then just cycled.

Some big players are playing this stock. For what reason I don't know but generally if they were just here to make money they would have taken their money and let the stock crash and do whatever.  That has yet to happen.

Again, not saying you are right, but the behavior here seems abnormal which suggests someone knows something or has a particular plan (even if it's just an attempt to maintain the stock above $1).",2020-05-07

As an OTC stock, it would not have been available on RH even before the suspension and certainly not now.

The good news for bagholders is that:

1.  The CEO has switched to CFO and gotten a board together suggesting he's trying to take the company in a more reputable and solid direction and perhaps is prepping for getting bigger

2. SEC has yet to take any further action suggesting the suspension was just PR based (as suspected) and there is nothing else wrong with the company apart from being a bit reckless with early PR.

3. They still have 2 tests undergoing FDA approval and have been working on additional testing of the tests with consistent communication with the FDA.

4. They have unsponsored (as in they were reached out to, they didn't go fishing) PR this week from CBS relating to their possible COVID-19 test that's waiting on FDA approval.

5. All the brokers that have been asked or made statements on the matter say they will allow DECN to continue trading as normal (generally from what I understand, when an OTC stock is suspended and moved to the grey market, may brokers would not allow trading on it afterward). So you WILL be able to trade it.

As for what it will do. Who knows. I am fairly certain it will crash initially, but it's very possible it bounces back and if a test from them gets FDA approval it will skyrocket. I will say FDA approval is likely still a bit away (if it even happens), but we will see.",2020-05-07

After reviewing their SEC filings it seems that whoever is buying in large quantities is doing so, at least in part, to keep the stock afloat but not too far above that $1 line.  Is it possible that the pump and rumors were simply a means of getting the share price above $1 to avoid delisting?

I realized they shut him down over saying the test takes  15 seconds,  get test results in as little as 15 seconds is more accurate. chance at a penny stock that could go to $200,000,000 or higher in revenue is worth a few bucks a share. Genviro is supposedly quicker and more accurate. His Korean supplier needed blood samples from 10 cases that have covid and 10 that don‚Äôt.

I don't necessarily blame you, but if you look at their track record they usually produce serious runners. The problem that a lot of people have is that they manipulate the stock and keep it super low, but what everyone fails to disclose is that they only keep the stock prices down UNTIL they get FDA approval or positive pre-clinical trials. As soon as they get an FDA approved drug, they let that bitch runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. It's a waiting game for them. AYTU will be no different. If this Healight gets FDA approval, they gunna let it rip. KTOV will not be any different.

If the goal was solely to regain compliance it would be better and easier to just keep FOMO going instead of letting someone stop raid and then crash and accumulate.

So say you have $10k, you can trade in and out of the same stock ten times in a day. Just remember the sell won't settle for two days. So that money can't be used until it's settled.

The main benefit of this is so you don't feel like you have to stay trapped in a stock overnight. Margin eliminates that funds settled limitation, but to me a small account should either be long term or day/swing trading... If the latter, then you shouldn't be risking so much that you run out of available funds...

Volume today was less than a third compared to yesterday's volume, whales cashed out and went for the next prey leaving all the bagholders behind and the stock's price bleeding. It will keep slowly dipping tomorrow throughout the day and close red. We may see a major, violent dip depending on how fast and wide the panic spreads. If microsoft/other major company are not mentioned or the rumors are denied, after market will dip to $0.30, possibly even lower. Prepare to wake up to a massive red dildo Friday.

Now... Is it ((((possible)))) that these rumors are true? Im not going to lie, this is a crazy fucking world so yes. But this is a one in a million chance, and one that's definitely not worth risking all my money for lol. Let's be honest, we have no evidence whatsoever. It's just gossiping after gossiping. Rumors after rumors. The stock has no support, it's literally just hanging on thin air with a bunch of people desperately blowing on it to keep it from crashing.

If microsoft is truly buying the company, we are extremely early and will be able to cash out mad profits regardless. Very, very few people know about this nationwide.

I am extremely bearish for tomorrow and upcoming weeks. 90% puts and carrying some hedge just in the one in bajirillion chance this crazy MSFT shenanigans is true.

By the way, do you really think people would orchestrate this massive scheme knowing well this stock would gain, possibly, nationwide attention? It would be like asking for SEC's attention. I think it is much more likely that we are being targeted by a group of clever shills and P&amp;Ders making all these rumors about small companies being bought by major companies and profiting from it.

Short is to borrow a stock from their brokerage company at a certain price. When they wish to cash out they must buy the stock and return it to their brokerage. If the price goes up one losses money if the price goes down one makes money 
A short squeeze is when all the shorts shit their pants cause a stock is due to rise so they need to buy back the borrowed stock to return to the brokerage company thus creating a false rise in the stock. With the cbs news this is gonna be insane. I started trading penny stocks cause of decn. I did the dd. Read the sec halt reports. Saw the 3 big pharmaceutical companies that have a similar test all approved. DECN has a supplier because of his diabetes tests and it has been speculated he can make tests quicker which means back to work sooner. He will probably get approval. But he will have to sell them. If he gets contracts to sell at Costco Walmart or in Europe he will have a viable company. He needs HRs/employees, software that can handle the orders, and a board or it will all fail. All odds are against him but his company at this point is valued higher Based on the perceived value/potential. If this stock doesn‚Äôt rise it will be major.

I am gonna be honest, Angela, a lot of people in this subreddit are *NOT business or big money savvy*. Until I was exposed to 1) being responsible for the function, operation and success of a multi-million dollar a day business and 2) around people with ASTRONOMICAL, INCOMPREHENSIBLE AMOUNTS of POWER AND MONEY (whom I was fortunate to spent real time interacting with them in significant ways), I would have never understood / comprehended their way of thinking. 

You made a good call and you have a good head on your shoulders. Thanks!

My next play is to wait until I see a standard hold of the stock over the dollar for the full ten days. 

**IF** and only **IF** that happens, that's absolute, concrete proof that this is the ground floor of a long term rocket to a whole new level. I will be stopping everything else, watching how this unfolds and climb aboard to go along. 

Let's hope this happens. Let me know what your play on this will be. 

Lastly, this wasn't ""Tin Foil Hat"" thinking, you looked at it in business mindset and came to the best solution for what was best for the company. if that's crazy, then that's crazy smart and valuable for your long term success. When you figure something like this out, I hope you acted on it to your benefit **FIRST**, then tell others after your play.

It's a comparison of mentality, not two items (i.e. stocks &amp; lottery tickets). 

In general, poor people buy lots of lottery tickets because they actually think they're going to win. This financially hurts them because the end up spending more money than they can afford on the hope that they'll make more money than they have. On the flip side, rich people generally want to stay rich so they will invest in the stock market knowing there is a potential they can lose it all so *most* only risk what they can afford to lose.

Ask yourself, if a poor person amasses a small fortune of $25k, would you want them to spend it all on lottery tickets?",2020-05-07

This worked out **EXACTLY** as planned and as you predicted. I was able to reduce a HUGE loss to only $30+ in mere seconds and used only one Day Trade on my RH account to do it.

I am gonna be honest, Angela, a lot of people in this subreddit are *NOT business or big money savvy*. Until I was exposed to 1) being responsible for the function, operation and success of a multi-million dollar a day business and 2) around people with ASTRONOMICAL, INCOMPREHENSIBLE AMOUNTS of POWER AND MONEY (whom I was fortunate to spent real time interacting with them in significant ways), I would have never understood / comprehended their way of thinking.

You made a good call and you have a good head on your shoulders. Thanks!

My next play is to wait until I see a standard hold of the stock over the dollar for the full ten days.

**IF** and only **IF** that happens, that's absolute, concrete proof that this is the ground floor of a long term rocket to a whole new level. I will be stopping everything else, watching how this unfolds and climb aboard to go along.

Let's hope this happens. Let me know what your play on this will be.

Lastly, this wasn't ""Tin Foil Hat"" thinking, you looked at it in business mindset and came to the best solution for what was best for the company. if that's crazy, then that's crazy smart and valuable for your long term success. When you figure something like this out, I hope you acted on it to your benefit **FIRST**, then tell others after your play.

Whenever MVIS stock is lower than $1 by end of day, that's the time to lower your cost average. It's gonna cost your, but if you know that the close of the MVIS stock will be over $1 then you know what will drive your loss to a reasonably flat amount. If you were left holding the bag on MVIS, lower your costs, sell near close then move on. 

If you're looking to profit off of swing trade skims, then if the stock dips anywhere in below a set amount, then you know you will be profitable by end of week next Friday.

Listen, this may sound shitty but this big money whale in the room already took the 700k plunge drinking up all the very best profits on 5/5, then skimmed every small investor to the bone on 5/6. IF YOU HAVE NERVES OF STEEL you MIGHT make a profit by skimming the whale. Remember, they can scare the HELL out of you without a losing any real profits in the short or long term. The likelyhood is that if you try to skim MVIS, the person's coin you'll be taking is someone very much like yourself. This is all thought out, it's not nearly their first time and they will succeed regardless of they have to tank MVIS to do it.

Remember, MVIS has to do 10 days before early - mid June (I think, don't quote me) so they have plenty of time to sink your battleship and laugh about it. 

To me the best play is when I KNOW that the 10 day run to stay over the $1 mark is over and then get it, even if it cost me plenty, because the MVIS business model and future is good and has a lot of future potential in the long term.

Are you going to also make the argument that poor people are never going to be able to participate in the activity of driving a brand new car? What's the point here? There are plenty of restrictions in life ""because of economic status."" If a poor person wants a new car, but has bad (or no) credit, should the dealer just give it to them anyway?

&gt;I started my IRA with 500 bucks to give it a try. I cannot buy and sell $250 of any stock in one day.

I am too new to stocks to know what the rule requirements are regarding an IRA account, but I would imagine they are different than a regular trading account. That's something I would look into if I had an IRA.

&gt;It's doing nothing to protect me.

It's not just about protecting you but also to protect the broker who is quoting the stock and the average poor person who may not be as wise when it comes to making decisions within the stock market.

To end, I don't want you to think that I don't understand your point. I, too, wish that I could take the money in my account and make unlimited day trades, but I do not have $25k in my account. While I could sit and bicker about the rules, I'm spending my time studying and learning so that I can get my portfolio up to $25k.

And *really*, I think this all comes down to one question‚Äîis the PDT rule fair?

You may not be inclined to think so, and you may be right, but I'd much rather fight the battle of obtaining $25k than the rule that requires I have it.

EDIT: Also, in case you're looking for a cheat code... the PDT rule only applies to trading accounts within the U.S. If you were so inclined, you could easily open up an account with a reputable dealer *outside the U.S.* and make as many trades with as little or as much money as you want in a day.",2020-05-07

Here they talk about the drug impact, how it works, how it got FDA marketing approval in the US as well. So what does the drug treat? Hypertension (High blood pressure) and Osteoporotic pain (Bones hurt for this or that reason). Hypertension is found in almost HALF of the adult population in the US (https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm) and osteoporosis effects almost 10 million people in the US with an extra 44 million at extra risk (https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm).

Put in the fact that this drug has shown promising results with BOTH illnesses, AND is set for marking/launch mid May (next week) you should expect a little bit of a boom. But we also see shabby has a good amount of stock in KTOV as well, and quite a bit of their companies have BOOMED right after purchase from shabby (not gonna link those because lazy). So what I personally see as a professional retard, is a slow increase until we FUCKING BLAST OFFüöÄüöÄ

Hey guys, may have found an interesting/profitable play.

I'm looking at TLSS for end of week, early next.

-2020 First-quarter revenues were 50% higher than 2019 (https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/transportation-and-logistics-systems-inc-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2020-revenues-increased-49-over-same-period-in-2019-2020-04-28-8197959?mod=mw_quote_news).

-They recently rebalanced a large amount of bad debt (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005436/0/en/TLSS-Announces-1-7-Million-in-Debt-Settlement-Agreements.html).

-They started working with an experienced consultant on 3/10 who has a vested interest in seeing the stock price increase (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/10/1997978/0/en/TLSS-Engages-Sebastian-Giordano-as-Turnaround-and-Restructuring-Consultant.html).

-They started working with an investor relations/digital strategies firm on 3/3 (pumpers) (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994249/0/en/TLSS-Selects-PCG-Advisory-for-Investor-Relations-and-Strategic-Communications.html).

On 4/22, they announced that they had received a PPP loan totaling 3 million dollars. (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14094973&amp;type=8)

This is nuts, they rebalanced/renegotiated debt lower. Then, immediately after, they got a 3 million dollar loan which they'll most likely not have to pay back due to the PPP forgiveness program. Huge for their books.

This stock was at ~$3 in February and has made two runups near .10 in the past 20 days.

Furthermore, there were two somewhat large positions bought yesterday (5/6) for 4 million shares (~$118,000) and 2.4 million shares (~$70,768). Both positions were executed at .029487. You can see for yourself here: https://imgur.com/a/2lDVFRt Today (5/7), there was another 4 million shares bought at .027855 ($111,420). See here: https://imgur.com/a/Z63qvUB

So, they recently:

-Rebalanced their debt

-Received 3 million dollars from PPP loan (free money) to expand and maintain operations

-Covid surely added a boost with packages/orders and Amazon was looking for all the help they could get = positive outlook towards/after earnings.

-The stock has made two runs up near .10 in the past 20 days and there are several somewhat large buyers having enough confidence to invest at ~.03 a share.

-Another random confirmation (http://www.pennystockdream.com/blog/tlss-closed-up-32069-after-announcing-first-quarter-revenue-of-86-million)

""The fact that any company reporting such massive sales numbers while simultaneously sitting at less than a quarter million market cap is a bit astounding but it becomes even more unbelievable when taking into account that TLSS is fully audited and SEC reporting, as opposed to opting for the alternative reporting standard. The fact that the company has opened its books to scrutiny from regulatory agencies makes us far more interested in looking further into this one, because it seems to hold serious potential for future gains.""

-Positive statements from executive team on 4/9 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14067745&amp;type=8)

-Article from May 4th titled ""5 high volume stocks to add to your watch list"" that overviewed MVIS, MARK, IZEA, ZOM, and ... TLSS. But, TLSS hasn't moved much yet because the ""to the moon"" train was focused on the other tickers, as I'm sure you know. ___________________________________________________________________________-

They filed for an extension for their 10-Q on 3/24. It's likely they knew they would apply for the PPP loan and it would drastically change how earnings would turn out if they got it. They did get it. They report earnings next week.

Do your own DD too but this is what I'm coming up with. I'm in for ~115,000 shares at ~ .0295 -.03

I can definitely see the stock moving to .10 and potentially higher off all the good news/hype as people start to hear more.",2020-05-07

**This is nuts, they rebalanced/renegotiated debt lower. Then, immediately after, they got a 3 million dollar loan which they'll most likely not have to pay back due to the PPP forgiveness program. Huge for their books.**

This stock was at ~$3 in February and has made two runups near .10 in the past 20 days.

**Furthermore, there were two somewhat large positions bought yesterday (5/6) for 4 million shares (~$118,000) and 2.4 million shares (~$70,768). Both positions were executed at .029487. You can see for yourself here: https://imgur.com/a/2lDVFRt Today (5/7), there was another 4 million shares bought at .027855 ($111,420). See here: https://imgur.com/a/Z63qvUB**

So, they recently:

-Rebalanced their debt

-Received 3 million dollars from PPP loan (free money) to expand and maintain operations

-Covid surely added a boost with packages/orders and Amazon was looking for all the help they could get = positive outlook towards/after earnings.

-The stock has made two runs up near .10 in the past 20 days and there are several somewhat large buyers having enough confidence to invest at ~.03 a share.

-Another random confirmation (http://www.pennystockdream.com/blog/tlss-closed-up-32069-after-announcing-first-quarter-revenue-of-86-million)

""The fact that any company reporting such massive sales numbers while simultaneously sitting at less than a quarter million market cap is a bit astounding but it becomes even more unbelievable when taking into account that TLSS is fully audited and SEC reporting, as opposed to opting for the alternative reporting standard. The fact that the company has opened its books to scrutiny from regulatory agencies makes us far more interested in looking further into this one, because it seems to hold serious potential for future gains.""

-Positive statements from executive team on 4/9 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14067745&amp;type=8)

-Article from May 4th titled ""5 high volume stocks to add to your watch list"" that overviewed MVIS, MARK, IZEA, ZOM, and ... TLSS. But, TLSS hasn't moved much yet because the ""to the moon"" train was focused on the other tickers, as I'm sure you know. ___________________________________________________________________________-

**They filed for an extension for their 10-Q on 3/24. It's likely they knew they would apply for the PPP loan and it would drastically change how earnings would turn out if they got it. They did get it. They report earnings next week.**

Do your own DD too but this is what I'm coming up with. I'm in for ~115,000 shares at ~ .0295 -.03

I can definitely see the stock moving to .10 and potentially higher off all the good news/hype as people start to hear more.",2020-05-07

The concept of it being more risky only applies if you borrow excess value from the broker. If you only use you funds in a 1:1 ratio, meaning you only borrow an amount equal to or less than the amount you have, i.e. borrow your unsettled funds value to purchase/sell stocks, you'll avoid a GFV while also NOT incuring extra risk. Make sure your broker won't charge you if you're just using it to cover unsettled funds while they settle (fidelity explained to me they do NOT charge you in this case idk if your broker is different). 
The biggest risk is the ability to hop in and out of stocks, so patience. But thats on you.",2020-05-07

Its pretty damn rare for a suspended stock to manage to make its way back from the grey market  to a normal trading platform. 

Between 2010 and 2019, \~3,300 stocks were suspended by the SEC. ¬†

Of those 3,300 stocks that were suspended, less than a dozen have managed to claw their way back to resume normal trading.

The SEC is plenty aware that a suspension is on par with a death sentence.  They do not invoke suspensions on a whim.

You don't get a slip of paper for your time or money that was lost, but you do get a valuable lesson. It's what you choose to do with that lesson that matters. 

I lost about $700 on 1800 shares from 1.57 down to 1.11. Sucks, but I came into this wanting to learn and grow. That financial hit has caused me to do a lot of self reflection and reading of information trying to prevent that same error from happening at such a large scale again. Granted, I came into penny trading knowing I could loose the money I was running with. I'm only about $500 down in my 5k I gave myself to learn and play. I'm not actually doing that bad.

But how you grow from thi sis the most important thing. You can cry into your bags and try to find the next moonshot to make up for it or you can put in the hard daily work taking your 7-30% gains and running. I did it today, I put 200 into CNAT and saw 8% and ran. If I'd waited a few seconds later I'd have lost another 2%. 

Of course, that bought me back only about $20, but it was a prime example of strategy beating prayer here. So you lost today, possibly big. But unless you learn nothing from it, you paid hard for that education, don't piss it away by throwing in the towel.",2020-05-07

Well. You just lost big on MVIS. Oh and don‚Äôt forget the cash you lost yesterday on UAVS. Oh And the week before on XSPA. Oh and TOPS too. You just took a rosebud to your portfolio on the dinkiest of stocks. It adds up. No Lambo for you.

4222,govprop2000,fpsevpe,/r/pennystocks/comments/gf7jez/balls_deep_into_mvis/fpsevpe/,0,I disagree. The rs is likely a tactic that will be used to prevent delisting. The company buying will likely want lowest shares possible before the merger/acq. I think it's a longer term hold this month but don't think the reverse split will actually happen in the end. Companies are on buy mode swallowing smaller businesses for market share and it's only gonna increase until we are out of the pandemic. Mvis will continue to produce their tech and are highly undervalued right now which is a great place for a acq in the economies current situation. Normally I would say they need stronger growth but not with out current situation they need cheap stocks in the $1 range. It will shoot to up but probably should buy more at it's current price Incase you don't hit levels of previous stock buy ins.,2020-05-07

REDMOND, Wash., May 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MicroVision, Inc.(MVIS) , a leader in innovative ultra-miniature projection display and sensing technology, today announced its first quarter 2020 results.


Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $1.5 million, compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2019. MicroVision's(MVIS) net loss for the first quarter of 2020 was $4.9 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million, or $0.08 per share for the first quarter of 2019.

‚ÄúWe are committed to finding strategic alternatives that maximize the value of the Company for our stakeholders.  With the help of our financial advisor, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, we have approached a global list of targeted companies and are diligently exploring all options including the sale of one or more of our module product verticals and related technology or a potential sale of the Company,‚Äù said Sumit Sharma, MicroVision's(MVIS) Chief Executive Officer.

‚ÄúDuring the first quarter we took many steps to manage costs and create a runway that we expect will give us time to complete a strategic transaction.  We transferred responsibility for component production to our April 2017 customer and sold production assets, which lowered our costs and working capital requirements.  In addition, we initiated a 60% reduction to our workforce and curtailed non-essential expenses,‚Äù said Sharma.",2020-05-07

4710,MrRobotTheorist,fpteytl,/r/pennystocks/comments/gfeb72/made_a_table_based_off_a_fellow_redditors_strategy/fpteytl/,1,"So if you decide to sell at a certain price due to uncertainty etc, depending on how much it increased you sell the amount of shares to get your money back.  You‚Äôll have leftover shares that you could consider essentially free.  You‚Äôve lost no money because you‚Äôve already covered any potential loses by selling that amount of shares.

With the left over shares you have a few options.  1.  Sell the remainder for profit.  Leaving no shares left.
2.  Sell a portion of the shares for profit.  And let the rest roll.  You take a smaller profit initially for bigger gains but this move would be more risky.
3.  Sell none.  You can hold as long as you like.  Whenever you decide to sell you‚Äôve gained a profit no matter what, because any potential income after you‚Äôve covered what you spent is profit.  

Although #2 is more risky you‚Äôve covered any potential losses by selling those shares.

In the table when looking at 100.  You bought 100 shares at 0.34.  The stock increased 50%.  So now the price per share is sitting at 0.51.  At 50% you can sell 67 of your shares to cover what you spent.  This would leave you with 33 shares to do what you want.

Come up with an entry point you are comfortable with, pick a profit margin you are expecting based on the DD, and choose and exit point and STICK TO IT. My general rule of thumb is buy in before a 20% increase and sell once i hit 50-60% profit margins. If it goes higher than my exit point, it doesn't really bother me. Profit is profit. A little bit of something is better than a whole lot of nothing. Most people on here *think* they have an exit strategy but then get caught up in the FOMO and end up riding a stock way higher then they should. The #1 rule for ANY trader is: Profits are profits. If you stack up 5 stocks with 20% increase each in one week, that is still 100% gains. You don't need to commit and ride one stock and risk all your money.

It should not go below $1.10, considering they had an offering at that recently so they've got a good floor, and a LOT of big names bought in, including perceptive. The offering also gave them the cash on hand that they needed. A lot of targets for it have it at 7-9$.

* FDA approval for marketing a treatment for osteoarthritic pain and hypertension (drug is called Consensi)
   * Will hit market in Q2
   * They partnered with S.Korea, US, and China (huge markets)
* 2 other drugs are in the pre-clinical and Phase I clinical trials for cancer drugs
* Debt/Equity ratio of 2.05, aka lots of cash on hand and not a lot of debt payments
* Avg vol (10 day)/Avg vol (3 month) = 3.8
   * Lots of attention recently
* $10M public offering to purchase 25M shares at a price of $0.40 (expires tomorrow)
   * If closes above $0.40 EOD tomorrow, massive purchase order ""should"" be executed and pump the price
      * Only risk if this is a shorting style of play
* 17.75% of shares are institutionally owned, lots of big boys believe in it
* Market Cap of $26.8M which will drastically reduce if the public offering is executed
* 52 Week high of $1.12

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I see possibility of a solid investment in the long term, especially given they have a physical drug hitting the market in Q2 with interest from two G7 countries. Not to say South Korea isn't a powerhouse of an economy either. Add into this the low debt, high cash on hand and they are well poised to weather any delay in their other drugs in clinical trials.

Short term pump is possible with the public offering and the increasing volume in the past 10 days.

The way I see it, there is a risk in the short term, however, long term growth seems well for the remainder of 2020.",2020-05-07

5356,OlympusMonsMan,fps5nm4,/r/pennystocks/comments/gf8qai/has_anyone_ever_gone_all_in/fps5nm4/,1,"I'm looking at TLSS for end of week, early next. Might do a DD thread later. 

2020 First-quarter revenues were 50% higher than 2019 (https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/transportation-and-logistics-systems-inc-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2020-revenues-increased-49-over-same-period-in-2019-2020-04-28-8197959?mod=mw_quote_news). 

They recently rebalanced some bad debt (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005436/0/en/TLSS-Announces-1-7-Million-in-Debt-Settlement-Agreements.html).

They started working with an experienced consultant on 3/10 who has a vested interest in seeing the stock price increase (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/10/1997978/0/en/TLSS-Engages-Sebastian-Giordano-as-Turnaround-and-Restructuring-Consultant.html).

They started working with a investor relations/ digital strategies firm on 3/3 (pumpers) (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994249/0/en/TLSS-Selects-PCG-Advisory-for-Investor-Relations-and-Strategic-Communications.html).

On 4/22, they announced that they had received a PPP loan totaling 3 million dollars. (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14094973&amp;type=8)

This is nuts, they rebalanced/renegotiated debt lower and then immediately after they got a 3 million dollar loan which they will most likely not have to pay back due to the PPP forgiveness program.

This stock was at ~$3 before corona and has made two runups near .10 in the past 20 days.

Furthermore, there were two somewhat large positions bought yesterday for 4 million shares (~$118,000) and 2.95 million shares (~$87,025). Both positions were executed at .29487. You can see for yourself here: https://imgur.com/a/2lDVFRt

So, they recently: 

-Rebalanced their debt

 -Received 3 million dollars from PPP loan (free money) to expand and maintain operations

-Covid surely added a boost with packages/orders and Amazon was looking for all the help they could get = positive outlook towards/after earnings.

-The stock has made two runs up near .10 in the past 20 days and there are somewhat large buyers having enough confidence to invest at ~.03 a share.

-Another random confirmation (http://www.pennystockdream.com/blog/tlss-closed-up-32069-after-announcing-first-quarter-revenue-of-86-million)

""The fact that any company reporting such massive sales numbers while simultaneously sitting at less than a quarter million market cap is a bit astounding but it becomes even more unbelievable when taking into account that TLSS is fully audited and SEC reporting, as opposed to opting for the alternative reporting standard. The fact that the company has opened its books to scrutiny from regulatory agencies makes us far more interested in looking further into this one, because it seems to hold serious potential for future gains.""


-Positive statements from executive team on 4/9 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14067745&amp;type=8)
___________________________________________________________________________-

They filed for an extension for their 10-Q on 3/24. Likely cause they knew they would apply for the PPP loan and it would drastically change how earnings turn out. They report earnings next week.

5621,Chas74124,fpse84o,/r/pennystocks/comments/gf92p7/why_youre_wrong_about_izea/fpse84o/,6,"&gt; People will be working from home, staying home more often, using the internet more, spending more time on social media to get their social fix, and right there with them, whether they know it or not will be **IZEA marketing to them all the things they want**. Along with that, will be big name corporations who need to make money somehow.

How ironic. OPs post screams bought upvotes, bought comments, and general promotion. This will go under the radar, because OP smartly frames it by stating:

&gt;Since UAVS, and following closely MVIS, this sub has become a huge circle jerk of ""THIS STOCK ABOUT TO RUN, GET READY TO P&amp;D!""

Which is exactly what OPs post is intended to do. Get you to buy because he thinks it'll run. This isn't logic. It's gullibility. Some promoters are better than others. OP is just another one who uses nicer language, but has the same overall objective. Get gullible redditors to buy so he can eventually sell.

OP is either some ""wholesome"" 16 year old robinhood user, or he's actually a promoter who's aware of his powers and audience. The ones who'll actually believe that nonsense being his audience.

Some redditors seem to forget that stock trading forums, regardless of whether reddit is ""wholesome and friendly,"" is subjected to the same types of ploys. 

Now the counter argument is OP actually is a 16 year old Robinhood user. I suspect those who believe that may be correct. OP comment only yesterday:

&gt;[Support at .60's, next stop .80. **Could easily see $1 tomorrow.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gek86b/izea_is_a_mover/fpoejr4/?context=3)

Where his replies to those who sell on the way up:

&gt;[Why sell, lol?
At least hold until 14th, imo.](https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gek86b/izea_is_a_mover/fpof39l/?context=3)

Who's advice, only yesterday, was it's time to sell at .60. Today it dropped to .45:

&gt;(YESTERDAY)Uh, from my understanding if it's at .74, you can set a **stop loss for .64 and if it hits .64 it will sell**. With stop loss you set a trigger sell price(.64) and a limit sell price(.60), so that way it hits .64 and will sell for a minimum of .60.

and 

&gt;[**Just sell IZEA at .60 if it drops below it lol. I'm all in at .70**](https://i.imgur.com/An1eJGg.png)

It's down 15% since that post. Since he seems to be wildly all over the place with his predictions, perhaps he's not the best source of promotion. Again not logic. OP seems to be commenting never ending rationalizations about his entry. This is bagholder territory. Robinhood user wouldn't surprise anyone.


Here's logic: OP is likely in a bad position, and wants other gullible idiots be in the same. Too bad he's caught on the back side of the pump.",2020-05-07

\-2020 First-quarter revenues were 50% higher than 2019 ([https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/transportation-and-logistics-systems-inc-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2020-revenues-increased-49-over-same-period-in-2019-2020-04-28-8197959?mod=mw\_quote\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/transportation-and-logistics-systems-inc-announces-preliminary-first-quarter-2020-revenues-increased-49-over-same-period-in-2019-2020-04-28-8197959?mod=mw_quote_news)).

\-They recently rebalanced a large amount of bad debt ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005436/0/en/TLSS-Announces-1-7-Million-in-Debt-Settlement-Agreements.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/24/2005436/0/en/TLSS-Announces-1-7-Million-in-Debt-Settlement-Agreements.html)).

\-They started working with an experienced consultant on 3/10 who has a vested interest in seeing the stock price increase ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/10/1997978/0/en/TLSS-Engages-Sebastian-Giordano-as-Turnaround-and-Restructuring-Consultant.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/10/1997978/0/en/TLSS-Engages-Sebastian-Giordano-as-Turnaround-and-Restructuring-Consultant.html)).

\-They started working with an investor relations/digital strategies firm on 3/3 (pumpers) ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994249/0/en/TLSS-Selects-PCG-Advisory-for-Investor-Relations-and-Strategic-Communications.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/03/1994249/0/en/TLSS-Selects-PCG-Advisory-for-Investor-Relations-and-Strategic-Communications.html)).

**On 4/22, they announced that they had received a PPP loan totaling 3 million dollars. (**[**https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14094973&amp;type=8**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14094973&amp;type=8)**)**

**This is nuts, they rebalanced/renegotiated debt lower. Then, immediately after, they got a 3 million dollar loan which they'll most likely not have to pay back due to the PPP forgiveness program. Huge for their books.**

This stock was at \~$3 in February and has made two runups near .10 in the past 20 days.

**Furthermore, there were two somewhat large positions bought yesterday (5/6) for 4 million shares (\~$118,000) and 2.4 million shares (\~$70,768). Both positions were executed at .029487. You can see for yourself here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/2lDVFRt**](https://imgur.com/a/2lDVFRt) **Today (5/7), there was another 4 million shares bought at .027855 ($111,420). See here:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Z63qvUB**](https://imgur.com/a/Z63qvUB)

So, they recently:

\-Rebalanced their debt

\-Received 3 million dollars from PPP loan (free money) to expand and maintain operations

\-Covid surely added a boost with packages/orders and Amazon was looking for all the help they could get = positive outlook towards/after earnings.

\-The stock has made two runs up near .10 in the past 20 days and there are several somewhat large buyers that have enough confidence to invest at \~.03 a share.

\-Another random confirmation ([http://www.pennystockdream.com/blog/tlss-closed-up-32069-after-announcing-first-quarter-revenue-of-86-million](http://www.pennystockdream.com/blog/tlss-closed-up-32069-after-announcing-first-quarter-revenue-of-86-million))

""The fact that any company reporting such massive sales numbers while simultaneously sitting at less than a quarter million market cap is a bit astounding but it becomes even more unbelievable when taking into account that TLSS is fully audited and SEC reporting, as opposed to opting for the alternative reporting standard. The fact that the company has opened its books to scrutiny from regulatory agencies makes us far more interested in looking further into this one, because it seems to hold serious potential for future gains.""

\-Positive statements from executive team on 4/9 ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14067745&amp;type=8](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/tlss/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&amp;sid=10083299&amp;guid=14067745&amp;type=8))

\-Article from May 4th titled ""5 high volume stocks to add to your watch list"" ([https://microsmallcap.com/5-high-volume-penny-stocks-05-04-20/](https://microsmallcap.com/5-high-volume-penny-stocks-05-04-20/)) that overviewed MVIS, MARK, IZEA, ZOM, and ... TLSS. But, TLSS hasn't moved much yet because the ""to the moon"" train was focused on the other tickers, as I'm sure you know. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-

**They filed for an extension for their 10-Q on 3/24. It's likely they knew they would apply for the PPP loan and it would drastically change how earnings would turn out if they got it. They did get it. They report earnings next week.**

Do your own DD too but this is what I'm coming up with. I'm in for \~115,000 shares at \~ .0295 -.03",2020-05-07

I mean to be fair, before that massive sell-off by 1 investor that scared everyone half to death, it was trending that way.  But this is why you:

1. Never invest more than you can afford to lose
2. Don't invest with your emotions
3. Don't invest when you are late to the party
4. Set stop loses or limits to prevent risk.
5. Do your own DD on a company if you can and remember, basically everyone here is small fries and the real MM's (Market makers) are the primary driving force behind stock movement.

As for hope.... well they do have potential simply because they have connections with MSFT and really good tech. But they are not a giant company and their financials, while improving, are not amazing.  But at least they have over 20% institutional investors which means there is at least a decent amount of confidence in them as a company since 20% is huge for a penny stock.

Always expect the worst and try to assess the risk by finding a floor. Buy low. And don't think that these runs come only rarely, there is at least 1 or 2 every week.

Learn to set trailing stop loses. Small gains are always better than losses, especially on penny stocks. You can't let the ""I got out at X but it went up another 50%"" regret get to you. Getting out green is better than most. The stock market isn't there to make joe schmoe rich. Don't get greedy. Smart, conservative plays will make you richer than diamond hands greed.








No big deal though guys. There's always another play. Learn from this and move on. If this stuff was that easy everyone would be getting rich doing it. The best thing you can do is learn from your mistakes and grow from them",2020-05-07
