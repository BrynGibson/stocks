I'm just some dude, I don't have much experience trading. Honestly it looks like the copper mine is going to happen and I don't doubt it will be pretty profitable. My only doubt is on whether or not the stock is a scam, and if the fact that as I understand it, a bunch of warrants and options are now ITM and the resulting dilution from them being exercised could prevent me from making anything.

A lot of it depends on the companies financials and how they handle their business. A great example is $TRNX. Great product. Always has great news. But the share price is constantly going down and they are always doing r/s. If you feel so confident I would take the advice of some of the more experienced people here and take out your initial investment. That way you never actually lost anything. If you continue to watch it and can see it on a positive consistent uptrend then buy more. Or if it drops really low and you know that that price is lower than what it normally trades at then buy more. If anything you should pull out after a big jump up like this and buy more when the price corrects itself which it always does.,2019-07-18

Good stocks and bad stocks. When they get pumped hard overnight the get dumped just as fast. These folks ain’t interested in Investing. They are interested In trading.

At the end of the day there is money to be made and lost. The last thing to do is think about what could have been, or how long you should have held, or how much earlier you should have gotten in... Focus on the gains you did make, keep making money, and make sure to limit your losses at comfortable levels. Marathon not a race blah blah. Sometimes you over hold and lose it all. Sometimes you under hold and leave out gains.

I sold half my position, paid back my initial investment plus 2,300 bucks in the green. Now I’m riding 500,000 free shares. I should have tripled my initial investment. I’m relatively new to this. Just started a yr ago but I saw this one coming like a freight train. Next time I see the freight train watch out. I’m gonna load hard and TTCM has earned me the capital to do so. 

Rock on boys. We will have a few good weeks left here. Once the dust settles and the world record is broke loom for this to fall off and find a new support level. I’ll be taking a long position (with free shares) at that point until they sellout or uplift. 

Good luck to all.",2019-07-18

In addition to launching its interactive website at www.cannmedlive.com, CannMedLive will also be launching two separate Apps in both Google Play and iTunes marketplace.  The App will be free to medical cannabis users and physicians.  The App will connect patients with physicians in a real-time live online format from the comfort and privacy of the patient’s own home.  This enables a physician to conduct medical consults from either the web or with CannMedLive’s App through the patient’s smartphone.

Physicians will also be able to review and keep track of a patient’s medical history and be able to conduct follow up consults, which are recommended under Health Canada’s regulations and standard practice for medical cannabis users.

CannMedLive has been under development as a collaboration between CeCors, Inc. and Canadian Medical Cannabis Industry professionals and advisors who bring extensive experience in the field of medical cannabis and how it has evolved within the framework of Health Canada’s rules and regulations.  CannMedLive’s portal will make it easy for patients that suffer from a variety of ailments - including and not limited to arthritis, Crohn’s disease, anxiety, glaucoma, inflammation and pain - in being able to obtain medical cannabis therapy and prescriptions through one of Health Canada’s Licensed Producers.",2019-07-18

249,WallStreetDope,eufyhgq,/r/pennystocks/comments/celf73/my_brother_told_me_to_buy_some_random_mining/eufyhgq/,1,If your buying an Australian mining stock your getting twice the normal play. If you live in the US your getting currency exposure and the capital appreciation of the stock. I’d leave some if it goes to $2-3 you’ll hate yourself and obsess about it forever. You’ll check the stock every single day and watch it go higher and higher. For your mental health you have to leave a little in there... trust me.,2019-07-18
