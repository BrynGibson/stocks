34,GermyBones,f8t97k7,/r/pennystocks/comments/e20v5e/help_a_student_out/f8t97k7/,1,"
My story, as a fellow new investor:
36 year old living in Midwest USA, 2 kids and 40k in credit card debt that was brought into our marriage by my partner (not a point of contention, but relevant to my trading philosophy). Started with ""what I could afford to put in"" about a month and a half ago, while working on our budgeting debt consolidation/paydown strategy. I'm usually able to throw a couple hundred a month into my brokerage account, as an experiment to see whether I can out-trade the credit card debt. I've put roughly $500 USD into my account and am sitting around $800 now. So 500€ should be more than enough for a start. I didn't start seriously trading penny stocks until about a month ago. Prior to that I was buying GE and GLDM (gold mini-shares ETF), and tbh I played those close to perfect for my position size and didn't make enough money to continue the experiment.

 I know ""outinvesting my debt"" is a ridiculously silly premise, but I'm a naturally cautious person playing the volatile penny-stocks market, and in a position where I need relatively fast money. I'm averaging about equal to/slightly lower than the credit card debt right now, but I've had weeks as high as 60% and as low as -30%. I'm tied up in 2 ""big"" swing trades right now. $ARGX being about 65% of my portfolio and $TRNX (waiting for the split with Taronis Fuels, which is a bigger gamble for me.) being about 25% the other 10% is in $OGEN and a few options. I expect $AGRX to get approved sooner than their deadline (this is what my options are in.)  So I'm hoping for my all-time average (for first 3 or 4 months) to be around 30-35% when these deals mature. Well above the 24% average credit card interest I'm trying to beat. I'll continue the experiment till I've got 50 grand (10k to keep my portfolio alive and 40k for the high interest debt) or I blow my portfolio on a bad trade.

To avoid imploding my portfolio I have some rules, which I often break (oops.) 

 ALWAYS gather intel before investing (for biotech penny stocks that includes scanning earning reports, knowing upcoming catalysts, knowing past performance and corporate culture,) 

*NEVER* going all in

never YOLOing

 *PLAN* your plays. Have an entry and exit price (or percentage) in mind, set a stop loss. 

Don't compromise your plan without good intel or signals. For example; if you expect a 20% gain but it's struggling around 16% you can watch for signals like a double bottom (bullish) or 3 bar formation (could be either) as your signal to stay in or get out. Technicals or knowing corporate history or drama have saved me a few times and allowed me to take a $2 or $3 loss instead of being tied up for months or taking a $20 loss in a bad investment. 

Avoid FOMO, accept small losses as opposed to getting stuck bag-holding.

Having at least 3 different plays in motion (or 2 plays and 20% of my portfolio in cash, or 1 play and 40% cash) so I'm as diversified as a small time penny trader can be expected to be. Also don't buy people's programs. The info is out there for free. 




Some YouTube channels I like for information/and education:

*Trading Fraternity* has tons of good videos on options trading, plus some small account specific stuff. He does a live trading stream daily which i never get anything out of, but maybe you would. 

*Live Traders* is a simpler more boomer aesthetic of a channel but he does the best technical trading pattern videos I've found. Technicals don't work as well as they used to, though, and can leave you chasing. But knowing the patterns is HUGE on spotting an opportunity still.

*Ricky Gutierrez* kind of obnoxious, gives off very ""influencer"" vibes, but has some great videos on daytrading patterns.

*InTheMoney* also has good tutorials about small account trading. And does some trading challenges that are enlightening to follow.

*Kamikaze Cash* follow the goings on over at wallstreetbets which is... Entertaining, and can be a great example of what not to do. He has some good tutorials on their less asinine strategies.

*Warrior Trading*, a bit more into penny stocks but I'm still unsure on him. He's definitely holding a lot of info back so you'll buy his courses, but we all gotta make a living. You can still learn from the free YouTube content.

And then a channel I follow that just has good budgeting/moneymaking/starting a business/financial minimalist tips in general is *Graham Stevens*. He also talks a lot about real estate a lot, which is a closing window I wouldn't try to get into right now (at least in the US.) Either way, enjoyable to follow and the budgeting is crucial for having money to put into your brokerage account.

Of course all of this is super US-centric.",2019-11-26

It can take years of hard studying to be consistently profitable with penny stocks. If you think you'll have this down in a couple of months and make a few hundred to a few thousand a week then I recommend you donate that 500 euro to charity and move on. It'll be better than losing it on the markets.

It is possible to make money and it's possible to make a decent amount of money but it will be hard and it will take years of practice and losing. 

These are not investments. These are the worst companies. Do not fall in love with the company. Trade the ticker and move on.

If you want this, and I mean you really want this, you can do it. But it will take a lot of study, patience and time. It's not rocket science but the more you learn the more you learn that you know nothing. 

500 is probably too little to start. You'll have to go all-in with your trades to make any decent profit. I'd recommend saving your money up and studying as much as you can until you have 1,500 or more.

Study for 3-6 months with your paper account. Make all the mistakes you can and learn from them. Move onto a real account with real money. Trade with small amounts so you understand the psychological part of trading. I used to shake with nerves when I started with a small account. A $20 profit doesn't seem like a lot but a $5 loss is bearable while learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of gurus out there that want your money. They promise you profits and private jets. Be careful. They are worse than these companies. I recommend going onto YouTube and search how to trade pennystocks. There's a heap of information.  Learn your technicals first then your fundamentals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some rules I've made up along the way.

Cut losses quickly and intelligently. 

These aren't investments.

Success takes time.

You can be wrong on any trade.

Don't predict. Observe and interpret. 

Learn from your mistakes.

Never stop learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I hope that helps. Like I said this is possible but I don't believe this should be a half-assed study. You're either in it to win or you'll lose it all. 90% of traders lose money. Are you willing to work as hard as the 10% that make it?",2019-11-26
