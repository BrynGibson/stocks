1,superchuck01,edego4r,/r/pennystocks/comments/ad63he/hmpq_doing_the_new_stock_market_game_right/edego4r/,1,I own considerable shares in this stock. Got it at sub penny levels. Transparency is everything. Company has no debt. Balance sheet remarkable. Watch and learn as this company will take it to the next level. Patience is a virtue. Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds...PETER LYNCH.,2019-01-06
2,crustycrew,edex3m9,/r/pennystocks/comments/ad7z1n/january_06_2019_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/edex3m9/,1,"Day 4 of raising my stop loss on HSGX(0.12 originally, sold half at .26, stop at 0.21), will watch at open to see how volume looks. Set stop loses if  your trading this, donâ€™t get burned. 

Keeping an eye on SHMP to see if volume increases again like December. What they are doing is super intriguing, but I want to see more information on how they compare to ocean shrimp on a biological and taste level. 

Hope RGSE continues pumping out production and becomes #1 in the solar roof shingle industry. 2019 Q1 and Q2 is when they want production to really be rolling out, and IMO will be the time frame where they learn if it will be a successful company or not as well as some price action. This stock I believe is heavily underrated for what they are providing. Most houses have some sort of shingle system, you have to pay to get them replaced every so often anyways so why not have them benefit you in some sort of way?
