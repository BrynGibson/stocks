1,Stock screener by exchange ?,ak353h,GORILLA_FACE,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ak353h/stock_screener_by_exchange/,1,5,"I have been reading Penny Stocks for Dummies and it highly recommends only buying stocks from the following exchanges:

NYSE MKT (AMEX) - though there is a risk they may get delisted due to requirements

OTC-BB

Is there a stock screener where I can search by either of these markets?  I can only seem to find screeners which use fundamentals or technical analysis.

Finviz seems to be the closest, but using the AMEX filter it only lists stocks over $8.

I have been unable to find anything on OTC-BB.
