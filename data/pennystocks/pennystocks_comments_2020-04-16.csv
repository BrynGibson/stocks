50,sliight,fnnz4hq,/r/pennystocks/comments/g2ogdm/aytu_may_want_to_get_out_now/fnnz4hq/,1,"So to be clear, my posting a news article that was widely distributed, of which I personally picked up from a trader who has hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers that also received that article, ultimately moved a stock from a post maybe a thousand people read (5 upvotes I think). 90% of which are throwing a few hundred dollars tops at any trade. So you think they're market movers...

r/facepalm

Maybe I was trying to warn the people who may not have a lot of money to invest and don't track stuff in real time to ""maybe get out before price tanks"", which interestingly it did. Plus, from what I read if it was true, no more tests... 

I get that it's late,  and you're upset, but did you notice the two hour difference between the news post and response from the people you quoted who technically didn't address the actual logistical shipping issue? From what I saw I believe the CEO posted something about how it's getting fixed at some point, not sure when but dollars to donuts it was after the article not before...

The actual journalist who put the article up on NBC was the one that caused the drop. So those who saw my post and jumped ship can buy back in cheaper if they think it's legit. Those that didn't and think the stock is solid should have nothing to worry about if it's legit as it will rebound.

Hope it's all good and the value jumps back up to where you're profitable again. Good luck!",2020-04-16

It carefully references the limitations on getting the tests from original, then it focuses on confidence that they'll get the approval from China by referencing another article, then refocus on their getting other tests. ""Final stages"" could mean we're negotiating price. So the original negative story was correct, not debunked. 

That was a well crafted response though. Shows what Trump could do if he listened to his PR people vs just talking/tweeting. 

After seeing the response and other info late last night, it's now my personal opinion that the news story was definitely slanted towards creating fear to sell ads, which again in my opinion is all news is about these days. It could have also been designed to tank the stock for the short term... I'm leaning more towards news just being morally corrupt and only caring about ads.  Or, that was an accurate story based on the information at the time, assuming it rolled out before China had commented about not restricting medical.

Anyways, happy to see you'll have had your stock recover a fair amount.  Hopefully it runs up for you... 

What's interesting is that negative story may retrigger it as a more active stock again. It had lost favor of a lot of people...now it's the hot topic at the water cooler again...

As for DECN, they're making covid-19 tests and plan to sell a lot of them. It's getting a lot of attention. They have been around a long time.  


It's getting more and more expensive to buy while everyone is trying to get in before the next announcement.   


Will it actually take off? It's a penny stock, you never know. these are risky. But the FDA is offering EAU for covid tests, and there is a massive demand for them. So, assuming they get the FDA EAU, it will probably take off.

Cells under stress rely more heavily on glycolysis for ATP production, so by inhibiting glycolysis, you target ""stressed"" cells. In the case of COVID, that would be cells infected by the virus which are being hijacked for COVID replication and proliferation. Because COVID also uses glycoproteins as part of it's coat, this pathway is also partially inhibited by ""decoy"" glucose. (Glycoproteins are created using proteins and glucose).

They developed the drug with cancer in mind, which also causes up-regulation of glycolysis in tumor cells.

There are reasons these things happen, a lot of these people on here just repeat things that other people say and don't understand what those things even mean or what is involved in these particular events.

967,bobbrucethe1st,fno1b3w,/r/pennystocks/comments/g2qdcw/biocept_should_i_sell_now_or_wait_i_was_tryna/fno1b3w/,1,"Always search for recent news on the company. Recent meaning , search everyday. I'm not talking about if you are investing in a company like Amazon or something that is long term and hands off. 

I'm 34, if i reflect back to 9th grade, $500 was big bank, it's actual value is shit and if you have no bills, it's nothing. When you compare the amount you paid, to it's price now with the amount you have in, you already lost. You're talking about recouping like $30 here. Unless you are actively learning from these experiences, there's no point in not just going all in.

You got in at a horrible time, it jumped after a ""leaked"" PR on Twitter I think it was. Which was then deleted and the linked site supposedly password protected.  Then they made an official PR, in which it continued upward. Off market hours it jumped up even more, the volume was also immense. It opened Monday and price went down pretty significantly, There was a few big money buys and it continued to rise back up, I believe it maxed at maybe 68 cents during Monday's market hours.

What got me was the direct offering (off market share offering) at 46 cents. This was after the whole hoopla of it hitting like 75 cents or whatever during off market. $10.3 million at 46 cents. 1 day before they started testing. My assumption off that is they needed that money to help fund the testing, and the whole Thursday - Mon open market, was a stunt to get those direct shares sold.

This company definitely seems to mess with PR purposefully, and seems to have a handle on how to directly effect their share price. That isn't automatically a negative, although it's considered a shady business practice. A company can push through with no money for a given amount of time, if they know they have a reward coming that will make up for it.  I think that's them, and this was that. 

That being said, them making money doesn't mean the price will go up, especially if they're greedy and do things like mess with PR just to benefit themselves personally. 

At the price you paid, I would recommend just considering it a loss , keeping the stock, following the events of the company regularly, the price, and using it as an educational tool. 

There is a good chance the share price could hit $1-$2, and you're not losing substantial money if it tanks, so the risk is worth it. Keep in mind that the Governor of California has said numerous times that he wants the whole state to have affordable access to Covid19 testing. He refers to his state as a Nation-State, governs a state that has an economy that is larger than almost every country on the planet and seems to love being a trend setter.

All of these things can equal 1 of 2 things (at your price at least) , the stock tanks, or it blows up. Either way, rest assured that you are neither winning or losing big. That is why at the end of the day, this is definitely a stock you should hold, and use as a tool for future investments.",2020-04-16

The key thing here is to only buy the strong companies with cash on hand, think ConocoPhillips, Exxon, Chevron etc. I plan on buying the XLE (and possibly XOP) etfs which are focused on the industry as a whole, weight strongly in favor of large companies. I wanted to buy today on the oil price downturn but for inexplicable reasons it was up %10.62! It wasn't just inexplicable to me but everyone on CNBC, Fox biz, everywhere, I am now waiting for a red day and will be putting some solid money in there. Playing the oil upswing directly is basically impossible unless you actually buy physical oil, there is no fund of any sort that directly matches the oil price over time. Looking for companies I focus mostly on how far down they are. COP (conoco) is down more than Chevron for example, but it should rebound similarly well, so I'd weight that one higher. The best advice is probably just wait for a down day and buy into XLE, if it goes back to where it was pre-corona it will double in value, which makes it have almost as much if not more upside potential as any major oil company individually would have, but with less risk. I'm kinda ranting here but it's helping me understand wtf I'm doing which is nice :) Oil penny stocks are probably all bad ideas, those companies don't have enough cash to avoid restructuring within a few years.",2020-04-16

I have a family of two kids, and one I disowned but still is forced to live in my house ... and a wife with Alzheimers who doesn't know who I am anymore but it's okay because I just tell her she's working at the circus and then she believes it so I convince her to start juggling and balancing on a ball and it's really funny to watch her fail and get desperately sad as her confusion gets worse and worse as she falls off the ball over and over.........................

Look, I have a lot on my plate, and I obviously need the money to provide for my little army of hooligan minions that I wish I didn't have to deal with. Is this what you like /u/Gwalup ? You like seeing me suffer? You like seeing me throw away my entire Trump check into a false promise of a stock? I'm now taking out loans on loans on loans from the bank just to afford a McChicken for me and the two kids, the reject, and my confused wife who I convinced this morning worked as a Zookeeper. She's running down the street right now chasing a cat because I convinced her the tiger had escaped. 

You fucking bastard I want to get out of this hell hole. I need a penny stock to skyrocket so I can run away with my two kids, pay for the euthanization of my wife and well I don't know I probably will ship off the shitty child to my wife's parents with a hefty check, that oughta take care of him for a second.
