I don’t know if they will eventually do a reverse split, but since they are working in the next “WOW me” apps and tech, I’d say play it if it moves. AR is going to be the next big tech and will likely start to infiltrate FANG stocks. Here is a link that I usually send out to show people the extremes of where we are going. $VUZI is another up and coming AR stock and of course $MSFT has their HoloLens coming out next year.

Results were not surprising given it is an OTC stock. Maybe there is some more pump coming and maybe not. but based on the past ventures of mr CEO I would be cautious. As for me this thing has already had a small pump that pushed it over its 5yr high. how much does it have left??? It's a gamble, news better be very good. Could it have a run? Sure but I like something less iffy. Plus what if that CEO starts dumping those 280mil. OS shares on everyone.
