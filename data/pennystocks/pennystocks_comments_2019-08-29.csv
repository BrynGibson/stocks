27,kylekyleashton,eyjn3zz,/r/pennystocks/comments/cx27hg/cbd_sector_just_got_a_huge_endorsement_from_one/eyjn3zz/,1,"I get a ton of samples working as a budtender and there are only 3 that stick out in my mind. One of my favorites is a tincture from Green Revolution called ""beauty sleep"" and works amazing for sleep. I dont even struggle to sleep and I am tempted to use it nightly, and people with insomnia buy 5 boxes at a time. If you dont have much of a tolerance to edibles it's freaking amazing, but even for heavy users/abusers it's fairly effective. 

Probably the best product hands down is called a ""Healing Stick"" by Wildflower. I believe this is a product u can order online if u live within the U.S. I use it on my knees and I feel 5 years younger, it actually gives lasting relief into the next day. Kim Kardashian just did some advertisement for it recently at her bridal shower and it was a big deal for the company, they are tiny company so it was kind of wild to get that kind of recognition. For the doubters this is my #1 recommendation, you feel the effects immediately. If I sleep on my neck wrong I use it and 10 minutes later my shoulders are loose and I feel great.

The last one isnt the best, but it isnt the worst either. It's called ""Dragon Balm"" it's like Tiger Balm with CBD. Same idea as the Wildflower stick but only about 70% as effective in my opinion. 50% less expensive though, so not a bad value if ur just trying CBD out without much expectation.",2019-08-29
