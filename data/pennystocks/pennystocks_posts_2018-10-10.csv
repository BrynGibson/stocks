6,Making plays..Enerdynamic Hybrid Technology,9n3pvv,wannaberichguy777,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9n3pvv/making_playsenerdynamic_hybrid_technology/,1,0,"[EHT.vn](https://EHT.vn)  or EDYYF is making some good plays (Enerdynamic Hybrid Technology) ...This company's vision is easy to get behind but at the end of the day we want to make some money!.. i will give my pros and cons of what i have been hearing from people and what i have researched.  Between getting the green light for the housing project with its African partner Maple Leaf Holdings to build 40,000 homes in  Burkina Faso today and 100,000 houses in Ghana set to start in the 2nd quater of 2019 , also talks with large construction company's in Pakistan this company has lots of potential to make money. Now that this project in Burkina Faso is underway they can focus on executing the project and make some revenue . For the Ghana project the UN has helped fund them, they are set to build 10,000 houses a year out of 100,000.. the project is slated for 60,000 2-bedroom units and 40,000 3-bedroom units.  The 2 bedroom houses go for $33,600 each and 3 bedroom houses at 42k each..  the EHT/UCI  ((UCI, a Ghanaian company involved in the design, engineering and construction of housing))  joint venture with their partner currently estimates a net margin of 7.5%-12% (approx. US$2,520-US$4,032 per each 2-bedroom unit) and will provide future updates as the project progresses. Also they are in talks with AhmadMedix (Pvt.) Limited a  Pakistan company which is part of the Izhar Group of Companies, which have become  one of the largest multidimensional engineering entity in the Pakistan electro mechanical services, they will be sending someone there to show them the design and how quick it can be built. For the pros and cons ...

pros - lots of upside for a penny stock , big contracts for lots of revenue , great vision for the people of the world, patented building material for the house, clean energy solution, good partners , UN backed project. 

&amp;#x200B;

cons- small company , contracts could be to big to fill due to not enough production of the building material , always a possibility the project wont meet the deadlines...

&amp;#x200B;

IMO- Like any company .. failure is not an option and my only concern is that they cant meet the deadlines but like i said failure is not an option at this point.  They have a vision that can make them money and offer affordable housing to people in 3rd world country's with solar electricity for cheap , with good partners and government backing them up THATS HUGE to me .

In the era of GDPR and increased concerns about data security, many organizations may realize that their sensitive information is at risk ‚Äì but not realize how great their risk is. Worse yet, many have no idea how to even begin to address their exposure, given how much disparate data and information they possess. This webinar will discuss how Online Business Systems‚Äô Quick Start Program can help organizations begin to tackle their data governance issues, while also addressing:

* How to select an 'aspirational' governance framework (and not be overwhelmed)
* The mechanisms for comparison and scoring of your capabilities
* Some of the tooling supplied as part of the Quick Start program
* Expectations of outputs - strategic and tactical
* Review of recommended controls (administrative and technical) that may be placed as stopgap measures

Attendees will also gain an understanding of how important document classification and identity governance are to keeping an organization secure. Those who join the webinar will additionally learn:

* How quickly recertification campaigns can be successfully executed ‚Äì and how easily
* How quickly identities can be tied together, even as more applications shift to the cloud
* How your organization can govern access to sensitive data repositories
* How to discover if you‚Äôre in possession PII ‚Äì and what to do if you are

This webinar will be one-hour long, and the event will be recorded for those unable to attend the live event.

They have announced they are getting into sales in Europe and are looking into acquiring other companies.  They are pushing to become one of industry's largest publically traded cannabis and hydroponics supply companies.  One to watch for sure.
