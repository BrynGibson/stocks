Administrative expense went up 40% last year.

Significant negative working capital (including $3.1 million in accounts payables and only $444 thousand in cash).

Every penny stock has some smelly parts but what really concerns me about this company is they are trying to do everything.  They’re into wireless, home phones, credit cards, debit cards, money orders, software portals, cryptocurrency, rewards programs and online games of chance (online spin of a wheel to win a prize.). Seems like they are trying to do everything.  Usually those companies accomplish nothing.
