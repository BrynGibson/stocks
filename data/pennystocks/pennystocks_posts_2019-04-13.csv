3,To the person who wanted a Timothy Sykes review,bcmwx2,born2rock4life,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bcmwx2/to_the_person_who_wanted_a_timothy_sykes_review/,0,20,"I can attest that what he teaches is extremely profitable. Also look up Steven Dux and William Karajan. Both share his strategies, and Steven was a student of Timothy Sykes who turned his $20k into $970k within 13 months. He has a lot of great content/DVD’s that teach everything from shorting, penny stocks, reading SEC filings, basics and fundamentals, and more. If you follow what he teaches and not just copy cat what he trades live, you will find success. 

Anyone saying he is a scam either doesn’t agree with his style, doesn’t like his character (he can be abrasive, but is bluntly honest,) and/or most likely has never been involved in his programs and teaching.

He gives the basic secrets to his style away in this interview I linked below, and I would say judge for yourself based on whether or not his style appeals to you. Everyone has a method that works best for them, and the more you hone in on a style and perfect it, the more consistent you will become and more profitable as well.

He teaches both long and short methodologies, so even if shorting isn’t your ideal style, you can still find other programs and lessons of his that teach long strategies, scalping, etc.

I haven’t had the extra income to invest in his challenge myself, but I’ve watched most all of the content while at a friends house and can speak to this as a review. I’ve since become more consistent in attaining profits, quicker and less emotional about cutting losses quickly, and many other key elements that makes the difference in becoming part of the 10% of traders who don’t fail.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions further, or reply in-line and I’d be glad to answer them.
