Is this possible if you have stop losses set up on all held stocks?

I guess I'm just wondering what ways people lose large percentages.",2019-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bi151x/what_are_the_biggest_ways_people_lose_when/
1,how does averaging down work?,bi3hd2,throwaway091832,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bi3hd2/how_does_averaging_down_work/,1,0,"so i had a 1.50 average on a stock. bought shares at a lower price and got my average down to 1.20. but then i sold those same cheap shares for pretty much the exact same price, but my average stayed at 1.20? should it not have gone back to 1.50?

if it works this way, could i not just buy and sell cheap shares continually to get my average down without even actually spending that money or keeping the cheap shares?",2019-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bi3hd2/how_does_averaging_down_work/

On that note:

KULR Technology Group (OTCQB: KUTG)  has co-developed alongside NASA, a ""Thermal Runaway Shield"" that  acts as a heat sink (helps to keep battery cooler) but can also prevent battery explosions (thermal runaway propagation) in battery packs: [https://www.kulrtechnology.com/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/) 

  
NOTE: There is no affiliation between KUTG and Tesla.  I'm simply pointing out that KUTG provides technology that can prevent what was described in the article.

**This is a quote from Dr. Eric Darcy, battery systems lead at NASA, about KULR's Thermal Runaway Shield:** 

“KULR’s solution is the lightest weight battery heat sink option NASA has evaluated to date that has excellent promise to prevent thermal runaway propagation with the highest energy density COTS Li-ion cell designs,” said by Dr. Eric Darcy, NASA Johnson Space Control lead battery principal. “To date, NASA has not found a design solution with as much promise for preventing Li-ion battery TRP with as positive temperature margins on the adjacent cells while also being very lightweight.”

My family has invested in KUTG and I am personally acting as a consultant for KUTG and have been compensated in shares for that role.

There is obviously risk of loss when buying or selling securities and generally even greater risk associated with buying or selling micro-cap stocks. Some real challenges faced by micro-cap companies include raising capital, increasing liquidity, attracting institutional investors, gaining analyst coverage, and general mistrust of the micro-cap market. Micro-cap companies also tend to lack in resources and often struggle to commercialize their products or services in a meaningful way.",2019-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bi399n/life_death_and_spontaneous_combustion_heres_why/

4,PSA on the wild wild west,bhyiij,stepmill_jack,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bhyiij/psa_on_the_wild_wild_west/,75,12,"So it’s Saturday morning and it’s beautiful and I’m appreciating life again from my bodhi tree Buddha pose.

And I’m in a philanthropic state of mind.

I was chatting with this kid in the subway who shoulder surfed my tweeting and asked me for advice. He invested money on subpenny stocks and they are all in no bid at the moment.

And when I call subpennies the Wild West... it really is. Imagine the 1850s west where a couple of dudes on horseback attack you, take your money and leave you for dead. That is exactly what happens as the SEC is largely asleep. 

I want to do another thread for penny stocks over .01 but let’s keep this focused on the subpenny realm. We have all done this in our youth.

Before you invest, few things to consider:

1. Take a look at the outstanding shares. If it’s in billions, it needs billions in volume to move the pig. Mostly never happens.

2. Take a look at the authorized shares... some have 25 billion of them. That means .... the float can be increased any time and they have plenty of shit in waiting to add to the pile.

3. Most penny traders look at history and go... on the same date last year, it was at .04 and now it is .0022... so it should go back to .04 and I will make money... BUT, that .04 last year was on a lower float - management must already have diluted the shares all the way down to .0022. They are selling to new investors who are now holding the pile of shit.

4. What is dilution? The miscreants aka management always use a news PR to pump the stock - 2 years ago many used bitcoin to pump it - like xxx holdings now exploring bitcoin mining - and the stock jumps - new buyers, old holders including management sell and take the money - that is how they pay themselves. Now it is cannabis.

5. Why the news to dilute and dump to new shareholders? Because there is convertible debt obligations to be met and dumping to you is also their salary because these companies make negative earnings - cash flow is a joke. 

6. Reverse mergers and shells - this is another PR to boost the stock and dump it to new shareholders. Reverse mergers are always a sham because the one doing the reverse merger is a shell. They are both run by the same or similar management team and their only objective is to take your money.

7. Front loaders  - those who pump on twitter or stocktwits or Reddit are mostly front loaders. About 50 traders work together and front load a ticker at no bid. Then they tweet the hell out of it and make new buyers buy the stock. When the stock doubles or triples - they dump and move on. 

8. Pumpers - other pumpers are bots. Most accounts on twitter shilling penny stocks are bots. When you see a tweet with a set of tickers, it is always a bot.

9. If you still want to invest in this, buy at .0001 and dump at .0002. If you wait for .005 or .01, you are never getting there. There will be a few times you will get to .005 and that is only because you got extremely lucky. Most penny traders (non front loaders) lose their money.

10. These are not real companies. Some have an address but if you visit the address you will see the building is empty. Or perhaps one little space in the cleaning closet with a phone. And no staff.

I would like to add more but after coffee. I’m sure others will have excellent advice too. If you do, add them.",2019-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bhyiij/psa_on_the_wild_wild_west/
