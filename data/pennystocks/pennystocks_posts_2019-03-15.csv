2,Risk control?,b1gvuj,sliight,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1gvuj/risk_control/,1,7,"Morning all, was hoping some of you could share how you control your risk.

As an example, when I was playing poker at high levels years back I would only ever put 15% of my current bankroll in play. So if I lost it all, I'd still have a bankroll, and next time around my buy in was lessened since I could only do 15%  of the new balance after loss. Winning sessions of course increase future buy in amounts, sometimes to the point of moving up in limits (higher blind structure no limit games typically).

Does anyone implement a similar system? Or do you just measure risking the portion of your bankroll based on strength of news releases or available info? To the point where you may go all in?  If you go all in is it all or nothing or do you put a stop in to protect half or something?

For fun.... What's your biggest return on one stock within a week or less? Guessing there's maybe a couple a year that go from fractions of a cent to pushing past the single cent mark to upwards of a dime...

Last one... Has there ever been a fraction of a cent stock that does a complete recovery back to a full value normal trading stock? Something that goes over like ten bucks? Seems like if that happened done people could just retire...

Thanks again for the great subreddit, and curious to see your response!",2019-03-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1gvuj/risk_control/

4,Hostile takeover? Ownership?,b1grcx,sliight,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1grcx/hostile_takeover_ownership/,2,4,"I'm new to trying to manage my own investments and having some fun here trying to learn about quick gains through this subreddit. Lots of great info so far, and have made a few bucks with my small getting my feet wet buys...

I've been wondering about the overall price of a share compared to outstanding. I was thinking that if you could get that magical 51% ownership mark that I believe you take control of the company right?

Is this something that's happened before with a penny stocks? Seems like when a share is valued at fractions of a penny it could be bought out pretty easy.

However, I'm assuming the primary reason is that the main owner holds their shares to retain control over the company vs selling. Figure if they're still going to work they'd be hoping to create value to drive up shares so what they have would be worth some real loot.

I'd think though that there might be times when the primary owner has that well under 50% mark but still hold that majority stock holder situation? So the shares could be out there for buying. Guessing again though that this would drive up the price causing other current investors to want to hold which just drives up the price more...

Am I missing something or is that about it?

Please do your due diligence.********

Hi team, 

I am following up on my previous post back 29 days ago. Since then the stock is up 35% and big catalysts coming up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/apxu41/mrs_mission_ready_solutions_starts_trading_at_feb/

**What has changed since the previous post?**

1)  MRS completed Unifire Inc acquisition on February 14th and was conditionally approved by the TSX to start trading pending submission of business plans documents for Unifire Inc. They're still working on this to get the full approval.

2) Unifire received $4 billion contract split 6 ways among the 6 licensed companies.
**Unifire Receives TLS Contract Extensions**
On March 7, 2019, Unifire was awarded a bridge contract (the ‚ÄúSOE Bridge Contract‚Äù) with the Defense Logistics Agency (‚ÄúDLA‚Äù) to extend its current Tailored Logistics Services (‚ÄúTLS‚Äù) Special Operations Equipment (‚ÄúSOE‚Äù) contract for an additional year with the new expiration date being March 6, 2020. The SOE Bridge Contract ‚Äì carrying a maximum dollar value of USD$4 billion ‚Äì was awarded to the six incumbent TLS SOE contract holders, including Unifire, and will continue coverage of the full line of SOE and incidental services under the DLA Troop Support SOE TLS program. Additional information on the SOE Bridge Contract can be viewed at the following link:

https://dod.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract-View/Article/1779133/

3)  MRS is doing a private placement at 0.25 which is rumoured to be oversubscribed. The private placement is wrapping up shortly possibly within the next 5 business days.

****What are the next catalysts?****
We do not know how much of the $4 billion for the next 365 days Unifire received. I think thats confident information but we will know once the acquisition if fully complete and audited financial statements are sent to shareholders.

We still have yet to see the awards for the DLA contracts which total up to $33 billion for the next 10 years. That's the catalyst.
