Some great consolidation between .18-.20 the last week. This thing is really prepping for the next leg up beautifully! Accumulation is steady as they come and RSI is hovering mid 50s I believe giving this plenty of room to run above 20 before they release their 10Q by May 15th.

Won‚Äôt be much holding this back up to .40 come mid May when the news drops. No fluff PRs here from the company - you‚Äôre in before the news drops, or you‚Äôre chasing on the way up when it‚Äôs too late
