226,DrDewclaw,dtlpujq,/r/pennystocks/comments/7umas6/i_just_downloaded_robinhood_a_couple_weeks_ago/dtlpujq/,1,"Looking at BPMX, the reasons I can see to support your decision to hold into friday/over the weekend is 2 things. First thing, stock do better on fridays. Secondly, looking at BPMX over the past 365/1D, the 20D and 50D EMA's came into a squeeze, with the price reacting to bounce out between the two. Today was the first day where the price broke above the 20D/50D EMA, and it closed about .04 above the 50D EMA. Some stocks when they break above the 50D EMA it acts like a new support for further price action. If the price climbs tomorrow I'd say it's safe to hold until it reachs the 200D EMA, where I would most likely sell. If it bounces south off the 200D it was a good sell, if it bounces above then you're still looking at a massive 50% gain if you were to get in right now and sell at the 200D EMA (.2858). Additionally There was a lot of volume at market open and also market close, and we saw a ~.03 price gap up right before market close. People are watching this stock for sure, and with a potential new support at the 50D EMA (.14) I think pending tomorrows opening performance I would hold onto until aforementioned price levels. Possible stoploss at .23 after it breaks .25 and let it ride, if it breaks the 200D EMA(.28) I'd guess it'd be a really high price spike and I'd sell the hype at like .34. Or it could just go to shit also, who knows, but thats my TA on it based on EMA's.

-competition exists, and also works, but no word yet on which is better or why. 

-their most recent option for reverse split just expired, providing some peace of mind in the near term.

-if the product continues testing well, it would seem they’d be a good candidate for a partner, or acquisition (completely guessing here)

All in all, these things say hold. Even if it drops to pre-show levels, I’ll still hold. Stop loss set at .125 and forget it for a few days. Plan to look for news daily, but only look at stock weekly to keep my nerves down. ",2018-02-01

Don’t be a little bitch and triple up. 

Do extensive research on the company as far as low key news about the CEO/CFO and look into their work history and see if they’re shady.

There’s a lot of potential here for a payoff and you’re not risking much.

If you participate in financings via this method you have a much better chance of beating the retail investor. Generally, in sub-agreements, you will get common shares plus a warrant. Warrants are the real sell as they are pretty much free shares at a bit of a higher price. Canadian deals have four month holds before the stock is free trading, if you're an American participating in a Canadian deal, then you will have a 6 month hold.

I typically use the breakout board and most read/posted on iHub to look for stocks with volume. I happened to see TPAC with a ton of volume which was from dilution. The iHub board page for TPAC had some nice visuals and I checked out their website. The company was in aerospace and was rumored to have a contract with Boeing.

What I've learned about penny stocks is that it's all about what 'could be' and the hype mill around those rumors. 

It sounds funny but often the stocks that have a nice website and well laid out mission tend to do better than the no name stocks with no info.

I bought 6k worth since I knew the dilution would be over. 

I caught it at .0002 just as the dilution was stopping.

This is also part of my strategy. Buy when there is dilution and you know it will end.

I told myself I'd be in this until a penny.

So as it rose it up I did not sell. When I saw it hit .0068 and then drop again, I sold half around this area. Then it tested the same area (.0068) but could not go further. I sold the rest.

So with penny stocks you really have to know the technicals and it has to have enough volume to exit.

Although I do own a small amount of bitcoin and currently own 1 pot stock, had XXII and turned a quick profit on it. I stick much more to tech and biotech/pharma. I read on here and other conversations regarding penny stocks and look for what people are talking about and see if anything intrigues me. Then I dig into it, look at the company and see what they do. Are they making sales or just developing product. Did they just start making sales? What are their forecasts? Where is their stock price?

Here are 3 different scenarios. 1. As far as stock price has it doubled since people started talking about it? No fundamentals to support the increase? I stay away. 2. If the stock price has increased slightly and they just started production or they had small sales last year and are reporting much larger sales YTD, I would buy. 3. If they just had a successful Phase 2 clinical, I typically would buy.  How much would depend on how much I like the company and products, these can turn huge, but can also become worthless.

I am holding on 1 that falls into #2, OROCF, I bought at $2.29 when they were just starting ramping up production. I sold half at $5.20 and made my investment back.
