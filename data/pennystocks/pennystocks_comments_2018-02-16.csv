That is completely right.  You are seeing OTC which not supported on Robin Hood.  

For trading I'll give you the quick breakdown.  

Robin Hood, free but no OTC. 

Ustocktrade. $1 a trade, no OTC but unlimited trades.  

Interactive brokers, Charles Schwab, fidelity, other major brokers, most are $5 a trade and can trade OTC.
