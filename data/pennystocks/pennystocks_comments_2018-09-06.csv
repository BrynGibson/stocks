It's very odd for them to want to convert so much to preferred when they have basically 0 net worth right now. It could possibly be that they're converting board member's common's to preferred in anticipation of future failure.

FDA rejected them last October, not because the drug is bad, but for dosage and some packaging stuff

The reason I purchased back at 0.1174 was because the storage tech they produce. They have storage that operates just as fast as memory. That would change the way PC work!!! ...if/when the hardware cost drops down enough to become attractive for wider use. For example I own a small VPS hosting company and although our SSD storage is fast compared to what's average now, using  Netlist new hardware would be 100 times the speed! But the cost is not get worth the upgrade. If that happens and they gain major clients like SanDisk, Kinston memory, hosting companies, apple or other cellphone or PC manufacturers, NASA because the storage speed would me less need to upgrade satellites as fast because software on ever level is destined for slower storage anyway. It would lower the need for caching to memory as well meaning systems can be designed differently. Etc etc.etc",2018-09-06

So say it's 5 dollars. You set a stop loss for 4.75. If it continues up to 8 dollars you can follow it set another at 7.50 or something. If it decides to come down it automatically kicks you out at your stop loss number. It's a way to safely secure your green profit. ,2018-09-06
