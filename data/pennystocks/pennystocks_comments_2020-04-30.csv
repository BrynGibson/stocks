Making strong progress in the drone delivery market. (This likely has something to do with the video rumor that suggests a new drone being launched in partnership with Amazon.)

COVID-19 pandemic is leading to stronger demand for commercial drone delivery.

Australian University is developing pandemic drones.

UAVs intended to spray crops are being modified to spray disinfectant over large infection zones.

The company is ramping up production of complex electrical components and testing equipment.

Software platform is seeing strong progress in Florida in the hemp farming space.

UAVS has already seen positive comments although the platform was just launched.

Other states are expected to follow in this hemp grower software platform.

The company is in active discussions to identify specific needs of various states. However, this contact has taken a back seat to COVID-19.

The company believes that Hemp Overview can become a cornerstone in hemp compliance.

UAVS is scaling back other opportunities to pay more attention to hemp farming and commercial drone delivery opportunities.

CEO will resign on May 5th.

New CEO is expected to be announced in the next few days.

Absolutely no mention of the drone partnership with Amazon rumor.

Company will not be rebranding.

UAVS has applied for small business funding but would not say if they did or did not receive funds.

CEO is stepping down for personal reasons.

His belief in the company is what is keeping him on in the chairman role.

Having been burned by DECN when I held too long, I decided early on that I would sell right before the conf call, heeding the saying ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" so I got out at 3.84 and tripled up. Sure the stock went to 5.15, so with my trail-stop set at $0.40 the best I could have done on this is $4.75, about .91 better than I did... but with only 77 shares I missed out on what? $70 but I gained +$200 and got out.

1. Companies exaggerate their value to attract investors. It is the responsibility of the investor to evaluate if a company is good or no good according to their investing goals.

2. I am a gambler and love to take chances with my money. The only hope for me is to channel that risk-taking (degenerate?) behavior into an investment strategy. God help me.

3. There is an old saying -  ""there is nothing new under the sun."" I think the human desire to want to catch lightning in a bottle can cause unwise decisions. Going forward I will make trading decisions based whether or not I can take profits instead of how big the potential upside of a trade.

4. It is almost impossible to evaluate a company from a distance. If the particular business of a company is unfamiliar, it is best to find analysis from a third party with experience evaluating that particular business type/sector. Penny stocks are difficult for this reason - who knows if these little companies will ever increase their usefulness in the real world? Therefore it is important to gather information (that is, DD and reading everything one can read) before jumping into the pool. Again, I truly believe it takes a gambler's mentality to trade penny stocks and the best strategy is to simply take profits.

Nonetheless I made $250 on a $300 input - not terrible for a day's work. I will keep it on the watch list. Who knows. Maybe they can turn it around in the near future.

This is oversimplified and ignores the base valuation that doesn't really move, but let's do a thought experiment and imagine that X moves. 

If X loses 10% and goes to 90, 3X loses 30% and goes to 7. From here X gains 10%, and goes to 99 - 3X gains 30% and goes to 9.1. 

X is fluctuating a lot, so it keeps doing this. 

-10%
X = 89.1, 3X = 6.78

+10%
X = 98.01, 3X = 8.81

We can see the pattern already forming after just a couple of fluctuations.


So at this point, if you had invested in X, you would only be down 2%. But because of the decay experienced by 3x ETFs under volatility, if you had invested in 3X you would be down 12%. X would have to move substantially to put 3X back into the green, and your profits would be less than they would be if you had invested in X itself (unless it spikes like crazy, which is why 3x ETFs are good for short term and day trading).",2020-04-30

This is a quick depiction of how it works:

Fraudster Sykes buys a stock. **then**, notifies the brainless sheep of his watchlists, his chatrooms, etc. **then**, the sheep start pumping said stock with all their life savings (because they're idiotic sheep duh) **then**, said stock price moves up plus volume starts spiking (like hell) **then**, said stock will begin building up momentum with price rally and volume which will then get pinged by other retail traders' screeners and scanners (non-Sykes sheep) **then**, these retails will also jump into invest in said stock, they then go on StockTwits, Ihub, twitter, reddit talking about this stock, which causes it to pump even more

*by this point this stock is literally mooning on a 100%+ rally and the volume is already at least 20-30x higher than average*

**then**, fucktard Sykes proceeds to close his position after everyone pumped it for him (good job sheep), then notifies chatroom, and then they dump which causes price to drop a little, everyone starts panick selling, and eventually the price crashes down  burning

this is how Sykes and almost all these chatrooms/watchlists/alerts systems work, and while they profit off the liquidity you create for them they're also robbing you in broad daylight with their ripoff subscription models",2020-04-30

The only thing I cared about is a double confirmation from his trade alerts. Once I see something interesting on my scanners (news, unusual volume, gappers etc) and then TS sends out an alert and his alert is exactly what I am looking at prior to him sending it. 99% of the time my trade wins. Double confirmation. The dude is a great short seller. His strategy is very very very simple hence the name pump &amp; dump. Some stocks pump on news and you could ride them, or dump when everyone takes profit and you can short them, really easy stuff you just need the right tools. Unfortunately all the tools are payed, you can pay for Options flow data, news scanners, bla bla or pay him and get it done and learn. His DVD‚Äôs are crap so don‚Äôt brother.

At least $40 ($400 would be better, so you can chase more/learn more faster). In my experience it‚Äôs hard to learn lessons from theory - the fear and pain of the downside needs to be real to be felt.  Also, I recommend you open an account that accommodates penny/OTC trading if you want to have access to these opportunities - RH is very limited in that regard.  I have a Schwab account and have been very happy with it. (BTW, started with Robinhood and still use it for quick research because I like the interface.

I'd suggest you post this to the sub in it's own post, a lot of people probably didn't make this connection. In the crated drone the grey bubble seems to be a semi-translucent LED housing, possibly as a power indicator, it likely lights up to amazon's orange when turned on like in the other pic.

Essentially, protected from losing any money. It left me with $200 total gain, but had I left when I should have (pre-call) I'd be up another $500.

Someone else said it well, buy the hype, sell the news. But I believe the 3/1 rule. Sell your positions if you're up 30% and be happy because if your other trades go down 10% and you sell, you're still in the green and beating ""the market average"" of 7%.

That's a loaded question. No, no one is getting upset because they ""bought into the hype."" They get upset because they were lied to from insiders in a clear P&amp;D scheme. You act like the drone video was a commercial; it wasn't. It was clearly some kind of internal video, or in retrospect some pump and dump bait with plausible deniability for the con artists behind it.

Besides that, the company didn't even announce a new partnership with *anyone* which is what the meeting was claimed to be for. The meeting was basically to announce the CEO was stepping down and running off with his ill gotten gains. I don't think someone should be in a cage because I believed their opinionated hype, I think they should be in a cage for committing *securities fraud,* and I say that having made 200% over my initial investment.

Now whether those count as two separate positions or the second is simply an expansion on the first position, thus the question becomes: is selling all 28 shares 2 day trades or one? For that...

Pre market is the main scan I use I check it every morning 30-40 min before open. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúlow float gappers‚Äù scan. 
Last price: 1-20
Gap up: more 4%
Shares float: less 50M
Volume: more 5000

All I‚Äôm looking for is high gappers up on news with low float. I like to trade breaks of pre-market highs and pullbacks. Works well especially since corona. 

Mid day is simple.
Last: 1-20
Float: less 50M
Volume: more 1M
And I use relative volume: greater than 2

I also have alerts for stocks being halted which are sometimes great to jump into.

Swing trades I look for stocks up 15-20% or more on the day with volume over like 200K. If they have good news to accompany it I will watch. Stocks usually run for a couple days and I might buy if it‚Äôs breaking over resistance.

Example: today UAVS popped up on my scanner bc it had heavy volume above average and I got in after it showed strength and my entry was first pullback. 

Also CAPR was on the top of my pre market scan. Once it broke VWAP and showed strength I bought multiple pullbacks.",2020-04-30

I think this is the key right here. I'm betting that their mapping systems are something that Amazon wants to implement into their prime air service. Why would Amazon want such a small company?  Its cheap. They could hire a bigger company sure, but they'd pay more. They could also hire this little 10 man company for a fraction of the price and lock down what they need. I dont feel like it's their production that Amazon wants.

If the reason is yours and yours alone, why not allow day trading with lower margin amounts? Why can't someone with $1k day trade, or shit, $10kwith a value of margin that is comparable to the $10k example you gave on a $25k account?

John of Waypoint, $OZSC IR contact, has been doing a good job of keeping shareholders in the loop with what‚Äôs going on whenever possible while not revealing any material, insider info, imo.  

Brian Conway, interim CEO of $OZSC and founding partner of Waypoint who sold his stake in Waypoint so he wouldn‚Äôt have a conflict of interest, has been doing great working with Cathy Chis, Founder of PCTI, in bringing PCTI, www.PCTI.com, public through a RM.  Mr. Conway has completed a DPA, debt purchase agreement, with all of the original 17 lenders of Ozop Surgical where they each sold 20% of their convertible notes thus locking their remaining stake for 90 days and then they‚Äôll be paid off in full and then the RM will occur.  

An 8k is expected on Monday, May 11th disclosing that the DPA‚Äôs have all been received from the lenders and no more conversions will occur.  There may still be a little more overhang but dilution will completely stop any day for a minimum of 90 days.  This should soon be reflected in the stock price imo as retail has been soaking up all of the debt holders convertible notes over the past 6 weeks or so.  The stock $OZSC should go on a very nice run.

That‚Äôs interesting to think about. I think this company(PCTI) definitely has potential in the public markets. They have solid clients and there‚Äôs promise in the utility energy sector. Their revenues are pretty good, and increasing every year, with rumours of very high $$$ contracts coming. However there is a reason the company went public in OTC. It‚Äôs a cheap way to go public. I think PCTI put themselves in a bit of a hole to accommodate taking on new contracts, and really stretch the business to expand.  

Cathy took a loan from a lender with $2m to offer if she just use this ticker(OZSC) to go public. She says: yeah sure why not? money and a ticker to go public!Whether she knew it or not, OZSC was riddled with convertible debt, to be turned into shares and dilute the O/S. Brian has transferred the debt to fewer lenders, consolidating it and slowing the flow of increasing shares. But the debt is still there and it will likely all be paid by retail. 

If you want to invest in PCTI this is where it‚Äôs going for now: paying their lenders for the shares they got for sub-penny. After the merger and all the debt is paid its a whole different ball-game. From there it‚Äôs ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù time. 3 things need to happen to fully recover: 

1. Buybacks will be necessary to make the SS attractive again.
2. Uplisting needs to happen. At least OTCX, preferably NASDAQ. 
3. Hire some proper IR that isn‚Äôt Brian Conway. And learn to please your investors. After all, that‚Äôs where Cathy‚Äôs precious funding is coming from. 

If these three things happen, I think PCTI will expand fast relative to other specialty hardware businesses. Their plans for the utility energy sector alone could make them a household name, not to mention their ongoing military contracts and auto manufacturer contracts. This will take time. I‚Äôm long PCTI &gt;2 years. 

(TL;DR): Yes I see this company recovering post merger. Yes I think it will be a long road.",2020-04-30

Sure they could develop their own drones/mapping software/whatever would be the incentive for a partnership if there is one, but that would be more costly than paying someone who already did the work to use theirs.

Limit order is a ceiling. A lot of penny stocks gap up for no more than an hour for a 40%+ increase of rumors or news. Having a limit order will help you catch these quick rises. Additionally, for moments of intense volatility, it works as well. UAVS touched $5 for a moment today. Anyone with a limit order got in here

A stop order is your floor. Let's say TTI reaches .75 at open tomorrow. You want to ride the high, but dont want to get burned and still want profits. You set a stop order at .65 so you can still profit, but far enough away so that the volatility wont swing that far down unless it implies the stock's run has ended. 

If it reaches .8, you could set a new stop order for .7, and so on and so forth

In event of a MASS sell off, your stop order may not fill right away and you'll have to set a new one. Many people didn't get this filled today with UAVS because the stock was halted and immediately open 1.5 lower afterwards",2020-04-30

It's been getting tremendous play in terms of purchase orders (luxury goods or not), and has been expanding to keep up with said orders (even in this downturn). Its currently expected to exceed its revenue expectations by June/July of this year meaning it could end up making significantly more than expected for the year. Its also planning to expand into other countries this year. There is a lot of other things to like (too many to go through for this simple reply).

But it is not a quick flip Penny stock. 

Part of its recent downward trend likely has nothing to do with the company itself. Bigger investors are moving into positions, not out of positions.  I suspect its recent downward trend is because there are significant amounts of smaller-scale investors who play penny stocks for a QUICK buck and with BBRW gaining steam, many jumped on hoping for a quick shoot up but that is not the type of stock it is. It didn't ""go to the moon"" (it wasn't supposed to), and so they are selling off.

It's a good long term hold/investment (3-6 months minimum) for a fairly cheap price.",2020-04-30

For such a small risk, I decided to hold through the night. When it blew up this morning I got out at $3.66. Wish I had held to $5, obviously, but I'll take it.

Basically it was clear to me that irrational exuberance was taking over on ST, making a crazy positive feedback loop. Took my bad feeling and escaped with profit.

The risk was higher these companies would go bankrupt so it held down longer until a breaking point was reached. The relief of the stabilizing in oil prices was the catalyst. Look at this [overlay](https://imgur.com/s368mwE) with a larger more financially secure company in the same sector. The bigger company started reacting to the market rebound faster without bankruptcy looming. Notice where they are today, though - same level. 

My thoughts is that this will likely spike up and down but will settle down and flow more closely with the sector until earnings and other news drives the stock to perform better or worse.",2020-04-30
