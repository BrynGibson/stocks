1,$RYU $RYPPF RYU Apparel Short term break out predictions,egym0r,thatguybuddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/egym0r/ryu_ryppf_ryu_apparel_short_term_break_out/,2,10,"  

Just a quick look at this stock and the reason I continue to hold and accumulate shares. The shares have an average of 0.03 in the last three months. I don’t think it can have a breakout to 0.30 like in 2018 because of the increase of shares out there but I do believe I could see it going to 0.10-0.12 in the first Q of 2020

There are some key catalysts that have occurred in the last quarter of 2019 that I feel will show results in the first reports of 2020.

\- Elisabeth Rohm becoming a partner. [https://www.instagram.com/elisabethrohm/](https://www.instagram.com/elisabethrohm/) She has 228k followers and is hosting many RYU events in the L.A. area.

\- The Zappos store addition. [https://www.zappos.com/b/ryu/brand/5188](https://www.zappos.com/b/ryu/brand/5188)

\- The 40-50% sales in December that have many sizes and styles sold out.

Still lots of work to be done by the company. The addition of Elisabeth has given the social media boost that is expected yet. [https://www.instagram.com/ryu\_apparel/](https://www.instagram.com/ryu_apparel/) 39k to 40.6k since her partnering up. They also had a news release https://ceo.ca/@newswire/singer-and-songwriter-bryan-adams-wears-ryu-hero-item about Bryan Adams wearing Ryu in his new video that has 1.8 million views. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-eP8K6bhw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-eP8K6bhw) Unfortunately there is no shout out in the video info and no logo is seen in the video. 

2020 will be make or break for the company and the shareholders I feel. It will be exciting to see the overhaul of the product line up and what kind of buzz they can create in the first few months.",2019-12-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/egym0r/ryu_ryppf_ryu_apparel_short_term_break_out/
