6,IMTL news coming today,cl2xhg,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl2xhg/imtl_news_coming_today/,22,19,"    Morning folks, looks like today is big decision day for IMTL. The Fotofy launch news should be out any time today And we have seen accumulation anticipating this. Weâ€™ve had a nice run since first alert and now we have to decide what to hold and what to sell. I see value in a long term position but the unwritten rules of OTC say sell the news, and take profits. Iâ€™m still last minute building my strategy so I hope you guys have your own. 

     I canâ€™t help but think of Monster energy drinks. One of the inspirations for me playing pennyâ€™s. Somewhere along the line some guys bought at .11 and sold at .30 and made a nice paycheck. A few years later itâ€™s at 50.00. Iâ€™m sure they were happy they made money but dang look what they could have made. Haa. I think I have a little case of FOMO  :)

     Those are rare finds but I canâ€™t help but think IMTL has some hold potential. Anyhow. Rules is rules. Watch close today and good luck to all.",2019-08-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl2xhg/imtl_news_coming_today/
7,How can I take the next step forward?,cl2ipw,PopperChopper,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl2ipw/how_can_i_take_the_next_step_forward/,4,3,"So I have set up a brokerage account. I have bought and sold some stocks. I have joined a few communities. I have made a little bit and lost quite a bit more. Basically I have fooled around with a few grand to try and get the hang of things.

I'm looking for how to take the next step. I want to learn some more technical terms. I want to learn where to find stocks that are undervalued and I want to learn how I can tell for myself that they are undervalued. I have read a couple books and a lot of articles. But I am having a hard time trying to weed out what is bullshit and what isn't. 

I don't have a big pile of cash to put into this but I have a steady stream of income to put into it. I am ok to take risk since I am investing money that I'm free to part with. I have some stocks that I plan on being long on (for example the company that I work for) but I also don't mind doing a bit of day trading with some of it. But maybe not sit and watch all day kind of day trading. 

Apologies for any ignorance. Apologies for asking a repeated question. And many thanks for anyone who can help.",2019-08-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl2ipw/how_can_i_take_the_next_step_forward/

10,Undervalued Stock Picks,cl3l25,kismethavok,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl3l25/undervalued_stock_picks/,0,5,"No guarantee of any movement today or even next week on some of these, but each of them is currently undervalued IMO for various reasons.

MTLO.v - Fear and lack of news has caused it to drop down more than it probably should have, one good PR will send it back up. Do your DD and you won't mind holding for a bit.

TRQ - I've watched this mining stock drop when reality set in, then again from the same news coming out in their Q2. Project is too big to fail and minority shareholders of TRQ are protected from RIO so they can't fuck us. 

SCYX - With the current outbreak and spread of MDR Candida Auris this stock is going to be worth a fortune. Their new treatment seems promising (quoted from CDC) with the novel approach and in vitro and in vivo treatment options it will be an indispensable asset in dealing with C. Auris.",2019-08-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl3l25/undervalued_stock_picks/

but i cant find other good subs for this im sorry! every other sub i look at is much more dead than this!

so looking at HTZ i think it looks like it has potential? on the charts it has a pretty consistent spiking pattern, and looks like it is headed close to support or consolidation and soon will be headed back up. for a short term investment it looks like it could provide maybe 20% returns or more. volume over the past couple days has looked nice as well. just wondering if i am missing anything.

sorry again for wrong sub, but if someone knows a active sub that touches on this more i would welcome that knowledge (subs like r/swingtrade or r/swingtrading and similar subs are very slow to respond and have low activity)",2019-08-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cl9wnx/thoughts/
