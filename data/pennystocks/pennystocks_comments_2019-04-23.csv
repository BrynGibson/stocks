Notice the recent (timely) $25m offering which they say they ""don't have to"" exercise. It's all a scam.  Either that or the owner is completely delusional and has somehow wasted/poorly used god knows how many millions of dollars that have been funneled in already. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you believe otherwise, you believe that Hindenburg research (a reputable company afaik) is involved in a huge conspiracy. Of course, this has been public knowledge for MONTHS and the stock price has seen the recent run. So if you want to ride the wave and hope it spikes up again, go for it, but ffs take your money out before the value goes to true penny territory.",2019-04-23
1,Tongaduder,elk8jbg,/r/pennystocks/comments/bgbmf1/hindenburgs_research_on_yriv_debate/elk8jbg/,1,"The motion to dismiss was adjourned to the 15th. The actual trial will be on the 16th. During the discovery phase, the company will reveal its actual assets and available property rights. 

**Thoughts on $YRIV**

The Yangtze River is the main river the Chinese use for commercial transport. This company is located in the Wuhan region, which also is the geographical middle major cities such as HaErbin, WuLumuqui, and ShangHai. 

This company is legitimately established along the river, and they’ve acquired the property rights and licensing to begin developing major projects.

- 8 cargo ship docking spaces, capable of holding up ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 tons.

- Warehouse Container Zones

- Railroad loading zones that connect coastal China to mainland Europe.

Their goal is to complete three phases of logistics and development within 5 years.

**Key Points**

Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited is in a great position in multiple avenues.

**International Trade**

- There is finally reasonable expectation that the United States and China will resolve trade disputes and come to an agreement. The speculated time frame within 4 weeks time.

**Lawsuit**

- $YRIV would not have started such a heavy lawsuit against the Hindenburg unless they and their legal team were confident in $YRIV’s chances of winning. The particular language and wording they used is very aggressive.

- The motion to dismiss by the Hindenburg was adjourned to the 15th. The actual trial will be on the 16th. During the discovery phase, the company will reveal its actual assets and available property rights. 

**Insider Trading**

- The CEO himself has over **91 Million shares**

- 7 individual shareholders own **68.3 Million shares**

- The 7 shareholders also filed a class action lawsuit against the Hindenburg immediately after $YRIV filed theirs


**Summary**

During the lawsuit, $YRIV will be able to reveal its actual assets to the world and drive the Hindenburg to the ground.  Once shareholders regain confidence in the rest is history. Combine this with new international trade agreements and massive port development, we’ve got ourselves a sleeping giant.

Someone buying this company is possible but not probable and anyone who decides to invest had better be ready to lose every penny they put into it.",2019-04-23

89,Legend_of_Science,elmvlfd,/r/pennystocks/comments/bgfiu5/when_you_choose_a_penny_stock/elmvlfd/,1,"I look for news on otc markets because i want to avoid fishy, scammy stocks that can breakdown overnight.   
I also look at charts from various time periods, 1 year, all the way to 1 day to get a feel for traditional support and resistnaces.   
I check I hub and get public opinion and then...   
If I like the stock I will place it on a watchlist for a few days while i look up fillings.   
Look at what they sell and ask yourself if you think it has real potential.   
After I gain some confidence of the stocks price pattern, then i might make a move.   
But this only relates to stocks i want to day trade / swing trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are looking for a long term, dividend type of stock... or a sudden boomer, well you need to really see some news, and look at how the product they actually make is needed in society. If a business makes plastic spoons and has 1 factory and never plans to expand, then wtf are they doing in the market. I'll never buy it.   
Some new company thats making a new tech for government contracts, sounds more like it. 

  
last advice, do not listen to chatroom screeners. They make shit up and trick people into buying stocks AFTER they buy into them, then when they sell, they post for followers to sell, leaving people holding the bag. beware! be patient!",2019-04-23
