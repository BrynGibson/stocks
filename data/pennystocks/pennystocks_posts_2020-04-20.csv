15,$DFCO close Friday at a new 11 year high. Find me another OTC doing anything close to that.,g4jnuc,NormanMitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g4jnuc/dfco_close_friday_at_a_new_11_year_high_find_me/,1,15,"I've been a full time OTC trader since 2006 and my style of trading/investing is to find the few quality setups and trade them for longer term swing trades. A few months tend to be the longest I'll hold but if the play warrants it, I will adapt. Enter $DFCO.

I first stumbled upon $DFCO in January 2018 when it when from defunct to filing financials again with OTC Markets. That sparked the stock to run 1500% in a day (breaking out of a 9 year base) and then it began to consolidate it's gains. That consolidation was what first caught my eye. Most OTCs that run that hard get dumped hard soon after, so when I see a stock run like crazy AND hold it's gains, that means it's accumulation. And my style of trading is to follow the big boys and when they accumulate that heavily, so do I.

Fast forward to now and the once defunct company is making steady progress but it wasn't until this past week that the price action finally picked up again. Then on Thursday and Friday it made back to back new 11 year high closes, setting the stage for a continuation of that 2018 rally. This is mega long term play in action so I fully expect this to have legs. There will be volatility for sure, ups down and consolidation along the way, but I expect the uptrend to sustain itself for a long period of time. I always encourage traders to take some profits into strength to lock in some gains and limit overall risk at that stage, but then when a play has this sort of potential you need to let some run.

Best chart in the OTC by far right here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/K39erN3g/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K39erN3g/)

I've been singing it's praises for 2 years now and though the price has held up well, the lack of volume has kept the market uninterested. I kept telling people buy up the .03s and .04s while the volume was low because once volume picks up you're paying much higher. Oh well, I tried. Retail traders love to chase volume.. so here comes the volume.

This paper states that hospitalised Covid 19 patients had viral loads of between 9.9x10^2 (i.e 990) and 1.2*10^8 (i.e 120million) virus particles per ml of sample. 

Now this paper - upon which the alleged DECN tech is purported to be based - using clean virus samples in pure buffer, with background subtraction correction for the electrolytes, - can detect virus particles - (Not covid ones btw) - in the range of 10^11 (a hundred billion) to 10^14 ( a hundred thousand billion ) 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/ 

I would venture to suggest that if you are hospitalised with 100million vp/ml showing up in your system, you are quite likely long since dead by the time that you have a hundred billion of the things per ml in your system. 

10^11 is stated as the theoretical lowest detection limited of the described approach. The practical lowest detection limit will likely be higher still. 

That's before you've taken into account background effects from all the other gubbins that is present in a blood sample, not to mention the fact that the publsihed paper does not even cover Covid 19 and also states : 
Although some overlap is apparent between the three clusters of data points, the graph clearly shows that it is possible to distinguish between virus types on this basis, independent of their concentrations.It should be noted, however, that this investigation was performed for only these three viruses, and it would be premature to extrapolate the results to other virus types. 


These are good Scientists and this is a great paper. But what it is NOT is a description of a product that could be used to diagnose Covid 19 in whole blood samples at the point of care setting. 

The guys in the nice labs, all the fancy equipment and the Ph.Ds were only able to find them with impedance at 1000 times the high end of the concentrations they are at in hospitalsed patients. 

DECNs glucose meter with the impedance based hematocrit correction cannot and will not detect the Corona Virus 

At least 1000 times too insensitive to work",2020-04-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g4xgnx/decn_fud_or_valid_seen_on_decn_message_board/

110,$PCTL,g50htu,Geo81,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g50htu/pctl/,6,21,"Beautiful chart! Cup&amp;handle completing! Boom time!: 

And it is worth noting that tomorrow, Tuesday, will be the end of the 5th week of this consolidation pattern, which William J. O'Neil, publisher of Investor's Business Daily, and Owner of O'Neil &amp; Co, one of the top institutional research firms on Wall street, says in his books is the minimum duration of an ideal Cup &amp; Handle chart pattern. I mentioned this duration last week as something I would gladly wait for until the breakout occurs, and now we are there. Will it happen? Tomorrow, Wednesday, this week, very possibly! The way this chart looks, the 50dma and 200dma both now uptrending, all secondary indicators favorable, I wouldn't be surprised if this broke out tomorrow! But I suspect it will shortly regardless! 

And the timing from the fundamental side is fantastic, with much more news likely to be coming as we go forward, very positive news, in a host of areas, not just purchase orders, which will be among them. Fundamentals and technicals lining up together! Fantastic! 

This is the real deal, and the chart and timing are perfect for a major breakout and new uptrend beginning! 

And when it breaks out, I could easily see it running thru the key $.094 resistance and the nearby natural resistance at $.10, to begin the climb! If it does so on big volume, and then follows thru, that's the key final ingredient. And remember, the market invests on future value, to the greatest extent with strong growth companies, especially early in their growth, which is exactly what we have here, but in this case, with every reason to believe that growth not only will be accelerating, but will be going on for many years to come, globally! 

Long &amp; Strong! Into dollar land and beyond!
