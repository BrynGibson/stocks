No, this news is not already in the price.

 ***the subscription service that offers users the ability to see one¬†movie per day in theaters, announced in August of 2017 that they would be dropping their price from $45 per month to just $9.95 per month, it sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with interest in the company spiking¬†considerably. The company has rapidly grown¬†from 12,000¬†customers in August 2017 to over¬†3¬†million by June 2018, and the service is expecting to grow to over 5 million users by the end of the year.***

It's a tricky balance but you need to get better at spotting moves as they begin and never ever ever chase something that has already ran up a lot. I've been trading full time now for 13 years (almost) and have made every mistake in the book, it's how you learn. The key is to get experience in as cheaply as possible. Trust me you have a looooooong way to go so keep your tuition small at this point, ie only put in funny money like you did. It's a hell of a learning curve but if you survive the growing pains there's not many better ways to make money - it just takes a lot of pain to figure out what the hell you're doing.",2018-10-04

- You are admittedly new, why do you think someone brand new just found some hidden gem?

62,NormanMitis,e763x1m,/r/pennystocks/comments/9ld4dm/terrible_start_with_penny_stocks_i_did_everything/e763x1m/,1,"I've been a full time trader for nearly 13 years. I wasn't profitable until maybe my second or third year and even after then I had major bumps along the way. IMO if you want to do this for a living, expect to put in 5 - 10 years of training at it. That's your college education and your tuition is all of your losses. When you first start out you better not be dependent on trading to pay the bills, either you need to have another job or live at your parents or something. You'll have successes along the way but being consistently profitable over a long period of time is not easy and takes time. Look at all of your losses as learning tools, otherwise you will quit from rage and frustration. Trading is a skill to hone and refine over time, every minute of screen time and every trade is just more experience. If you don't make any money for years but are learning the ropes, you're making progress. There's a reason why so few people trade for a living and it's because the learning curve is so steep and no one wants to earn it. They want quick money, then get their ass kicked, then give up because they don't see the big picture. Trading is the toughest thing I've ever done. To succeed at it means you've made countless mistakes so embrace them and move on from them. I mean years and years of making mistakes.

As for what I look for, I am a chart trader. I look for charts that I believe are showing signs of strength and look to be setting up to breakout, but they also haven't ran too much. I can't tell you exactly what to look for because so much of it is only in how I see it. If you follow stocks daily and watch them move up and down, back and forth etc you will start to learn what things to look for. This only happens after years and years of watching and following stocks. As you see more breakouts, breakdowns, failed moves, successful moves etc you begin to see patterns and signs that you can apply moving forward. In my years of trading I've had countless times where I thought I 'got it' and understood it all, only to realize that I had a long ways to go. If you are serious about trading, get ready for a long path of learning through trial and error.

Nothing will beat screen time and following stocks and trading, then learning from your trades. I've read tons of books and none of them helped me very much. I learned everything from firsthand experience. It's like learning a foreign language. At first everything will seem like jibberish but eventually you will be fluent. Charts are great because they reflect exactly what the market has been doing. Users on message boards are mostly noobs and/or trying to pump up their positions and I highly recommend to take everything you read with a grain of salt. In my first few months of trading I would trade based on what I read on forums. Then I lost my ass and realized I needed to trade charts because those didn't lie. They're not magic but they are tools that help you to sway the odds in your favor, but ONLY once you've gotten good at reading them (and that takes TIME). You'll hear people say that charts don't work or charts don't work on penny stocks. They're fools who simply never put in the time to learn to use them. If charts didn't work then I wouldn't be trading for a living after 13 years. It's not easy but imo charts are the only way I'm able to make it as a trader. And of course I'm still learning. I'll always be learning, this is an incredibly tough gig and will make you humble, yet it's possible to have some wild success if you stick with it. Toughest thing I've ever done but at the same time the most rewarding.",2018-10-04

The moment you feel the panic of FOMO, that is a clear sign that you are not investing with your brain. There will always be some new hype train to jump into. If you do proper research into a stock or field of stocks, and you deem there to be value in something, than add it to you watch list and wait for the price to dip, buy in and leave it alone to mature. Unless you are managing a hedge fund, you can simply not wield enough power to make day trading worth while. Someone investing $1 million USD, only needs the stock to move up/down 1 point to make a cool $10,000. Meanwhile your $150 investment needs to move up or down 7000% to make the same return. You're better buying a lottery ticket. If you want to double your money, buy and hold shares in companies that you believe will be  profitable long term. Invest in fields that you know about personally.

They also bought exclusive partnership rights and partial ownership of TokeIt Technologies.  They develop an app that services dispensaries/clients for use of the medical cannabis; part of Parcel Pal's acquisition gave them right to the source code of the app.  I'm not in finance, but I am a developer.  


Purchasing source code that is already in production will save them an enormous amount of time and resources... which really translates into money.  As partial owner of the company, it means they'll most likely acquire the use of one, or two, developers that are already familiar with the TokeIt source code; that means there won't be a training curve.

I think it will be a while, but I'm willing to wait.
