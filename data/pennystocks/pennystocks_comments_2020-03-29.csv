People seem to enjoy my posts and want to see what I think of their stock picks. In fact, I've gotten over 20 PMs in the past week asking about their stock picks.

It was an award given to me by the people on here. I'm happy to have the honor, it means a lot to me. Although trading well is more important.

I get biotech is different and all that but the company themselves said (even after the stock issue netted them 48.4 million) that "" Our long-term liquidity depends upon our ability to grow our commercial programs, expand our commercial operations at the Boca Facility, improve our supply-chain capabilities, improve production yields, provide more control and visibility for timing of commercial product releases, raise additional capital, fund and successfully implement our research and development and commercial programs, establish and build out a commercial sales force, medical affairs organization and commercial infrastructure and meet our ongoing obligations."" So they were reliant on supply chain and labor. They just got Corona'd. So I'd pass.

DL: China has more room to fall as their second wave is already starting again. If holding long term looks solid.

TTOO: I think there have been a hundred posts on TTO on this sub the last week, you can compare them for yourself.

ATYU: The news of their approval for testing has already passed so the big gains have been missed. They can still climb significantly if COVID slows down and people are ok with profiting off the tests and treatment again as they'd be making plenty.

OPK: Google trends and TA say that run has gone. Would basically be waiting on a news pump which isn't impossible.

MFA: The housing bubble is about to pop again and an overleveraged REIT dealing in real-estate ETFs is up 90%? I have no fucking idea but I wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole

MPC: If you think oil will rebound overall, go for it. Otherwise nothing special stands out to help them not shit the bed like their whole industry has been.

For example, in the biotech/pharma sector, you can benefit from increasing prices in anticipation of catalysts such as PDUFA and ADCOM. Ahead of such events, investors tend to price in good news (e.g. an FDA approval or a vote for during an ADCOM meeting). 
Another example is with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, it was relatively easier to spot which companies would release news pertaining to them either working to develop treatments or test kits. All you needed to do was to look up companies that worked on infectious diseases or made test kits/diagnostics and then buy their stock on reasonable support levels in anticipation of a PR. And nearly all of them released a PR, from which you then profited on.

The oil war is a lot of turmoil and drop in oil price shares but once it blows over oil companies will be right back on top.

Again to everyone else looking at this stock, be seriously careful. It's been kept afloat by a bunch of idiots who somehow give the WSB lads a run for their money without realizing the big fish are using it to laugh their way to the bank.  

For every 1 meaningful post about AYTU, you have 9 idiots only asking ""When is it going to go up?!"" like we all have some crystal ball that we're choosing to not share with others.

Things that are known about this company:

1) Everyone was saying, ""Just wait for FDA approval and then to the moon!"". That moment came and the stock saw a jump to \~$2.15 (not even the 52 week high) and then fell back down

2) Everyone is now saying ""Just wait for the kits to start selling and then to the moon!"".  Multiple other players, including the 130 billion (you know, vs the 100 mil company that is AYTU) giant ABT, have now entered the same game. AYTU isn't even producing their own kits but getting them from a distributer in Hong Kong.  

If you're going to jump in, wait for a dip (lower than 1.60) and sell high (anything over 1.90).

Hopefully I'm wrong and they succeed.  More kits in the world is a good thing to get us all through this crisis. I just highly doubt they're going much higher any time soon.",2020-03-29

I’m New to trading, no knowledge on stocks, so reader beware. 

But im worrying if it is already priced in? (Not the XSPA part)

500k a week is 5 million in profit (assuming 10$ profit each test) 

If I am not wrong, there is 78 million shares, so it’s 6 cents profit per share per week. 

If we are able to import for 2 months now it is 48 cents profit 
Let’s say they import for another 3 months in fall, it will only be a total 1.2$ profit 

Given the initial PPS of 35 cents, if this 1.2$ profit is added to the price it will be 1.55 
Not sure if this how PPS will be calculated
Does it mean it’s already priced in? 

In my speculation I assumed 5 months of imports at a rate of 500k per week (10 million total tests at 10$ profit). Which may or may not happen. 

So only if it happens, the PPS will be valued at 1.55. Again by next fall we will have huge competition. So there might not be 10$ profit margins. 

And unless there is a requirement of mass serology tests for everyone before they could go to work as we are seeing  some articles about it (in which we have a decent market share) or if aytu does some successful partnerships with XSPA which would generate continual revenue, and more business from other aytus products we may not go to the moon. 

Well we might get FDA approval like CODX just did, and our tests may be sold on amazon for at home testing. But I’m not sure if that would be allowed by the government in the near future as they want to know about the count of positive cases.

I might have talked just shit and may not make sense. 

All I wanted to hear from you is, if we already seem priced in just based on current business model of distribution rights of tests to authorities.",2020-03-29

417,TubbyAnemia,ft9l4z5,/r/pennystocks/comments/fr8r5t/list_of_everything_you_need_for_stock_trading/ft9l4z5/,1,Love all this information. It's a lot to take in and with all the different Indicators it can be confusing on what exactly they are showing. Do you have a discord or now of one where people can ask questions or just discuss stuff to actually learn to trade and not just yolo when someone puts 1000 rocket ships in a post?,2020-03-29
418,Thatguyfromdeadpool,ft9mewl,/r/pennystocks/comments/fr8r5t/list_of_everything_you_need_for_stock_trading/ft9mewl/,1,"I do provide my services to quite a few paid groups and give teaching lessons sometimes, however I will not and have not promoted them because that would be against the rules of the subreddit( I won't even tell in a PM)

However there are a few Free groups that have some decent people where you'll be able to learn and they have free resources.

Atlas: Which has a great Resource Section(Scroll down to Education Section in the group)
https://discord.gg/atlastrading

Noremac Newell: Another Free Group with some nice information and videos.

Since the majority of everyday traders are not privileged to the info in advance the spike usually happens after. Take GNUS for example, it spiked on 7/2/20 right after the press on the conference call was released that day.",2020-03-29
