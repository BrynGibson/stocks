Technical/quantitative analysis provides a rational approach which can be helpful in overcoming doubt during such times.

Stocks have been overvalued for sometime now. Pure value investors should have exited markets way back (say 2017/18) because of such high valuations. It is in such times of uncertainty that technical analysis delivers an significant advantage.

Take a look at Alpha portfolios as an example - they stop out when markets are crashing (risk-off) and re-allocate when markets turn bullish (risk-on).

Unlike the spy or aapl etc which might drop $10-15+ your sub 5$ stock might drop 1$ or 2$ typically. So yeah sub 5$ typically aren't worth trying to short as your profits are capped way more than a mid to large cap stock would be. 

Also microcaps typically don't hsve the options volume that would typically prevent you from getting stuck on a play. Unless your buying 1 or 2 contracts inwhich case until your buying way more contracts per play it probably won't effect you as much. Go and buy 1000 contracts or so and see if you can drop them all ITM. Odds are youll get caught holding your dick in your hand. 

Not everyone who posts on here trade small positions. And fyi no investor who has a shred of decency or capabilities is going to suggest continously doing puts on microcap stocks. The risk vs reward is just not there.",2020-01-27
