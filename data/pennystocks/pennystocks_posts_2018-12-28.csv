1,BYSD Bayside Blockchain Corp,aabmtc,getoffmylawn13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aabmtc/bysd_bayside_blockchain_corp/,1,2,"Company has been fairly quiet lately. They have a partnership with chainbytes for Florida BTMs and from what I have seen, have not had any dilution of OS since April. They have filed for a massive 1:15,000 reverse split recently that should go into effect very soon if Finra approves. Currently valued around $500,000 market cap. I am long on this right now despite the reverse split. I believe they will be very interesting to watch in 2019 and after the reverse split especially. I wish I went long so I can buy at the lower prices but oh well. Anybody watching this or other crypto plays for 2019?

7,CNSX:IDK Bids stacking nicely,aa5cq7,daunted49,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aa5cq7/cnsxidk_bids_stacking_nicely/,1,1,"http://threedcap.com

A few catalysts going into Q1 here: 
- Goldspot going public (DUKE:TSXV)
- New found goldcorp going public (DMR:TSXV)

Many other holdings to like as well. 

Some parts of the portfolio I don't necessarily like, but the gold/mining assets out weight them in IDK's portfolio. 

Level 2 bid/ask spread is extremely thin to the upside, and stacking LARGE to the bid side. 

Pretty bullish going into Q1 !!! 

DYODD :) Cheers and good luck out in the markets, looking rough ",2018-12-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aa5cq7/cnsxidk_bids_stacking_nicely/

BUT WHY AND WHAT IS G5?,aacmoh,louied91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aacmoh/srmx_tri_cascade_is_building_the_g5_system_but/,1,0,"[https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/dns/news/document/34380/content](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/dns/news/document/34380/content)

**Commentary from CEO, Max Li:**

G5 is a 15.6‚Äù touch screen *Self-Internet IoT A.I. Cluster Domain Embedded Computer System.* It is far beyond a regular computer that we are using today.

&amp;#x200B;

Running a true **Smart House** is not simply installing a one-off smart thermostat or using a one-off IP cam doorbell with mobile app access. Just because you have a few ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices doesn‚Äôt mean that your house itself is smart. The future of the building industry will be to construct an entire **Smart Community** consisting of true Smart Houses to advance our future life and safety.

I believe the future Smart House should be operate through the umbrella of a sophisticated IoT computer system, with a *self-independent Internet* and a *local M2M* network - I call this *‚ÄúIndependent IoT‚Äù ‚Äì* already installed for

the homeowner to use. We will be able to control the house with our voice commands. It will have its own ‚Äúbrain‚Äù, **and G5 is the brain of the house**.

I selected Microsoft as the Tri Cascade A.I. development partner because I know, for sure, that Microsoft is the most capable resource in this direction. There will be 2 different (but integrated) A.I. mechanism systems in G5. Facial Recognition (vision A.I.) and Speech (voice)Recognition. For Smart House development we simply define theses two A.I. functions as basic G5 features to run the smart house at the outset, when first constructed. We do not anticipate embedding A.I. features in the aftermarket to convert a‚Äúnon-smart house‚Äù into a ‚Äúsmart house‚Äù.

**Here are the preview technical specs. of the Tri Cascade G5 system:**

* \- ¬†15.6‚Äù (1366x768) Digital TFT Smart A.I. Thermostat
* \- ¬†Resistive and Projected Capacitive touch screen
* \- ¬†Windows 10 IoT platform with Intelligent Edge
* \- ¬†Microsoft vision A.I. Facial/Voice Speech Recognition
* \- ¬†Intel¬Æ Apollo Lake Celeron¬Æ N3350 SOC, DDRR3L 16GB
* \- ¬†Intel¬Æ MovidiusTM MyriadTM VPU
* \- ¬†SSD 256/512G Edge storage capacity
* \- ¬†Fan-less design form-factor
* \- ¬†LTE/NB IoT Self-Internet connectivity
* \- ¬†802.11n M2M EasyMesh wireless network (with an upgrade to  
Microsoft Azure Sphere in late 2019)
