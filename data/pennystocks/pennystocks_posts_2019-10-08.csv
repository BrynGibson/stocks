4,Why investing in large caps is for fools,df23o0,hermanhugh666,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/df23o0/why_investing_in_large_caps_is_for_fools/,0,5," Investing in large cap stocks is completely asinine, total tomfoolery and the function of irrational. Harsh, I know, but I stand behind those words – and let’s be honest for a minute – **investing in large cap stocks is one of the most irrational and illogical moves a small-time investor can do.**

If you are a retail investor – or even a fund manager with under one billion in assets under management – you are playing a fool’s game investing in large cap stocks. It makes zero sense to swim with the big dogs. You will have no advantage in large cap land. In large cap land, you are a one-legged man in an ass kicking contest. **You’re going to get your ass kicked and you won’t be able to do anything about it!**

As a small-time investor, you have zero informational advantage researching and investing in large caps. Large caps are complex. Large caps are for smart money. You are not smart money. You are dumb money.

Large caps typically have several business segments. **Are you going to tell me you can efficiently model out and understand seven different business segments better than the hundreds of other analysts covering Apple, Google or General Electric?** There is no way you can! You don’t have a million-dollar research budget. You can’t travel to every business segment General Electric owns. You can’t understand the business in-depth enough to make an intelligent decision. You are a brainwashed monkey if you think you can.

Any investment into a large cap by a small-time investor is pure speculative. The function of a successful investor is being partner in a portion of a business. If you can’t understand every single segment of General Electric, you are not being an investor or a businessman, you are being a speculative gambler.

If you are managing pennies (in this context anything under one billion) there is no sense researching a large cap. You will never have an informational advantage. There will be hundreds of analysts that know 100x more than you ever will about that company. Give up on the large cap research. It’s a fool’s game.

Another reason to drop the large cap investing is the lack of access to upper management. Do you think the CEO of Apple will ever want to talk to you? [Dream on Ponyboy](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-some-ponyboys-dreams-goals-outsiders-659948). Researching and investing in small and micro-cap securities will allow you access to upper management 90% of the time. Large caps, not so much.

Speaking to management of a company will give you an informational advantage. Furthermore, its likely you can get a tour of the asset you are bullish on in person. Think of all the information you can gather from a company tour! You won’t find that kind of research in large cap land as a small fry.

What’s worse than lack of access to management is the lack of returns. Large caps don’t even produce the best returns! [Small and microcap stocks produce the most superior returns out there](http://www.perrittcap.com/the-micro-cap-advantage-how-microcap-equities-help-enhance-return-and-lower-correlation-in-client-portfolios/). Why would you stick your money in an asset class that has historically returned sub-par returns relative to their smaller counterparts? Are you high? **Oh, I know, you probably just think volatility is a function of risk. That’s right, you went to business school, didn’t you?**

Seriously though, the smaller the company, the better the returns – based on a back-tested historical basis. It will be extremely difficult producing alpha in large caps. I would rather stick with a back-tested methodology and have statistics on my side in small and micro-cap land.

And let’s get this straight – I didn’t go to business school and I don’t believe in the efficient market theory. But I do believe the market is efficient 99% of the time. The market is smart. The market is filled with geniuses who sit at their computers every day making cold calculated decisions on asset valuations. The market is almost always right – especially in large cap land.

However, in the small and micro-cap fields the market is less efficient. The lack of sheer liquidity can produce pockets of inefficiency that the well-informed researcher can take advantage of. Information is not as wildly disseminated within the smaller companies of the market. I have taken advantage of public information others were not aware about in the micro-cap space in the past. If I was investing in large caps this would be much harder to do.

So why are you still investing in large caps? I would love to hear your rationale on why a large cap strategy makes sense for your penny pocket portfolio. Comment below. Let’s start a debate. I want to hear your convincing argument that investing in large caps makes sense. Because right now, all I see is a abuncha fools blindly dropping dollars in a losing man’s game",2019-10-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/df23o0/why_investing_in_large_caps_is_for_fools/

7,Why you should always build a DCF Model,df1h4o,hermanhugh666,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/df1h4o/why_you_should_always_build_a_dcf_model/,0,5,"[Within the investing community](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/04/lottery-winner-arrested-after-releasing-145987-snakes-at-his-former-work/) there is a lot of hate for DCF models. Many say there are too many inputs – leaving the investor an output that is unpredictable and inherently false. Others say there is too much uncertainly embedded into a model that they are, basically, a waste of time. Finally, and this is my opinion, people are lazy and resort to a simpler method of analyzing the future value of an asset such as a multiple expansion approach.

While I wholly agree that your model is likely to be wrong 99% of the time, I believe that DCF models are a valuable tool for a research analyst. And let me take a minute to be honest. [When I first started as an amateur investor](https://ad-venturing.com/about-reader-beware/), I completely ignored DCF models – resorting to a much simpler valuation approach such as multiple expansion or relative valuation. However, as I have progressed as a researcher, I now use a DCF approach for any asset that I am valuing.

So, what is so good about a DCF model? Well first they make you [think like a businessman](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/06/hedge-fund-manager-finds-new-tax-loophole-to-steal-money-from-the-poor/). DCF models are complex and make you think outside of the typical relative multiple expansion approach; example, “Oh Apple is trading at 10x EV/EBIT and Google is trading at 15x EV/EBIT, so that means Apple has 50% upside based on a relative expansion to Google’s 15x”.

**Using a relative multiple expansion is an amateur or purely lazy way to defend the valuation of an asset** you are analyzing. A DCF model on the other hand is not only more [professional but makes for a better valuation case](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/05/man-starts-hedge-fund-cant-find-anything-to-hedge/) – and allows the researcher to think outside of the box.

For an example, when you are building a DCF model a few inputs into the DCF are capex, depreciation and working capital. Blindly putting random numbers into the three former inputs is the basis of garbage in, garbage out. To not allow the garbage in, garbage out mindset to take hold, you need to intuitively [think like a businessman on what the specific asset you are analyzing](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/05/hedge-fund-manager-admits-he-has-no-idea-what-he-is-doing/) will need going forward in terms of capex, depreciation and working capital.

It’s tough to do. If you are analyzing a cement company for example, how will you know what capex rate they will have for the next year, or even 5 years out? How are you going to know if they are planning to ramp up on a big project for future growth? How will you know what your inputs will be?

To know these inputs, you are forced to think like you are the owner of that specific asset that you are analyzing. If you were the man in charge of the cement company, how much would you spend in capex per year? How would you measure D&amp;A after a $25 million capex spend? How much working capital will you need per every $100 million in revenues? I’m not sure of those answers. [But if I were to buy shares in a cement company](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/03/why-is-investing-in-large-caps-is-for-fools/) I would want to have some well thought out, well researched answer to those questions. **There is no way I would dump 10% of my wealth in a company if I didn’t know an educated guess to those answers.**

Even better, when you are building a DCF model and do not know how much an asset will need in capex per year, this directs the course of your call with management in a more quantitative approach – **building a DCF model forces you to ask the right questions!**

[I think a lot of investors don’t ask the right questions on a management call](https://ad-venturing.com/2019/10/07/how-much-cash-should-i-have-during-a-recession/). It’s tricky knowing what to ask in a 30 minute to 1-hour call. I have found the best way to maximize your time and managements time is to know the right questions to ask. Building a DCF model will help with preparing these questions. If you are modeling a lemon farm and not sure what the cost to plant one acre is, ask management.

Finally building a DCF model is more professional and allows you to not rely on [amateur valuation methods such as relative valuation and multiple expansion.](https://ad-venturing.com/2018/06/29/stocks-are-doomed/) The irony of using multiples is simple. Multiples are a simplified version of a DCF – they are everything that is in a DCF but put into a simple multiple for lazy investors. The only way to properly value a business is through its future cash flows discounted at certain rate. Using a relative approach doesn’t allow deep thinking into cash flows and disregards all fundamental drivers of a business. And what’s worse, multiple valuation is used by the majority of investors to value a business. Maybe this is why the majority of investors have average returns?

If you are currently not using a DCF approach to your valuation process, [I highly suggest you change your method of valuation](https://ad-venturing.com/2018/06/22/inflation-filled-anxiety/). A DCF allows you to think like a businessman a DCF forces you to think deeply into the economic drivers of a business’s cash flow, and a DCF is much more professional than a relative or multiple expansion approach. DCF’s are tricky and your model will not be accurate. However, building a DCF model for every asset you analyze will improve your valuation skills and take you to the next level of professionalism in investing.",2019-10-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/df1h4o/why_you_should_always_build_a_dcf_model/
