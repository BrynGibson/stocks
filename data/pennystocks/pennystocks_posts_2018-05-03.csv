Reminds me exactly of EQLB which bit me hard then proceeded to run 400% since. Panic on good news and recovering. Always a very steady morning rise for 30 minutes into open then who knows what happens and made profit the last overnight. I wouldn't be too scared to long it but everyone can make their own decision. 

AXXA finally got the much needed correction. The best part is that the Tim Sykes crew is alerted to it now so we have a huge influx of volume to it. He ended up buying it and as a result we now have many millions of dollars traded today of it. I think we see a morning spike for sure on it. Then it gets risky. 

UHLN is a fun one like BIEL. Panic then climbed 100% from its lows. Is expecting news soon also but who knows when that will come. Is a risky pick for sure but could pay. Watch into close. May not give a good window. ",2018-05-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gsvx4/overnight_plays_for_53_biel_axxa_uhln/
