Since then they‚Äôve been developing a COVID-19 vaccine, submitted a request for human trials to the FDA, and were awarded the trial. If I am not mistaken they have trials going on in both South Korea and the United States, so it could be growing in optimism of a treatment. As it stands today, their stock has jumped over 113% year to date. They do have a lawsuit looming over their heads, and I‚Äôd expect their stock to dip a bit before it rises. If I were you, I‚Äôd wait for that dip if I was planning on buying in.

Make your goals really tight and you won't feel like you failed to meet it if you can get close. Have enough buying power balanced across two days to aim for small daily profits of like 1 to 2% at a time the first month. It seems silly small but for every home run you attempt you could also strike out the same amount. Even just a $5-10 a day can add up quickly when you start out. Then as you gain confidence in reading green plays, you'll see your goal gets met 3 out of 5 days and your green each week. Aim to be green on the week but don't worry if you are red. It happens. Don't jump on every trade. If you are unsure, skip the day or cut back on your buying power you want to risk.

Today for example, I had $550 ish buying power which is only a portion of my account now. The rest comes back tomorrow and it cycles every other day. I don't hold much cause its money you can use to make a better trade with. I was debating between puttin all of it into NBY or CYCC and if I put it all into one or the other it would have been a 50 50 chance of success or failure. I ended up buying 200 shares with half my buying power into NBY and ended up stopping out later than I should have thinking it would bounce back and suffered a $40 loss. If I put in everything it would have been really bad. So instead I was able to buy $175 or 15 shares of CYCC later hoping to at least get half of my losses back. Trailing order back a $1 when it hit at least the P/L i wanted and let it go. It ended up getting more for a $54 profit. Balanced the day out although the FOMO of not just picking CYCC from the beginning will always be around. FOMO is just the way of day traders so accept it as fact. Tomorrow I'll have another chunk of buying power instead of waiting two days to get all of it back so I can work at it again and maybe learn why one trade worked and not the other.",2020-04-20

My suggestion is picking a couple stocks that are undervalued and have consistent returns that are above 20 dollars. And holding that position for a duration of a year.
