They keep signing deals left and right for distribution contracts.  They have added 16 states in the last few months.   Today they announced a new warehouse facility in South Carolina, as their production is now outgrowing their Florida HQ.  The new location will also save enough money on shipping that theyll be able to pay for the lease.   

I think the biggest concern for me is the float.  Lots and lots of shares out there.  The CEO has mentioned theyd like to move up in the otc to be listed on NYSE, so theyll at least have to be up over $1 to do that.   I think the only way its reasonable is a reverse split, but that's not neccesarily a bad thing.   

They seem to not be a fly by night company, unlike some other penny stocks in the cbd/hemp/mj industry.  They have actual products that they're actually selling (I ordered some to be sure LOL), they're signing on sponsorships and advertising, racking up distributors etc.   2019 is going to be a big year for them.   Honestly I think it has the potential to be a huge player.  It's a tough business to get in, a tough market to get product on the shelves.   theyll likely have to sell at least distribution rights to a bigger player, but a buyout could be really good for shareholders.",2019-05-17

I have a question that pertains to one of the oft quoted downsides of penny stocks, which is their liquidity. 

If you bought a penny stock when its price was starting to increase and you wanted to sell it while it was still increasing, would liquidity generally be an issue or is it mostly a problem when the price of the stock is decreasing (or staying stationery)??  What factors would affect liquidity (such as the number or percentage of shares you hold)? And under what conditions would you say being able to sell the stock would be very high?",2019-05-17
