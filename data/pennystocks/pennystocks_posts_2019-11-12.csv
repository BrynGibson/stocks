Just a little research and a little intuition, with a little dash of salt.",dvi3bp,Stockbaron,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dvi3bp/fbio_and_nexcf_are_about_to_blow_like_a_violent/,1,7,"I talk and work with a lot of investors, very different types of investors but they all like to do some simple day trading stuff. Just a heads up, I keep hearing these two tickers as if they might be the next messiah or comparable. I don’t own either one yet, but I do find NEXCF to be a very, very attractive play to ride that stock out of penny land. It’s almost guaranteed as it is the newest tech on the market(AR tech) and this company is in the thick of it. They are getting noticed a lot. FBIO, still doing a little DD there. Any thoughts?",2019-11-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dvi3bp/fbio_and_nexcf_are_about_to_blow_like_a_violent/

8,Do you ever question why algorithms always beat human trading? There is no correct answer but it is an interesting subject to evaluate.,dveol3,MyTiker,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dveol3/do_you_ever_question_why_algorithms_always_beat/,1,0," 

**MyTiker believes the most significant aspect is lacking emotion.**

Algorithms make decisions based on that of statistical and analytical calculations, based on numerous factors, all at once, determining a probability of an outcome in milliseconds. It then generates a statistically correct plan for profitability based on the account factors and sticks to the plan. It either turns out successful or unsuccessful. The algorithm doesn't care what happens, it knows it made the statistically correct decision and with the right sample size (amount of trades) it will discover predictable profitability which then rinses and repeats.

&amp;#x200B;

**Humans have an innate desire for winning.** 

When placed in situations where we must sacrifice (money and time) to win (grow our wealth and person) we seem to freeze and develop this ignorance to mistakes and decisions we have made. During this freeze, we let the security go right through our stop loss while we sit there cursing the sky when in truth it had nothing to do with the sky, we took a position with an idea of an outcome, and it turned out we were WRONG. We end up taking the loss .50c below/above our stop loss and as soon as we are out the stock rockets back to our entry. We slam our computer down and throw our hands in the air. We then return 2-hours later to look at the security we were trading and hope it has dropped or popped because we are selfish and don't want others making money because we lost our money. We believe 95% of traders have experienced this exact moment on numerous occasions. It's all part of the process. First, understand and notice this experience and second eliminate the experience from happening again. Algorithms never experience this situation.

There is a saying by Albert Einstein stating **""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.""** Develop an algorithmic mindset. Explore your options. Don't get caught up in one moment or trade. Find what works for you and build upon it. Track your progress. Journalize your adventure. Most importantly, enjoy the opportunity. Think of the amount of time and lives that were invested to make trading possible. You are blessed and highly favored for knowing that trading exists.

***If you experience this, know that you have just discovered what is holding you back and you must take the time and energy to change the programming of your emotions or stop trading now. Save your money and save your time. You MUST reprogram this innate emotional tie to winning.***  

The first step to finding an edge in the market is to first understand the business you are in and second to develop the mindset and emotional discipline to manage the business you are in.  Understand trading first, then develop yourself to correlate directly with the security trading you desire.  There are securities for everyone and every emotional and financial situation.
