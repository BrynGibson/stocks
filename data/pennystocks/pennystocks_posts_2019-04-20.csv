Spending the same amount of money without spending for a whole with premium price. And you can make money off stock losses too
(i have never read into options until last week out of the 1 1/2 years, but been reading like twice a day since)

On top of staring at charts and watching press releases the past year and recognising stock price average+/- on most bigger stocks, i think I'd feel comfortable making call/puts

Im going to watch some live trades this week for further knowledge to get an understanding, and  going to start after i actually know what im doing. Probably next month or so. 

You guys should really look into it. Its literally a steal.",2019-04-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bf6kw2/so_i_might_be_switching_half_my_equity_to_options/
