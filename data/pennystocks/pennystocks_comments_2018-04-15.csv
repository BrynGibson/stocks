I don't follow fashion, I'm a dude, but from the website I only saw a couple of items that I thought looked pretty. The first thing that showed up was a blouse that was a deeper shade of lime green with pirate ruffles down the front. It looked lame. The site itself looked pretty functional. So I did a google search by item for the first thing that popped up in their line up (it wasn't the pirate shirt, it was some Joseph A cardigan). The item was one of two that showed up on the first page of the search in white. Along side of it was the black variation offered by Nordstrom rack for a couple of bucks less. I also read the Wikipedia article. Apparently this is a well established discount retailer. However it appears that they have had some financial difficulties over the past few years. My suggestion would be to take this post over to
 r/securityanalyisis If you plan on a substantial investment. That being said, Personally I would not bet on this company. I should also mention that I assumed that they sold beer mugs by the name alone, but their ticker is off the hook!",2018-04-15

Looks to still be operating at a loss. Not much of a change from the last filing. Needing help with shares issued. Am I correct in reading that 11 million shares were added to raise money? Pure swing play for me. ",2018-04-15
