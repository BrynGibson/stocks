You got to think that a few months ago 5,000 would buy you 10,000,0000 shares. When those guys see .015 to .02 they are gonna dump a pile of shares. So any fast growing stock that started in the super sub penny‚Äôs will have some corrections due to this. 
    The time between press releases will be crucial to how low the dips get Also. There are many variables to consider but once you get some experience and see this same thing unfold a few times you will start to have a better understanding to what is happening when the chart is moving up and down. I do anticipate some dips but the trend, in my opinion, will be upward.",2019-07-13

The last big runner I found was SHMP. I banked there and am holding a pile of shares.

You also have to ask if you'd be able to exit at 2.4 and I don't think that's possible.
