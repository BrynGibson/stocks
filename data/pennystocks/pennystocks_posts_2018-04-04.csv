Why I'm interested.

i) Liabilities to Assets is good.
ii) Revenue Stream - Actual Stores, I recently visited one in Toronto, Ontario and while the quality of clothing is excellent, most significant problem is inventory, can't get enough!  Very high quality and busy.
iii) Appears to be opening stores in trendy Brooklyn, NY, Venice, Beach and Newport Beach.  Careers page filled with positions.
iv) CEO wants to expand to 1,000,000 RYU members by 2020, and also, on my visit heard 150 stores in N.A. by 2025.
v) Women's magazines love their pants over Lululemon $LULU since they offer a ""TriLayr™ waistband uses layered compression construction that wraps around the waistband."" which prevents riding, and unlike Lululemon, they offer ""Go Commando. Bacteriostatic carbon mesh lined diamond gusset."" which is prevents a cameltoe which the women's magazines love.
vi) Lululemon is quoted in other magazines as being a tired brand since it been popular for over ten years and everyone has it.  They like that $RYU for high quality, and that it's not marketed to yoga crowd, rather Urban Athlete. 
vii) Bieber Group invested $$ in February 2018.
viii) When I research Lululemon competitors only Nike and Adidas come up.  But this must be based on sales and some athletic comparison.  While I don't shop at Lulu, I know many women who have, and it's not a fair comparison.  RYU is offering similar competition in that their stores offer classes and get-togethers, i.e. a culture.  

Anyway, I have a position, curious on your thoughts.  Earnings report will be telling, but I expect the signs of expansion to be held within.",2018-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/89syy1/ryuv_respect_your_universe/

&gt; Q: When is the latest quarter earnings released? Robin hood I'm told says today, but I know it's changed many times? Number I can call into to hear the call? Thanks

-

&gt; A: Hi ~~Name~~. As announced in the post above, earnings are in April. We have never given a specific date and we apologize for the confusion caused by third parties such as Robinhood. We ask that investors not rely on third parties and instead turn to the company website, press releases, and social media posts for reliable and up-to-date information.

-

&gt; Follow Up Q: Would it be ok to maybe post on your page when it's going to happen when you know? I would love to be a part of the call. Glad to see the stock going up today I think more good is to come!

-

&gt; A: **To clarify, last year we adjusted earnings communications to no longer hold quarterly earnings calls**, given the stage and size of the company. Instead, we simply **issue an earnings press release** of financial results along with the issuance of the quarterly 10Q or 10K. Corporate updates continue to be shared in the form of press releases, social media posts, webcasted investor conferences, and/or clinical update calls.

BlackRidge 4.1 Release Introduces New Adaptive Trust Capabilities That Extend Patented First Packet Authentication™ to Endpoints

PR Newswire

RENO, Nev., April 4, 2018

RENO, Nev., April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BlackRidge Technology International, Inc. (OTCQB: BRTI), a leading provider of next generation cyber defense solutions, announced the general availability of the BlackRidge 4.1 release, introducing new adaptive cyber defense capabilities that extend its patented First Packet Authentication™ technology to software endpoints and enable dynamic adjustment of trust levels to stop today's advanced cyber-attacks and protect against insider threats.

The Release 4.1 centers on advanced capabilities to support authentication of network connections using identity and policy enforcement within a customer environment, a critical capability in today's network environments which are adapting to support both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. This ensures that only identified and authorized users and devices have access to key systems and applications.

""We are pleased to participate in the testing of BlackRidge's Release 4.1,"" said Bill Thirsk, Vice President of Information Technology and CIO of Marist College. ""Leveraging the College's multi-platform test beds and research environments assists our long-standing research partner, BlackRidge Technology, to develop adaptive security solutions that defend against advanced threats companies and institutions face each day.""

The Release 4.1 enables more flexible deployment, configuration and integration options to more efficiently support the adaptive IT, OT and cloud security needs of BlackRidge customers and partners. These include enhanced product support for endpoints, gateways, virtual server and cloud appliances, identity integration with Microsoft Active Directory®, additional SIEM and analytic integrations for Splunk® Enterprise, IBM QRadar®, and the ELK Stack, adaptive trust levels accessible through a REST API, and an updated management system and console interface. The Release 4.1 also includes FIPS 140-2 validation, allowing BlackRidge to deploy the release to federal agencies, government service providers and other organizations that require products to be certified to meet security standards.

""Our Release 4.1 provides a new level of network security and cyber defense for our customers and partners that addresses the major failure point behind today's advanced threats and cyber-attacks,"" said Bob Graham, BlackRidge Chairman and CEO. ""Customers can now have significantly greater trust in their critical operational services and how they protect sensitive data.""

The BlackRidge 4.1 Release was tested against key customer use cases in Healthcare with a major hospital; by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for use in the U.S. Department of Defense information networks; in Critical infrastructure and Industrial IoT with the National Renewal Energy Laboratory; with IBM to protect commercial blockchain networks; and with Marist College to protect the management of their network and new cloud services like blockchain.

""This variety of industries, configurations, and deployments supported demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the BlackRidge Adaptive Trust Platform. The BlackRidge 4.1 release supports today's global and evolving businesses that are comprised of legacy, hybrid and new cloud-based applications with many different network configurations and administrative domains,"" said John Hayes, BlackRidge Chief Technology Officer.
