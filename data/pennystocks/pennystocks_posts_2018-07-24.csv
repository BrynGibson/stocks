0,Penny stock watchlist,91fmys,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/91fmys/penny_stock_watchlist/,65,6,"Here's the list that I complied from my personal stock pick generator. I've been trading penny stocks for over 8 years and my goal is to help others make money. I hate seeing people lose money in penny stocks so I am distributing my penny stock picks/advice. Here's a list of momentum stocks:

DDE - Some traders think this stock is heading higher, but failed to understand the catalyst. This stock was part of an M&amp;A deal so the stock price has already been determined. Leave it alone because it's not going anywhere.

HCLP - The stop loss is around $13.20 and the stock hit my divisible by 5 level @ $14.00 even then came crashing back down. Think that was a coincidence? Nope...that's how penny stocks and lower small cap stocks function...it's about psychology.

CUR - This one also hit a divisible by 5 level at $1.50 and then came back down. Making money isn't the only way to stay profitable in penny stocks. You also need to know when to cut your losses when you're wrong. If you understand these levels they could help you substantially cut your losses.

AMPE - This stock closed near a divisible by 5 level at $3.00, so expect some volatility. The resistance is at $3.13 so if price can sustain a level above, it could be a nice b/o.

Regret not buying sooner but great gains. 2 years ago something happened which I cant find out what but today they announced a contract with the military.

 "" The company just announced that its subsidiary, Howco Distributing Co, was awarded a three year 1.7 million dollar contract from the US Government’s Defense Logistics Agency with an option to extend for an additional two years for trailer support components "".
