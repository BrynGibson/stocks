Then yes technically you could trade every day on cash. I'd suggest looking into cmeg if you want to avoid pdt though because I feel like having a legit broker with the right software is so important. I've tried using etrade and webull but they don't give you a desktop program. Etrade will if you get a pro account but you need 25k for that I'm pretty sure. Etrade is cancer for small cash accounts anyways, 7$ each way 14$ per trade. That's somewhat hard to cover with small position sizes. And if you take a loss if you cut quickly and only lose a few dollars then commissions can be more than you lost. Going to cmeg cut my commissions in half and they are offshore.",2018-10-12
