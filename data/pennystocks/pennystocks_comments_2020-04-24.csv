Based on my years of investing and¬†trading¬†BioTech's, I believe the post below is legit, as it correctly lays out the pre-EUA application process, along with the clarification of the process of filing to first receive FDA authorization for professional use only, as the in-home test will take a bit longer to receive an EUA. I found the post to be very logical and well thought out - overall, a VERY good analysis of the current state and timeline for receiving an EUA from the FDA.

""Gukaso"" (Yahoo MB):

To clear up any confusion for Longs and interested Investors....I'd like to discuss my phone call with the FDA office regarding Diagnostic Test Kits for Covid19 but first let me clear up some of the progress that has been being made over the last month....

On April 6th DECN announces they received notification of Acceptance from FDA on April 4th for their Swift Kit Pro Version for Hospitals and Professionals.

On April 7th they announced they received PRE EUA Acknowledgment Letter
and Product Serial Number PEUA200232 for the (Professional Use) and that
the Application for the (Home Use) device is in process as well.

Today they announced that next week they will be asking the FDA to grant them a conditional but immediate EUA approval subject only to testing so that they can move quicker rather than procded with the PRE EUA designation. This is key to understand, if the FDA grants this
""conditinal but immediate EUA approval"" it will be huge for the
company and the stock price, if not, then it will have to go through the regular process of the PRE EUA designation. We will find that out sometime next week it seems. This once again is for the (Professional Use) product, not the (Home Use)

They also announced today that they will be filing soon with the FDA for
EUA for the (Home Use) product very soon. I would also expect to hear
about this either tomorrow or sometime next week, which should give us
more information that things are moving along.

They also in earlier PR explained why they filed these two different products (one for Professional and one for Home use) at different times, which is because the FDA had ""yet to approve a kit designed for individual use, we decided to proceed first with the Pro version Swift kit and follow on as soon as possible with a separate EUA application for the at-home kit as a stand-alone application. We plan to use the same application with minor changes to reflect the individual use.""
This tells me that they are moving very strategically. Once again, in today's PR they explain that they realized in early April that it was not a good idea yet to apply for both but on April 21st the Government changed their minds about (at Home use) and that opened the door for DECN to start moving on applying for this segment as well.... see below

""Our original plan for GenViro! was to offer a single kit containing two PFUs (user's guide), one for Professional Use, one for at-home individual use. Otherwise, the contents of the kits were identical --- 3-test strips, 5-lancets, 1-check strip. However, as March moved into April it became clear that the FDA was not approving individual at-home use kits. So in order to move its application along within the EUA review system, DECN removed all of the description and data owing to the individual at-home kit. And now we bring it back -- by demand.

""On April 21, 2020 the FDA approved an at-home sample collection device for Covid-19 testing, allowing individuals to purchase the collection kits, collect their own samples and then use the mails or other package service to deliver the sample to a laboratory for assay. Oftentimes government moves slowly, but they also tend to build large doors and then open them. DECN views this as an opportunity to become the first company to provide an all-in-one, immediate result, individual at-home Covid-19 test kits with its GenViro! Swift kit for at-home use. We intend to file our stand-alone EUA application for the individual use GenViro! Swift kit by May 1.""

So this is big news as well, we will be informed that they have applied for the (at Home use) product by May 1st. Lots of news next week coming!

Now finally my discussion with the lady from the FDA... I called her because I wanted to verify the PEUA Serial number with the company to know that all this was moving forward. What she told me is that if
a company is in the PRE EUA stage and has the PEAU200--- figure that means they are not listed yet on the FDA website. Only after they are accepted (which as after they have submitted everything needed
for review including ""testing results"") will they move it to EUA and then the company will be listed on the FDA website under the Diagnostic Kits for Covid19 being applied for. Remember that next week DECN
is going to try to bypass all of this for ""Conditional but Immediate"" use. We will either get lucky here or we won't. I think if we have a good product we may get this granted which would pretty much solidify
the company and it's product. This can pretty much put all the bashing to sleep next week.

The lady told me that the EUA process could take 2-3 weeks if it is accepted from the PEUA process. So everything that I have read and talked about with the lady from the FDA makes complete sense. I know the PR's have been a little confusing, but once you sit and read through them one by one you realize that everything is moving along correctly and at a fast pace.",2020-04-24

Robinhood also is a good choice because its a super basic layout, but Robinhood also has its issues. These accounts can be linked to your bank so you can deposit money from bank to brokerage account and vise versa.

\- Start with doing a tiny bit of research before throwing money into any stocks (like even just an afternoon of reading and perousing youtube). Learn what ""fundamentals"" are, like an RSI, MACD, and Simple Moving Averages (SMA's). Use these to try and identify patterns.  Just take a bit to learn a bit. This helped make the market a lot less intimidating for me.

\-Once you have an account somewhere and a little better understanding of how stocks behave, try trading a small amount of cash. Like an amount small enough that if this amount was sitting in your house and caught fire and disappeared you wouldn't be too upset. Utilize free online resources like [Finviz.com](https://Finviz.com), Yahoo Finance, [Barcharts.com](https://Barcharts.com), [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com), and this  Subreddit (caution) in order to do some baseline research into stocks you think will go up.

\-STAY AWAY FROM OPTIONS (for now) 

\-Invest small portions (I personally do about 10%, it's up to you and your research) of your account into stocks that you think have a predictable pattern. 

\- Learn what pattern of trading you like to do. Do you want to buy a stock and sell it a week later? A month later? A year?  Find your pattern, and find stocks that follow it.

\- DON'T BUY ANY STOCK THAT IS POSTED ON REDDIT WITH A ROCKET EMOJI.

\- Learn about what day trading is, and why you can only have 3 of them in 5 days if you're account is small.

\- Trade off of patterns you can identify intellectually, not off of the emotional drive of buying a  rising stock you'll be caught holding onto when it drops.

\- If your stocks go up, congratulations, something is going right. Learn when to take your gains. Stocks go up, and then they go down. In my opinion, selling your stocks that have made you 5% return is better than watchin the stock go to 15% gain and then down to -20%.

\- If your stocks go down, make a tough decision. ""Am I ready to hold this stock for a week/month/several months for it to potentially come back up? Or should I sell at a loss and reinvest my capital in a better trade?"" 

\- As you get more comfortable, and your gains are rolling in, maybe consider adding more money.

\- Gain Tendies

\- Gain More Tendies

\- Drown your enemies in your Tendies

\- Trade small Portion of tendies for Tesla Roadster, yacht, and several bottles of wine with names you can't pronounce. 

\- I am also just another dude on reddit so take this with a grain of salt.

This is key. Easy mistake. But also important, when it comes to penny stocks, is to understand that ALL penny stocks are pump and dumps, by tute owners or smaller parasitic stock gangs. Never allow yourself to *believe* in a company or trust that it's good and is going to get that contract or approval and make a difference and rocket to the top. This is the SECONDARY market; the company itself often doesn't have control of its stock and the players capable of manipulating it are frequently too ruthless to care.

I called them about 2 minutes ago and spoke to one of their representatives and she informed me that there will be a press release coming very soon. She said that all the employees were informed about the suspension today and were told that it was because there were a lot of companies making false claims/bullshit test kits, so most companies that have been making headlines lately will fall subject to the same treatment. Of course I asked when the press release will be, and she said the only thing she knows is that there will be one soon and that it will be before May 7th, and she confirmed what a previous comment said that this will be reversed. 

Again, this could just be bullshit, but I am telling you what I was told when I called. If anyone else calls, I‚Äôm sure you will be told the same thing. Just my 2 cents.

Help me understand:


This cie's stock was worth 1000 + when it came out steadily decreased to 0.01.. what's up with that?

997,ShitPostGuy,fwkpfnd,/r/pennystocks/comments/g6yyt5/bbrw_is_massively_undervalued/fwkpfnd/,1,"So a company has some intrinsic value right? And a share of stock is ownership of a portion of that company. 

How much ownership depends on the total number of shares. If a company worth $1M only one share, that share is worth $1M, if there are two shares each is worth $500k and so on. 

So when the number of shares changes, as often happens in pennies, the value of the each share changes even though the value of the company in total is unchanged. That‚Äôs why you sometimes see a company stock go from $3 to $0.30 very quickly. It‚Äôs called dilution. 

When I wrote this post, BBRW had 34.5M shares priced at .018. So the market believed the whole company was worth $621,000. Now BBRW has 130M shares at .009, so the market believes it‚Äôs worth $1,170,000.

As for price swings and spikes: the company has   some intrinsic value, but the stock price is NOT a perfect representation of that value. Stock price is a representation of investor sentiment about the company. When investors are scared they sell shares and the stock price goes down; when they‚Äôre hyped they buy and it goes up. 

All the market does is provide you with the current price of a share of stock. As a intelligent investor, you‚Äôre job is to determine the intrinsic value of the company and buy shares when they‚Äôre priced below that value and sell them when they‚Äôre above it.",2020-04-24

It‚Äôs not uncommon in OTC stocks to see spikes.

That got people really hyped so there was a buying frenzy which spiked up the price. Then people started taking profits and the sell offs caused a panic where everyone tried to sell asap to get out before it dropped more.

The earnings report was very disappointing, so the price will probably fall even more until they find the right PR to cause another buying frenzy.

As usual, nobody knows what happens here.

As usual, everyone fucking knows it could be a pump and dump, and nobody ever said it wasn't. And still, nobody is saying it isn't. 

Proceed with caution with any of these stocks.

I do think the change in pattern for the timing of their stock was pretty telling yesterday, though. The announcement came later than it normally does as the stock climbed in anticipation of the news, and then it tanked.

That's a bad sign. 

But sitting here listening to 500 assholes say ""i told you so"" is pretty fucking annoying, especially considering nobody was ever arguing that there was no way it was a pump and dump.

And hopefully it's not, but we'll see what happens. It still remains true that they've always been a decent company (the litigation between them and J&amp;J is still hardly nearly as damning as you make it sound), but like we've all said before, again, 1,000 times, we've always known it could be a pump and dump, or it could be honest people that just fail, or the virus could go away. 1,000 things can go wrong to make any of these stocks tank.

Instead, they seem to have a boatload of debt ( thought they have service areas as assets).

LITTLE RIVER, S.C--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 22, 2020-- PCT LTD (OTC Pink: PCTL) is excited to announce they are continuing their rapid growth and expansion plans and have increased sales and distribution channels for their **EPA registered disinfecting solutions by introducing three additional distributors.**


Frog Foggers LLC of South Carolina, with offices in Charlotte, North Carolina also (www.frogfoggers.com), and eOn Mist LLC (www.eOnmist.com ‚Äì to be active soon) of Missouri have joined PCTL‚Äôs growing network of fluid distributors and sub-registrants. Both of these companies have commenced sales and distribution of PCTL fluids very recently; production/receiving capacities will ramp up, given growth and volume over time. An additional distributor serving Missouri, is currently expanding into surrounding states. Combined, these three distributors will provide service to the southeast, south central, and Midwest regions.


‚Äú**Fluid sales and distribution are a major component of our current model**,‚Äù explains PCT Corp. President Bill Prince. ‚ÄúWe now have distribution channels either in or within striking distance of several key markets which will be a tremendous source of growth for us in 2020 and beyond.‚Äù


The company is reviewing a large number of additional distribution prospects and **expects to continue its expansion** over the next several months with the goal of increasing PCTL‚Äôs regional footprint in several key markets.


‚Äú**We have many interested parties in our pipeline**,‚Äù says CEO Gary Grieco, noting that the company is expanding both rapidly and purposefully. ‚ÄúWe are very thoroughly reviewing these companies to ensure they are able to meet both our high standards of quality and professionalism; in addition to being able to effectively service the strategic regions we‚Äôve identified as holding the most opportunity for us.‚Äù


To further explain the company‚Äôs rapid growth plans, CEO Gary Grieco appeared on an April 21st episode of The Stock Day Media Podcast with host Everett Jolly.

First, we do not have a head start on vaccine development, which normally takes &gt;1yr. So Let's say we started in December... see the problem? We have some really brilliant people at the CDC, but testing and synthesis still take time. We have two basic eventualities. One where people stay inside for the duration of the outbreak (which will not happen) and markets are choked into bankruptcy for the next 5 or so months until a vaccine is found, or the other where people parade outside like they already are and pop the top off of new-case rates, making the situation and the resulting panic worse but still choking the markets, only more aggressively.

This doesn't even touch the oil industry which would be having a problem even \*if\* the pandemic wasn't around. Tech is doing well, but remember the market is made up of people's savings.

They're either mad that they sold their stock or can't buy anymore. There is currently ZERO PROOF that a crime has been committed. The only thing stated by the SEC is that they are reviewing DECN's claims. There have been lots of companies and individuals throughout time who have had such things happen, not just in the stock market, but in social society in general. Tesla is one of them. A lot of people thought he was a fruitcake, but his methods worked. People got upset because it was something they had never heard of before. 

On the contrary, I'm glad to have over 6,000 shares locked in to DECN during a time when nobody else can purchase. I was shocked that the price flew up so quickly and seemed to be doing so well with absolutely **massive** volume and then it hit the floor at speed twice as fast. I have never seen a stuck drop so much. It makes me wonder if the SEC didn't halt it because they're trying to find out why it dropped so much (e.g. someone who had a massive amount of shares was trying to con the market in any number of ways) and investigate some transactions.

I wish I would have bought more before they froze it. I suspect that it may stay frozen until May 7. DECN may be providing documentation. Quite frankly, I don't think that the CEO of such a company would risk going to prison by lying about products on such a massive scale. Of what benefit would that be to them or the company? Do I think something fishy is going on? Absolutely. It isn't the company that I believe is a fraud, however. I think some of the ""big boy"" traders in this stock have been trying to manipulate the stock and may be quietly under investigation, as well. It dropped faster than any stock I have ever seen. I was literally reloading the page on my cell phone watching it go down sometimes 1-2 cents every second or two. When it drops that fast, something is wrong in the trading.

All to say...do I think everything is fine? Absolutely. May 7 (if they don't open it before) will open with a bang and might hit $5 upon opening.

They're spending billions of dollars trying to stimulate the economy and they will keep doing so.

Also people today held there stocks usually people sell on a friday but the potential is there. I won't say it will hit a dollar but like I said if the kits work the demand will be high. 

People talk about production if they can keep up. All I can say in a procurement point of view. No company will hold back in making sure that they can satisfy the demand. Delays in production?

Could have been someone else who put in a huge chunk the second they heard there'd be an announcement. could be a hedge fund.

This thing just got started, there's a lot of companies involved, DECNs letter of suspension really doesn't sound that bad.

Finger prick test for a virus test...invented by a company that already does blood testing for diabetes? Doesn't sound far-fetched to me.

In retrospect, what the absolute wisest thing to do in that situation would have been to sell at 9:14, right before the news **should** have come out.

T-Mobile will offer home internet over their 600MHz and 2.5 Ghz waves that they got from Sprint, and they are claiming to provide 100-500 Mbps with no data cap. of course that could change since it is not Live right now. they do in some select cities have a 100Mbps home service with no data cap. but not sure what that is working on, more than likely LTE, but that is just a guess.  with these companies doing this, it won't be long before they all offer 1+Gbps service to the home and then why would you go with a slower service? T-Mobile's current testing shows 5ms lag time, better than anything except direct Fiber.  The next few years of internet are going to be really interesting. I know Comcast is offering 2Gbps on Coax, at least in the greater chicago market, and with the new TP archer router that has a 2.5Gbps wan port that connects to their gateway that also has a 2.5Gbps port, you can now share that in your home. that is how they are going to be competing, but it gets to a point that it just gets ridiculous. In my home, 2Gbps would be nice, so we can share it very well. i have 1Gbps and i use the full pipe constantly. they hate me using10+ TB a month. they had to upgrade the fiber node and their router in the office just because i use so much i was congesting my area. o well. i pay for it and they give it, so i use it.  i think 2Gbps is more then enough for any home for quite some time. maybe in 5 years when computer have fiber NICs instead of ethernet, or we start getting better prices on CAT7 cable, and 10Gbps NICs, there is not a use for speeds that high.  but then, what in the world are we going to be using that speed for?

They have a legitimate product and it is manufactured in South Korea presently. When they join with a larger company or get bought out, production will increase rapidly.

You must be one of those paid bashers that I see on the forums who bash the stock even when it goes up. There are also a number of individuals who submitted falsified info to the SEC. A handful of them have their names known and likely will face legal action or prison in the future for submitting falsified info to the SEC to badmouth DECN. The ""reports"" were basically fake.

The only ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù here are ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù they‚Äôll get FDA approval. And ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù they get FDA approval. 

But the facts are the facts. Their CEO got fired from his last company for being a total piece of shit. 

The company he runs right now is in danger of being financially insolvent as they barely have $50k to their names. I have more money in my bank account then this company does.  

Point out what they they did wrong? He got caught making numerous misleading statements which the SEC has clearly documented and laid out. If you actually read the document you wouldn‚Äôt need me to point out anything as it‚Äôs very clear what they did wrong.

You're clearly a troll trying to get other people to not buy it. Curiously, there are lots of people like you on various forums specifically for DECN. They actually take hours out of their day to post every 30 minutes to an hour in a near-constant attempt to discredit the stock. With every positive news article and stepping stone, even when the stock goes up in price, they have something negative to say. Competitors, people who didn't buy the stock and now can't, etc. When the FDA approves the physical test kits (two types of them, by the way) that are in their possession, the stock will shoot up. The FDA and SEC are totally different. Once it gets FDA approval, the SEC doesn't matter seeing as how they have presented zero evidence and even missed their own deadline to submit said evidence to keep the stock suspended. FEMA has shown interest in the tests. They're based on an existing platform that Decision Diagnostics has used for 18 years for diabetes testing. This isn't some spring-up company out of nowhere. Doctors offices, schools, hospitals, sports teams, etc. Contacts have been reaching out as far as Mike Pence and the Coronavirus team of the president to get the kits distributed. People don't peddle on a high level what can't sell. Scammers go for low and quiet. The time will come when you will kick yourself for telling others not to buy this. They'll be doing well and you'll be struggling. As for me, I've done my due diligence and have 100% confidence in the company for a number of other reasons that I'm not going to list here because that's your job to seek out for yourself.

1. Berman does his own PR
2. The SEC has contacted him before, but he was surprised that trading was suspended today (though 23 others have been as well)
3. Responding to Gukaso's concern of DECN being placed on the grey list, Berman asks why it would take time to bring it back out. I'm concerned about his response
4. Sunday night PR is confirmed. However, ""I asked him if he was going to show the SEC what he needed and he said that he didn't need to do that, and that he had talked to a few different lawyers and they had told him he doesn't need to contact the SEC. So again it looks like it is up the the market makers from what he was saying""
5. Berman believes people from message boards were behind the suspension; ""the huge trade that was planned out that sold like 9 million shares around .23 was the event that triggered everything""
6. ""I asked him if everything with the FDA would be moving forward? and he said yes why wouldn't it? I said well I would assume that it would but wouldn't it make things more difficult? He said it may, but not necessarily."" Also, he asserts he has two jobs: ""one was to get the product out and the other to make a return for his investors""
7. Berman refused to show FDA documents to Gukaso and cited privacy, though I do understand why Berman said no.
8. ""I then confirmed with him that at the very least if the product makes it out of the PEUA phase and into the EUA phase that the company would then be listed in the FDA's website, and he did confirm that that would be the case. He also stated that he thought the second application that they will be turning in now he thinks will take a bit longer for FDA to decide upon because of the first application. Not sure why he thought this but seems as though maybe because of the testing they are still finishing and the fast tracking they are trying to do to bypass the PEUA stage.""",2020-04-24

Yes, conspiring against a company to coordinate a selloff for the purpose of tanking a stock (especially if from an enemy stock) is likely illegal when they get tracked down. Buying and selling is perfectly legal. But if you conspire with 10 people and happen to own a market-tanking amount of stock and agree with them to all sell at the same time for the purpose of bringing down the stock and damaging the company....nope, that's criminal. SEC will know exactly what happened and who did what. They might have sold their stock, but I'll bet that money has been suspended and is on hold pending investigation. Wouldn't surprise me if some of the other companies aren't buying into their competitors and trying to tank them. Who do you know of that has $4+ million worth of a penny stock? An enemy company would. Bought into it when it was lower, sold it off higher at a profit and then tanked the stock. Made a profit (legal), but in the name of trying to bring the company down (not legal). Wait until names start popping up and people start going to prison.

Understand how an increase in a stock percentage directly relates to market capitalization. Why did/would this company become 10,20,30% more valuable. 

What works for me is this mindset:
Lock in gains. Don‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre going to time the bottoms and tops perfectly, every stock you buy or sell has to be sold or bought. It‚Äôs a zero sum game.

Is all hope lost in getting most or all of it back? Or if it opens on May 7 (or whenever) and I sell as fast as possible to recover what I can, is that money officially ""mine"" or are they going to place this stock on hold again and hold more transactions? Obviously, they have to release it at some point or just refund everyone the $0.275 that they've reset it to. I find it interesting that they can just ""reset the stock price"" and say, ""Well, we're just going to set it at x where it was on x day"" and just make it that. Almost seems like the paradox of the US government. ""Why don't we just print some more money?""

Wondering how fast this is going to drop at opening. Is there a way to pre-trade before the market opening?
