If you're looking to invest, look at what you and your friends are buying now, compare that to forward earnings.  Your demographic is tough for professionals to analyze,  so you have inside information.   Put your money there, and maybe check it once a month.

The best thing I did for myself early on was to put small amounts of money out of reach of daily/unexpected expenses. I had savings and investment accounts, then a 401k at my first couple jobs, but I followed my uncle's advice and put 100-300 a month into my own Roth IRA and treated it like a bill payment. I never allowed myself to consider it my own money and I eventually even got my uncle to help me invest it more wisely.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years into adulthood, 2008 happened and I was laid off about 3 weeks after depleting most of my savings on major home renovations. My uncle stepped in and helped me stabilize my finances, then against his wishes, liquidate my 401k's to get enough capital for my own business. Thankfully, he steered me clear of the IRA money and I sort of forgot about it until last year. Since then, that business didn't work out and it was 3 more years until I was stable with a full time job again.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, I decided to get off my butt and start working towards retirement again. It quickly became apparent that I was behind, being 34 and still living a paycheck away from ruin. I went to my uncle for help, and he reminded me of my IRA. Well, I invested about 4500 in there total, and my uncle and grandmother had put in $2k more for me, then he did minimal management for 12 years. Today, that 6500 has turned into a little less than $13k. It isn't much, but seeing that really eased my mind about getting to retirement. If I had seen that oney a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have it still. I wish I could have been fully responsible for that, but it taught me how to make sure I am in the future!",2019-06-10

I also use the Biopharmcatalyst website to see upcoming news for biotech companies.

That's how I do it now mostly. I used to have a trading software that let you scan directly for news based on company stats like price, volume, float, etc. But that shit was expensive tho lol",2019-06-10

At this age some of the advice I wish I would have gotten would have been: What drives the value of each index? What drives value in each company? Each sector? Each part of the market cycle where do I see money shifting. Understanding what drives value in your investments helps you to understand what you actually want to invest in. Get a good index. Watch it go up/down and see why. Look at the history of the markets and really develop an understanding. A lot of people on here don‚Äôt have any actual experience in the investment industry they just have more time in it so the best value I‚Äôve gotten is understanding to pull the trigger on my own investments for my own reasons.",2019-06-10
