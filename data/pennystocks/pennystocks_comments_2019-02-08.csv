Turner Receives $4,000,000 Commitment For Infrastructure Roll-Out From GHS Investments LLC
HOUSTON, Feb. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- West Announcement -- Turner Valley Oil and Gas, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC: TVOG), a company focused on capitalizing on technology-forward American infrastructure expansion, announced today that it has accepted terms for a placement plan with GHS Investments, LLC (“GHS”), a New York based, public equity fund.
After considering various options, the Company chose GHS, a leading private investment and management group providing financial solutions for small cap enterprises, to assist in the roll-out of Turner’s disruptive infrastructure strategy as the anchor investor.  GHS has agreed to terms with TVOG following extensive due diligence, management interviews, and a detailed analytic study of the Company. 
Turner is pleased to inform investors that it has received an initial $4,000,000 commitment to be invested as key acquisitions are completed.  The price of each placement will be adjusted as the market valuation increases but at no time shall be sold less than $0.0125. Proceeds from the investment will be used for growth capital and to fund the initial stages of the Company’s focused infrastructure build out that includes acquiring and investing in a series of smaller and mid-sized companies that are positioned for rapid growth.  This will help establish an operating platform across divisions of infrastructure including services, supply chain, and technology. In addition, as part of the transaction GHS has agreed to fund registration costs up front, which will conserve Turner capital and limit dilution to shareholders.  While this initial placement is completed, Turner will move to finalize engagement of its investment banking partner and prepare for the Preferred Stock placement plan as previously announced.
In discussion about the funding and the remaining compliance steps, Turner CEO Steve Helm stated, “The capital influx from GHS is a crucial step for Turner and will provide the foundation for growth that we envision.  GHS has vast experience in the infrastructure industry and we are grateful  that they recognize our Company as a coming major player in this space that is well positioned for growth.”  He went on to state, “It is an exciting time now that we have secured the first two acquisitions for Turner within the infrastructure services segments to serve as cornerstones for the platform we have created, and we are going to continue an aggressive acquisition and growth plan. The steps outlined in our Company website update on January 24 are the critical next components so that we may be recognized on a major exchange and increase our transparency to the investment community, and we are working diligently to finalize and announce our results.” 
Now that terms have been reached, next Turner is expected to engage the securities legal counsel, execute final placements documents and file its registration statement with the SEC. Details of the financing agreement will be included in an 8-K by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and can be found at www.sec.gov.

They falsify documents, technology, and all that bullshit to simply gain insider trading advantages, and looking at a chart on SHMP, that thing is fuckin’ crazy. 

And to the people thinking it will literally make 300-400% returns - you might be right. But things like this go tits up when a company realizes it looks undervalued per share, and does a reverse split - congrats, yes, the price is higher now, but your 30K shares are now 100 shares. 

I don’t play OTC for a reason - I’ve seen people throw away their entire 401Ks/IRAs on it, worth 20-100K worth of investment, and that’s all they have. It’s sad.

I just mean that I believe it's a stock worth holding for several months or even several years, which is obviously relatively rare on the otc.  And of course I may be completely wrong here.  

But I don't invest money unless I can afford to lose it.  

Look, I'm not a professional here at all.  I don't claim to be one.  

But I've done good trading on the otc the past year or so.  I can make at the minimum a few hundred a week flipping stocks.  

Half of that money goes straight right out of my brokerage account every week and either into my savings or into my IRA.  

The other half I continue using for daily trades, and then, on occasion, when I see a company like this that I think has legitimate potential, I make a bigger investment and hold.  I've done well on a few companies that way.  I made a five figure profit last year, and so far in 2019 I'm up around 5k.  

Has that just been luck?  Maybe.  Could there be better things to do with my money?  Probably.  


But for someone who does this ""part time"" and goes to bed two or three hours before the market even closes because I work third shift...I think I'm doing ""ok"" at the very least.

Your explanation makes sense and nor do I think it’s stupid, but just not something I would do due to high margin requirements of OTC / low liquidity / buncha other reasons. 

My education ain’t really shit either, FYI. I don’t have a masters or anything. I just learn by trial and error like most traders, but don’t get emotional by it. 

As long as you have set guidelines and only invest in what you can lose, then you’re doing it right, but it can always be improved.. Ex - options/forex/CFD’s make OTC gains look very very tiny, and there is a general higher success rate comparing. 

But most people don’t know what those are, and invest in money that they don’t want to lose or can lose, for that matter. A general guideline - if you can’t stand a 20% price drop in one day, you don’t belong or deserve to trade. ",2019-02-08
