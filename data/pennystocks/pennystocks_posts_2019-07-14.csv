I recently bought 130 shares of this on Friday and plan to purchase more tomorrow as long as nothing tanks. The monthly chart seems to have some support around the $0.50 mark, and the daily looks like it is setting up for a breakout. I'm gonna be cautious though because the weekly charts have been downtrending, so if the price falls below that support level  this week, I will sell off and take a very minimal loss.",2019-07-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cd8lmy/tcon/

Also, we have tremendous support from the Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas ($9.1M remaining of an $18.7M award) and the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation, who is paying a large part of the Ewing sarcoma clinical program. So, the funding and support that Salarius receives is substantial, coming from many areas. ""    


Raised funding into own private company &amp; STILL has more funding from cancer research institues to afford investing in FLKS in January to fund them into mid 2020!     


""Salarius will house itself at Johnson &amp; Johnson's JLABS @ TMC"" - 2016  ""formed in a partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson..."" - 2016 also   


 "" What we're able to do, now that we have a merged company, is take those resources and in 2019 focus on the execution of our clinical programs with our lead compound, Seclidemstat, for which we received IND activation in March 2018. ""   
 IND activation 1 year and 4 months a go,    
Clincical trials completed  15 Sep 2018 &amp; 20 December 2018   


 TLDR; it looks like Salarius finally in 8 years being a private company, have done enough clinical trials with acceptance of an IND to further their clinical studies. My previous post has links that indicate they worked alongside some big pharmaceutical companies in the stock market (more than one). It looks to be, being the private company they have invested in FLKS in January funding them for an additional year while funding their own clinical studies for cancer.    


Also looks that they would rather be their own pubilc company, why is this important? For a private company to jump into the stock market on a merger of another stock that has plummeted from $20 to 0.30c, to fund them in January 2019 and to continue their merger after seeing the stocks performance over the past 6 months still under $1 puts them at a big risk, risk's companies wouldn't take, risk's that could ruin business's and companies, risk's that most people only take when they're sure of something",2019-07-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cd7yh1/flks_salarius_new_merger_research_links_provided/

Have Some Questions,cd6xkq,alkjdasoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cd6xkq/working_on_an_indicator_to_day_trade_penny_stocks/,4,2,"New to the community here. All these years I've been day trading options. Recently started making my own indicator (for the ThinkorSwim platform). Randomly came across a few penny stocks and surprisingly the signals were fairly accurate on penny stocks (although I designed the indicator to work with large caps).

Here are a few examples: https://imgur.com/a/J5I9tZ8

My observation: The signals tend to be very reliable on stocks that gapped up overnight. (bigger the gap the better)

My question: Does anyone know a scanner that I can use to look for big gap ups and downs on penny stocks? I'm currently using the default Gap Up and Gap Down scanners in ThinkorSwim. Not sure if that should be enough or is there a specialized one for penny stocks.",2019-07-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cd6xkq/working_on_an_indicator_to_day_trade_penny_stocks/
