Legal grows want to know when pesticide sprays are happening so they can protect their plants. They have threatened to sue if their fellow farmers do not alert them. If you have anything that comes into contact with the plant the plant will absorb it. Indoor operations are too expensive around here so there is a battle going on.  


I'd like to see a cannabis company using vertical grows. You can produce more yield and faster. Japan is a leader in this space.

No, you would make $200 if the stock moves to 101 in price. 

if the stock moves to 200, you would be a freaking billionaire in one trade. A stock doubling from $1 to $2 is not the same as $100 to $200

I bought a few weeks back, sold for a bit of profit @ .007 and am riding 225k free shares.  

Probably going to buy more, especially with their share reduction.  They have a few channels on telegram. First one is about app and company, second is more about the stock.

Disadvantages of robinhood, I’m pretty sure they don’t allow premarket, and you cannot find all pennystocks",2019-05-31
