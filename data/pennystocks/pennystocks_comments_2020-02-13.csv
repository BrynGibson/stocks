In my opinion nothing new but the potential of the pipeline was once again emphasized. It looks like investors were looking for preliminary read-out data given that the conference participations were only recently announced. This makes me wonder whether the conference next week will bring something new or whether the read-out timeline will just be reiterated. I also hope for positive results in H1 and a positive share price development in the midterm but fear that the ongoing studies might require another funding round at some point although liquidity lasts until beginning of 2021.
