market order - buy/sell at the current price. Robinhood executes these as limit orders for +-5% of the market price. e.g. I want to sell this stock, so I put a market order out and someone will buy it from me for around that price, but maybe less than I want.

limit order - buy/sell at a specified price or better (bigger or smaller depending if you're selling or buying respectively). e.g stock is at $2.17, I want to buy and spend at most $2.15, so I put a limit order for that price

stop loss and stop limit orders are the same, but they add in another step. you set a ""trigger"" (my term, idk what others call it) price, and if the stock price goes past this, then your order or limit order gets placed. for buying this is if the price exceeds your trigger, for selling it's if it falls below your trigger. this is used to prevent huge losses. example:

I bought aker at $.15. now it's at $.50! I want to make sure it doesn't drop to $.20, and I lose all my profit, so I set a stop loss for $.40. now, if the price falls below $.40, I'll automatically have a market order put in to sell my stock. otherwise if I wasn't paying attention, it could continue to fall. 

any questions?",2018-02-02
