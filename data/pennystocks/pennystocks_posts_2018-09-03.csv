0,The potential in $GALT,9chpdx,Ryael,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9chpdx/the_potential_in_galt/,21,9,"$GALT and their (potential blockbuster) drug GR-MD-02.

Note: I am long and have a position in GALT.

-Waiting for Cohort 3 results of pairing with Keytruda. First two cohorts had promising results but C3 will be the big one. Check ClinicalTrials.Gov for details. Early efficacy shows a jump from 33% with Keytruda alone to 62% when paired with GR-MD-02.

-Management gets a bonus if they sell/make a deal by the end of the year/Jan 15 2019, just before options expire on the 18th.

-NASH w/o varices looks like a real profit maker for GR-MD-02 but more info is needed and much longer testing.

-GR-MD-02 could increase the efficacy of cancer treatments AND even be its own treatment breaking down Galectin-3 which has been hypothesized to play a huge factor in tumor production of cancer.

Personal take: My mind runs to buyout and I will list why.

-The major investor and founder is the 10X fund. This fund is run by James Czirr who recently released a statement resigning from the TNTY board of directors, stating, “GALT has embarked on finding a strategic partner, and or a buyer for either the drug or the company.”

-Richard Uihlein is involved.

-The company is not presently hiring for any positions that I can find which would go against the logic of wanting to start Phase III testing soon.

I believe the buyout could be from $2.5 billion to...honestly $40+ billion. I know that seems like a stretch and I have to agree but the cancer results, if shown to continue or even improve with Cohort 3, would be absolutely insane. If we are talking about increasing the efficacy of one cancer treatment, that’s insane. If we are talking about multiple, and specifically tumor reduction or removal, then I honestly can’t even guess.

All this said, if Cohort 3 fails, I think the company is going to drop off a precipice.

There are some great articles out there, I recommend you to look up articles by Sultan Beardsley for good information and of course the last years worth of reports from GALT.",2018-09-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9chpdx/the_potential_in_galt/
