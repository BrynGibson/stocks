78,IMIMF My going long update,g2kw00,Knight_Aero,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g2kw00/imimf_my_going_long_update/,2,3,"IMC International \[OTC Gold Mining and Exploration Stock (also on Canadian under IMCX)\]

When I started day trading February an investment advisor told me to take the first 10%-15% profit you make and put into a long investment that you feel is going to be positive over weeks or months to learn more about long positions and following news and such. So with the pandemic sprouting up early March I figured looking at something that may have had low impact and did some research. Well gold and mining seemed to be the best choice at the time. So I have been in with this stock since mid March when it was averaging between .3 and .33 as they were in the middle of officially acquiring mining land that is known to provide good yields for multiple mineral sources. After that successful process they hired a survey team to provide samples and get them tested which originally was going to be done nearer the end of April. They already have some samples and have sent them to a lab to be analyzed which should take a few weeks. Results from these tests will be the next big ticket item and show whether the land they gained has potential and in what areas, especially with gold going up. The pandemic has also not seemed to impact their work according to them, but the labs may be a different story. We shall see. The follow up stage would obviously be to prepare to start mining which is aimed to be by the end of the year. I think the recent financing new is meant to start that stage.

So I figured I would bring up the stock again as it recently gained $8 million equity financing to help keep the company going through its development plans. If someone more attuned could clarify what this means because if I read it correctly a large portion of ""units""/stocks will be purchased at a ""discount"" by the lender then bought back at a 50% premium later on by the company which I am not sure how that affects investors. I may completely have it wrong but whatever the case it seems like a positive cash injection in preparation for some major efforts to come. Here is link to the news release:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imc-international-mining-corp-enters-110000766.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imc-international-mining-corp-enters-110000766.html) 

This lower volume stock has been clearly bullish and steadily rises or even gaps up every day since the beginning of April. A minor sell off on the 8th occurred but otherwise each day has ended green. It has had consistent opening trends although they are not ""tradable"" short trends in my opinion as they are quick injections and sell offs. Because its lower volume the charts are very sideways. Dealing with this type of stock is obviously risky but the long term projections seem strong especially being a mining stock.

So here is my newbie outlook:

\-If it can hold above .5 the rest of the month, I think it could easily spike to highs above $1 and maybe $1.25 when the results of the survey are announced but could easily drop like a rock if bad or unimpressive.

\-If the momentum it has continues from news or interest, it looks like it could hit $1 by May which would be more than impressive. Now I have seen that they have been paying for ""positive"" news publications on some blog site which is fine as long as nothing sketchy has popped up elsewhere and I am sure there is probably bad news somewhere but so far the outlooks have made sense. Their publicity plan I think goes out through May 24th so we will see how that pans out.

\-Personally, my goal is hoping that they do well hoping the hit the $1.3 mark. At that point I will be selling 1/3 and trailing 1/3 by .15 or .25 depending and manually watch with the rest. At this point I have been profitable and I don't see it crashing back to .3 unless some pack of Grizzlies decided to take a stroll out of nowhere.

\-For anyone new to trading, be aware that the trade fee/commission is not the same with an OTC stock. Something I learned the hard way but no longer regretting.

I hope my general breakdown of what I have been following is informative, honestly not trying to hype but I am trying to get other more experienced opinions. If you do join the party, I recommend not watching any gold discovery shows...they are trash LoL",2020-04-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g2kw00/imimf_my_going_long_update/

In short, a study in Germany used 2-DG to prevent replication of COVID-19 using a human cell line. They were able to achieve 100% prevention at non-toxic levels. 2-DG is not a good drug candidate due to it's rapid metabolism by the body, so it does not reach target cells at useful concentrations. Moleculin has been working on a drug (WP1122) that is a pro-drug of 2-DG. WP1122 has much better up-take, and is able to reach target tissues at much higher concentrations than 2-DG with smaller doses. Once it is absorbed, it is broken down leaving 2-DG, the active component that was used in the German study. They are currently putting together everything they need for clinical trials, but do not yet have FDA approval, although they are confident under the circumstances it won't be long. They also mentioned they have adequate funding through Q1 2021.

TLDR: Moleculin's drug is a very promising COVID-19 treatment, they have the funding for trials, just need approval. 

(Also worth mentioning that I have a B.S. in Biodmedical science, and am a medical student, so I actually understood most of what they were talking about during the conference call and it all seemed like good news to me, but I don't have a PhD in this stuff.)",2020-04-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g2nwwo/mbrx_conference_call/

Don't waste time studying the market... It's no longer the stock market we though it is ie. a public entity.  

The only way forward is let's group together -- I am proposing to form a new money mafia = unity is strength. In fact, the only way we could do anything meaningful in this insane mobster run world is to gang up.

If it's NOT the place to ask please let me know and I'll gladly take my post down and repost in an appropriate sub/thread.

I'm really interested in penny stocks/stocks in general and always have been but I'm stuck not knowing how to begin trading or what to do. I'm interested in trading penny stocks and making small profit because I'm not financially able to do a whole lot at a time right now so trading anything other than penny stock doesn't seem like a good fit.

I guess what I'm asking is, where do I begin? What do I do for a beginner who's interested but has little knowledge about stock market? And lastly, is trading penny stock profitable? If so how?

Not quite a penny stock, currently sitting at $7.36. They announced that they’ll report Q1 earnings May 7th.
 They have had been slowly keeping up all week, and likely will until at least May 7th.

I don’t have any shares in this company yet, but this looks like a solid build over the next few weeks. It’s up 30% on the week. I would assume more time on people’s hands, means more people, especially kids, downloading games and stuff.
