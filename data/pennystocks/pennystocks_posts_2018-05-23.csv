Doing some of these calculations can be a bit of a pain especially since they're penny, even more so if they're sub penny. I use this simple straight forward free stock profit calculator to not only do the calculations, but store the stocks for reference later. This is not to be spam since I've found it helpful.

They are on both platforms:

SAGD Interviews Cannabis Industry Leaders at MJBizCon NEXT
GlobeNewswire•May 22, 2018
LAS VEGAS, May 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire  – South American Gold Corp (SAGD), is pleased to announce that the “The Kush Journals,” a wholly owned subsidiary of SAGD, recently held interviews and conversations with some of the cutting-edge leaders within the cannabis industry. 

""The MJBizCon NEXT conference is an excellent cannabis conference for our podcasting team,” said David Reeves, SAGD CEO. “The conference is filled with companies new and old sharing their most cutting-edge processes, services, and products with the world. We are a company intent on staying ahead of the cannabis curve and speaking with important companies and industry leaders is one way we ensure our longevity and relevancy. And certainly our presence at this conference opens the door wider for strategic partnerships as SAGD passionately pursues acquisitions and joint-ventures.”

The Kush Journals podcast team held scheduled interviews with Mr. Morris Denton, CEO of Compassionate Cultivation; Ms. Nancy White, Founder and CEO of Wana Brands; Amy Anderle, owner at L’Eagle Services and Communications and Outreach Director at Cannabis Certification Council; and Derek Smith, Founder and CEO at Resource Innovation Institute.

“We were very fortunate to be able to speak with each of these people,” said Julie Peterson, CEO of cNation Channel and part of the Kush Journals podcasting team. “Through our strategic relationship with Grasslands: A Journalism-Minded Agency, one of the cannabis industry’s most conscientious and important public relations agencies, we were able to secure these interviews.”

The podcasting team works hard to foster industry relationships to further its media reach in order to attend these events as credentialed media. The access granted to media members far surpasses that of the average conference attendee.

“We will publish each interview on separate days this week, starting with our first interview with Mr. Morris Denton,” said Peterson. “Listeners will quickly get a feel for the current state of industry affairs, as well as what’s on the horizon. In short, it’s all very exciting. What a great time to be in the cannabis industry!” concluded Peterson.

The Kush Journals podcast, hosted and distributed by Libsyn, can be found on the cNation website at cnation.com, in the Libsyn directory of podcasts, and through its social media presence at Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

The cannabis social media division of SAGD is comprised of cNation, KushJournal, KindaHigh, PotPons, PotCircles, and WeedFeedLive. cNation and its podcasts represent the grassroots outreach of the company's media division, with Podcasts available for listen on Libsyn.com, Facebook, Twitter, iHEARTRadio, and Spotify.

11,$APPS - Digital Turbine legit hold?,8lm6p1,SquiddyVon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8lm6p1/apps_digital_turbine_legit_hold/,5,9,"I'm no pro, but this company seems super legit to me, especially at the current price. Solid mid\-term hold? Like maybe 6mo to a year? If their next report is a good one, would think this has a chance to sky rocket. Also saw on twitter they are actively hiring more, so would think that means good things as well, and from what I can tell they have some very large clients that should help bring long term stability. 

Anyone know much about this company?",2018-05-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8lm6p1/apps_digital_turbine_legit_hold/
