&amp;#x200B;

Let's be real, the only reason people look into stocks is to make money, that's a fact, why else would you spend your days watching youtube videos and analyzing chart patterns if you knew nothing would come out of it. Anyway I've made around 900k doing it so far, and I don't ever post on Reddit but I'm tired of all the bullshit ""guru's"" and ads, and timothy sykes and Jason bond or whoever the fuck. They don't care about your success, they only care about the money you give them, I, on the other hand, teach people, and I care about their success, I do a 1 on 1 video chat with my clients and I make sure they are performing well, answering their questions and tracking their progress. BUT I also just don't teach any guy/gal that reaches out to me and says ""omg omg how do I make money"" forget that. I teach the people who want. it. who take it seriously, who want financial freedom, who can't stand the thought of a 9-5 job and most importantly the people who do their research beforehand and come prepared, it also does cost money because people take things that are expensive way more seriously than free items. anyway,et me know if you're interested, my ig: aaron\_ulsh1 &amp; my email is aju199913@gmail.com",2019-12-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eckonq/i_made_900k_i_can_show_you_exactly_how/

10,Arch Biopartners Announces Metablok Achieves Primary Endpoints of Safety and Tolerability in Phase I Trial,eceezn,thesiscapitalInc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eceezn/arch_biopartners_announces_metablok_achieves/,1,2,"TORONTO, Dec. 18, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arch Biopartners Inc., (‚ÄúArch‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (TSX Venture: ARCH and OTCQB: ACHFF) announced today that the Phase I human trial of Metablok (LSALT peptide) has completed dosing of all scheduled volunteers and Metablok has met the primary endpoints of safety and tolerability. Metablok is the Company‚Äôs lead drug candidate for treating organ damage caused by inflammation.  


Metablok was well tolerated during the placebo-controlled trial and no drug-related adverse effects were observed in any of the forty-four volunteers, split into five groups. Three of the groups received either a low, medium or high single dose of Metablok and the remaining two groups received a low or medium single daily dose over three days.

Arch is expected to close the trial over the next week with a database lock in early 2020. Final results and study reports will be released over the next 3 months.

During this time, Arch management will begin preparations to engage the U.S. FDA in discussion regarding a New Drug Application and Phase II trial for Metablok.

**Metablok Phase I clinical trial**

Arch has been conducting the Phase I clinical trial for Metablok with healthy volunteers in Melbourne, Australia. The Phase I trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single and multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of Metablok.

The successful Phase I trial is expected to be followed by a Phase II trial to investigate Metablok‚Äôs efficacy at preventing inflammation related acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

**Cardiac Surgery-Associated Acute Kidney Injury**

Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents an additional challenge for patients recovering from cardiac surgery. AKI occurs in approximately 30% of patients that undergo cardiac bypass surgery with approximately 5-7% of patients requiring dialysis. For patients who recover from the need for dialysis or mild AKI, there is a greater likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease in future than those who did not have AKI.

Currently, no specific therapies exist to prevent AKI. Worldwide, there are over one million patients per year that have cardiac surgery procedures.¬†

Inflammation is known to contribute to AKI related to ischemia-reperfusion and other insults to the kidney that may occur in the course of cardiac surgery.¬†

Metablok¬†is a novel¬†therapeutic agent that may protect the kidneys and prevent AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

**About Arch Biopartners**

Arch Biopartners Inc. is a clinical stage company focused on the development of innovative technologies that have the potential to make a significant medical or commercial impact.¬†¬†Arch is developing a drug library, led by Metablok, to produce new drug candidates that inhibit organ inflammation caused via the DPEP-1 pathway.
