Trading penny stocks, by it's nature, is extremely volatile and you'd need to open/close positions really quickly to not get fucked. I think you're looking for arbitrage opportunities that don't exist.

I’m on my phone so explaining would take too much time. You need to educate yourself on it anyway so google it and read 20 articles at least. What you want are ETF’s. Just throw 30-100 bucks down on one here and there and watch dividends pile up for the next 30 years. Penny stocks are for people with high blood pressure, depression, irrresponsibly high risk tolerance, and who stare at their phone all day agonizing over minute price fluctuations.

14,WonkyWombat321,dvx0lyu,/r/pennystocks/comments/85deee/advice_for_a_passive_penny_stock_trader/dvx0lyu/,1,"Agree with some of the other comments that if you can't check your phone a few times a day then penny stocks may not be for you. For example I was in $HCEI when it went from .0005 to .0048 and then back to .0006 all in the same day. If I hadn't checked my phone I would have missed out on 900% returns (my actual return was lower because I didn't get out at the top). 

A lot of movement is completely unexpected and a lot hit a high in one day and then trickle down from there. But do what's right for you, if you have a passion for it you do you.

As for others, you need to have a schedule that enables you to check the tickers like every hour. Penny stocks can go from -20% to +20% in a single day. Setting triggers or limits is very tough because of this. So it's risky business. As for resources, I suggest signing up for a service that will send you hidden information and latest news. Most of these services will charge a monthly fee. But you can make millions in a few years or less if done right and with some good luck. ",2018-03-18
