12,Thoughts after trading for 7 Years,cw9sjr,invcht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cw9sjr/thoughts_after_trading_for_7_years/,218,90," 

I‚Äôve been trading for 7 years. I started when I was 17 studying the market, watching the tape, and pretty much having zero social life. The amount of sacrifice it takes to get good at this is absurd. I don‚Äôt mean make a couple trades a month good but having the mental capital to do this everyday for years is extremely difficult. 

Here‚Äôs a few big things I‚Äôve learned:  
 

**Trading is a privilege.** The majority of people struggle to have even $1000 in their savings and work from 9-5 daily. We can come into the market and pull a couple hundred or thousand out of thin air with a few hours of sitting at our desk. You should never take this idea of being able to be financially free for granted. Your account capital is nothing to play around with. You must have rules that you follow to protect your capital. If you don‚Äôt you are essentially disrespecting yourself and everyone who is working their ass off out there. Oh, I‚Äôll just throw a random bet on this stock and ‚ÄúHOPE‚Äù it goes up - your account balance will reflect your choices.

**Snake oil salesmen.** There‚Äôs a ton of trading communities &amp; shitty people willing to take a noob‚Äôs money in this industry. You can find a large amount of free information on the internet to help get started. Keep in mind, free information will only help you get started. The real information in trading that is going to exponentially shorten your learning curve is going to cost you. This is an industry where you can make a ton of money so no one is going to give you the real shit for free unless you get really lucky. Just being honest. If you are looking for a community to join, make sure you do your research and NEVER pay more than $50 a month. There‚Äôs communities out there charging $180 a month which is absolute bullshit. Also keep in mind, ‚Äúfree‚Äù communities are never actually free - someone is always selling you a trade ideas affiliate program or broker affiliates - or even worse they‚Äôre pumping to their audience, thus charging you.

**Tape reading.** The majority of your indicators &amp; technical analysis is bullshit. Not saying every indicator isn‚Äôt helpful, but your MACD and RSI isn‚Äôt going to tell you if someone is propping the bid or if there‚Äôs hidden selling occurring. Tape reading is ESSENTIAL. I‚Äôm not going to dive into it in this post because there is a ton to cover but maybe in a future post.

**Patience.** If you‚Äôre hoping to turn your $2,500 account into $500k in a year - quit now. Getting consistency good at trading is something that is going to take at the very least a year. I already know there‚Äôs gonna be a few people in the comments claiming to be a pro after 6mos but I know you‚Äôre just delusional or you haven‚Äôt been at it long enough to take some good losses and realize you aren‚Äôt good. It took me a year to ‚Äúget it‚Äù, 2 years to start applying it, and it took me 3 years to start trading consistently. 

There's so much I want to add to this post but I'm a bit tired at the moment - will do some more posts in the future.",2019-08-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cw9sjr/thoughts_after_trading_for_7_years/

Rahway, NJ, Aug. 27, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Spectacular Solar, Inc. (OTCPK: SPSO) is pleased to announce that the company has a signed a $1 million dollar contract with Farmplast, LLC for the engineering and installation of a 360-kilowatt solar project.  


Spectacular Solar CEO Doug Heck and CFO Antonio E. Perez both alluded to the company having a strong third quarter in last week‚Äôs earnings release and this seven-figure contract will contribute significantly to the bottom line of the quarter ending on Sept. 30.

‚ÄúThese projects don‚Äôt materialize out of thin air, rather they are the result of incredible synergy amongst the various teams in the Spectacular Solar family,‚Äù said Perez. ‚ÄúAs the company continues to show strong momentum and sustainable growth with each quarter being stronger than the last, we hope that our shareholders can see that our main focus is to build Spectacular Solar with a deliberate approach, which will subsequently deliver true and lasting shareholder value.‚Äù

The Parsippany, NJ-based Farmplast is the number one producer and supplier of industrial milk crates in the United States. In addition to owning 5-star reviews on Amazon, Farmplast is widely recognized for ‚ÄúBeing Green‚Äù in the production of its milk crates.

‚ÄúWhen Doug approached me about this opportunity, I knew it had the potential to be a great move for Farmplast,‚Äù said owner Mark Lomak. ‚ÄúNot only will the completion of this project provide significant financial benefits to my company, I can also take pride in the fact that Farmplast is committed to doing its part to protect the environment.‚Äù

Heck echoed Lomak‚Äôs sentiment about this venture.

‚ÄúI was excited about this 42,000-square foot project before I even sat down with Mark and five minutes into our conversation, I knew our engineers were going to come up with something great,‚Äù Heck said. ‚ÄúWhen I meet with people like Mark who are open to any and all possibilities, the end result usually carries an incredible ‚Äòwow factor‚Äô and that is definitely the case here.‚Äù",2019-08-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cw9a9j/spso_spectacular_solar_farmplast_agree_to_1/
