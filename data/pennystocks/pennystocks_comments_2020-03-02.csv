Learn to identify good companies and invest rather than trade. Wait for dips and while everything is dropping start buying in and cost averaging down. Buy with the intention of holding for minimum 1 year to qualify for long term capital gains rates and to give your money time to work for you. Once you get good at identifying good companies at good values you can start using 2 year leap calls to up the amount of return. Spend your time on the investor relations pages for a few companies. Read the quarterly earnings reports for as long back as you can. See where the company came from, if they actually meet their goals and what their plans for growth are.",2020-03-02

2020-03-03 10:13 ET - News Release

\- Flagship sales center for both new and used commercial and passenger Electric Vehicles  
\- A full suite of onsite services to also include insurance, financing, and vehicle registrations  
\- City of Qingdao to incorporate existing car sales activity at the site, which City of Qingdao has projected its annual revenues to ¥1 Billion RMB in 2020  
\- Ideanomics to leverage Grapevine to create new KOL marketing channels for China's EV market  


NEW YORK, March 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2736976-1&amp;h=151181375&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), is pleased to announce as follow up to our partnership with the City of Qingdao and in conjunction with our MEG Group subsidiary, Qingdao Mobile New Energy Vehicle Sales Co. Ltd., activities of its flagship sales, support, and maintenance center in the City of Qingdao.

[The 100,000 square meter (1Million square feet) facility will host a state-of-the-art sales and service center for new and used passenger and commercial Electric Vehicles (EV), and on-site financing, insurance, and vehicle registration services.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1098662/Qingdao_MEG_sales_center.html)

[""In addition to generating many new jobs in Qingdao, our world class sales and service center will feature a full end-to-end customer experience with financing, insurance, vehicle registration, and maintenance all under one roof"" said Dr. Bruno Wu, Chairman of Ideanomics. ""With a range of leading EV brands available on site, from our manufacturing alliance partners, our fleet customers will enjoy a competitive buying experience which focuses on education, test driving, and flexible financing programs to provide the vehicles required to meet their needs in an immersive environment unavailable anywhere else today"".](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1098662/Qingdao_MEG_sales_center.html)

[This new state-of-the-art center will assume the current vehicle sales and revenue activities at the site, which the City of Qingdao has committed to the Qingdao Mobile New Energy Vehicle Sales Co. Ltd. by injecting the existing business that they have projected to reach ¥1 Billion RMB (approx. $144M US) by year-end 2020 and grow to over ¥2 Billion RMB (approx. $288M US) in 2021, based on their 2019 actual turnover. The city's revenue projections for 2020 do not take into account any reduction in sales due to the impact of the coronavirus. Once Qingdao is established as its hub, MEG plans to set up several regional EV sales centers to provide nationwide service.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1098662/Qingdao_MEG_sales_center.html)

[MEG's EV hub will showcase leading electric vehicles, to include cars, vans, trucks, and buses, and will incorporate social media in support of the marketing strategies of its EV manufacturing partners by adding influencer and Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) marketing into its sales platform. Along with its strategic KOL platform, China-based partners such as People's Daily, Douyin, Tencent, and Kuaishou will help deliver powerful campaigns that will leverage the best of traditional and new media and help drive additional EV industry growth through increased audience awareness.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1098662/Qingdao_MEG_sales_center.html)

[In the past 5 years the rise of influencer marketing has effectively changed the way brands communicate their message to consumers. Consumers and businesses alike continue to gravitate towards these platforms to consume news, gain product knowledge, updates, reviews, and recommendations. Chinese consumers rely heavily on the opinions of KOLs as well as their own social networks.

**New Analyst Target Price $1.82** 

**Highlights**

   
Leadership position and strong order pipeline in a large addressable market. China – IDEX’s first target market – will be home to 143 million electric vehicles (\~57% of global stock) by 2030. This is \~62x the present stock of electric vehicles (2.3 million units) in China, suggesting that the market is poised for huge growth.

   
IDEX also plans to grow outside China, first in ASEAN nations (starting with Malaysia) and then globally. The company has a strong position in the market, reflected in its $2 billion order pipeline in China, of which \~$600 million is likely to be converted into revenue in CY20.
