1,mtmtrader,f8vnb1w,/r/pennystocks/comments/e2id44/trnx/f8vnb1w/,1,"Dividend is taken from the company's equity and is meant to benefit long(er) term investors, meaning you can just buy right before, collect a dividend, and then sell for profit (the market is never going to be that easy). 

For example if a company is giving a $0.20 dividend for every share and the stock closes the day before at $20, it would open the next day at $19.80.",2019-11-27
2,StockBreakoutPlays,f8vncmv,/r/pennystocks/comments/e2id44/trnx/f8vncmv/,1,"Theoretically, the value of both entities will equal the value of what they are at the time of dividend. Thus, TRNX will trade lower, and TRNF will make up the difference. However, TRNX is a diluting pig that continuously has to raise money to stay in business. This spinoff feels like a typical penny stock game to keep investors hopes up while getting them to pour more money into now, two stocks.

Keep in mind, it's the old MNGA stock. They've already completed 2 reverse splits this year. That chart is fugly. This may be an attempt to get a stock price that doesnt look so beat down after many reverse splits over the years. They need fresh investors to keep the scheme going.",2019-11-27
3,Lockerd,f8vnhyb,/r/pennystocks/comments/e2id44/trnx/f8vnhyb/,1,"I only speak for myself with this, I am not advising anyone to take me as the SOLE source of information.

But to me, this is worth it, and I might even buy back in on the dip when the 5th rolls around and everyone dumps their TRNX stock after getting their TRNF stock. 

Taronis Technologies has a working product, a building infrastructure, a promising potential if their product also eliminates pharmaceuticals in wastewater (still to be determined). They are a company showing a lot of growth in the next few years, the opening of their new fuels division also allows them to move assets previously costing them more money for holding in Technologies, into the new fuels spinoff, which will almost instantly increase their profits from simply moving these assets. 

TO ME, this is a company which has demonstrated a lot of growth potential, this is not me saying you should buy this just for the flip (which in of itself is worth getting while it's cheap), this is me saying TRNX in general is worth it.",2019-11-27

Today is generally agreed as the last totally safe date to secure it, but the Taronis IR team has indicated that you could purchase on or after record date up to the 4th or whenever the stock is distributed. 29th is record date, distribution is on or before the 5th so long as you hold the shares. You run the risk of it getting distributed early and missing out though if you don't lock it in.",2019-11-27
