Has two major drugs in pipeline.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Thermodox , phase 3. Heat activated encapsulated doxorubicin. Showed excellent results for combined RFA and Thermodox for hepatic tumors in phase 1/2. Supposed to report data this year. Originally failed badly several years ago but revised the heating protocol and has been showing great results.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Gen-1, phase 1-2. IL-12 DNA plasmid vector. In Phase 1.... Quietly updated hospital info on website to display Phase  2 hospitals, implying progression to Phase 2. Has a conference in first week of March to go over Phase 1 results. Would be expected to be strong results if they are silently moving to Phase 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Has a history of pumping in the past. Last year went up like 600-800% in one day with excellent Thermodox Phase 1-2 results.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a holder... Hoping for excellent results in the March conference.",2019-02-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ap8283/celsion_clsn/
