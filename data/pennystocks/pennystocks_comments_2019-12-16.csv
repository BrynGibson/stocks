31,StopLossedMyMarriage,fb6zwa7,/r/pennystocks/comments/ebl5nm/what_do_you_think_of_oncy/fb6zwa7/,1,It already moved above its 200 DMA so it pushed past its current resistance level if your going off charts. So you should have a new resistance level on it. Its ADX is nuetral. But I'm in agreement long term hold is probably not a good idea. I'd probably run a 10 day hold on it and drop it at that point if in the money. If it shows a downtrend drop it sooner.,2019-12-16
