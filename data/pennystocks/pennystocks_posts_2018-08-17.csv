I would love to learn more about it and how people do it get their tips, what they look for in a stock ect.. What is the best site to learn this?  What sites do they recommend as a source?

1,A walking dead or ready to rebound?,981r5o,BitBitWin,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/981r5o/a_walking_dead_or_ready_to_rebound/,5,1,"[Auris Medical is a clinical-stage biotech company developing therapeutics for neurotology and mental health supportive care.  The stock is down 85% since peaking in April at $1.81.](https://www.finstead.com/bite/Auris-Medical-EARS-stock-forecast-prediction-august-16-2018)  Keep in mind, the company generates a net loss of $3.1 million, and it hasn't produced a penny of revenue yet.  

Here is the progress Auris has made regarding its key development programs (coded AM):

* The company has requested FDA guidance on AM-111 development program;
* Top-line data from the second Phase 1 trial for AM-125 for Vertigo is expected in early October;
* The trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of AM-201 in co-administration with olanzapine is expected to start in early 2019;
* The company has two drugs that are in Phase three.

**The spike last April was caused by institutional buying; however, a number of short-sellers today is overwhelming. If the company does well next year, when the two Phase three drugs are due, there could be a major price surge.** ",2018-08-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/981r5o/a_walking_dead_or_ready_to_rebound/
2,What exactly are pennystocks?,981nmg,LearningKR,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/981nmg/what_exactly_are_pennystocks/,3,6,"This is mostly due to my curiosity. But what exactly are pennystocks?

I know the generic definition off wiki

&gt;Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.

&gt;In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines a penny stock as a security that trades below $5-per-share, is not listed on a national exchange, and fails to meet other specific criteria.[1] In the United Kingdom, stocks priced under £1 are called penny shares. 

However, in a more clear explanation, what is a pennystock? I dont anything regarding stocks and how business function. But what I do know is that every company is either a private or a public company. Private company, you cant buy or sell its stocks (atleast, the general public). while public companies, anyone can buy and sell its shares.

So are pennystocks public companies? same as how apple, microsoft, google, etc are?

in addition, how do these companies come about? how do they get up to speed? how do people fine these small companies? etc.
since these are very small companies, how do you get news regarding them and what they are doing?

any other info is greatly appreciated!",2018-08-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/981nmg/what_exactly_are_pennystocks/

This is a scam.  Outside of an absurdly huge reverse split, the stock will never go up to $1.  Or 10 cents.  Or 5 cents.
