During the CC no bad news was announced, but no good news was announced either. Regardless the stock tanked immediately thereafter. 

I think that the product is a very innovative engineering marvel that will be an excellent source of green energy. So I decided after watching it drop 16% that maybe Iâ€™d have a good buy-in price to pick up on the dip. Well it ended up dropping another 16% which totally sucks ass. 

I hate getting burned this badly on a trade but hey thatâ€™s what you get for playing with penny stocks amirite?
