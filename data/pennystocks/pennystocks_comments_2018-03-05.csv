I.e. make sure the company is growing, (not necessarily that the stock price is growing) make sure their business model is sound, see if they're engaging in disruptive behavior, make sure their industry and/or market segment is seeing growth, look at who is backing it, look at their 10Q, among other things.

RXMD met the growth test quite well, so I jumped on board. Today they just announced that they're about to add a third location. Watch what happens when their next 10Q comes out and formally documents their first profitable quarter.",2018-03-05

- Their industry as a whole is seeing very strong, rapid growth (try not getting hired in IT security.)
- Their business model is built around carving a strong market niche and being disruptive.
- They've got at least one industry heavyweight with an awesome CV on board, so unlikely to be any kind of scam or half-hearted attempt.
- They've already purchased a number of other small niche players, so this passes my growth test.
