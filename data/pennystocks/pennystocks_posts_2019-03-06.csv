COSTA MESA, Calif., March 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, and the first publicly traded company in America whose primary focus is production and selling of hemp-infused beer, announces its 4th distribution agreement for Major Hemp HIPA with Egizii Distributing Company (“Egizii”), tapping into the popular central and southern Illinois craft beer market.   


Egizii is a distributor of alcoholic beverages based in the capital of Springfield, serving all markets south of the Chicago metropolitan area.  Contained within this geographic region are a multitude of cities notable for their appreciation of craft beer, including Peoria, Bloomington, and Carbondale.  Egizii’s distribution territory also comprises a large concentration of college towns replete with vast numbers of university students, a population with expansive social networks that is particularly inclined towards imbibing hemp-infused beer.  The company has placed their initial order which is slated to arrive next week.

Sipp Industries has now signed three new distributors during the past month, and reports that Major Hemp HIPA is being eagerly sought out by existing distributors and retail locations that continue to place reorders.  In addition, new bars, restaurants and stores are regularly inquiring about becoming first-time customers.

Ted Jorgensen, President of wholly-owned subsidiary Major Hemp, stated, “We are very excited to begin working with Egizii, a rapidly growing beer distributor with hundreds of customers in their coverage area.  They tasted Major Hemp HIPA and immediately requested to begin carrying our beer to supply these crucial geographic regions in Illinois.  This is an exciting time for Sipp Industries as the demand and distribution channels for HIPA continue to blossom around the Midwest.”

The Company also reports that it has started another run of Major Hemp HIPA in order to replenish current distributors as well as increase the number of total locations serving the hemp-infused craft brew.  Jorgensen concluded, “We have now completely blanketed Missouri, Iowa and Illinois.  As our geographic pipeline continues to expand, Church Street Brewing has done a fantastic job supporting our growth and allowing us to produce fresh batches of the highest quality hemp beer on the market for our ever-growing list of distribution partners.”

Major Hemp HIPA has now been placed in over 100 unique locations since October including liquor store chains, retail stores, pubs and restaurants throughout the Midwest.  This number is expected to grow progressively into the popular beer drinking months in Spring and Summer.

Everyone always asks ""How do you guys find out about these things before they take off"", and then proceed to ignore posts trying to help people ""find these things before they take off"". This thing is likely headed for pennies, maybe even today. The purchasing entity (LTN) is an established company seeking to use VSCH as a shell. 

Here's an excellent DD compilation. 

Good Luck. Have an exit strategy!
