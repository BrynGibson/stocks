1,$BIOAQ,bkcyl3,reeferlachiefer,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bkcyl3/bioaq/,0,6,"Hello. Here is some technical analysis i have done on BIOAQ. I know it is delisted but many of the fundamentals such as this should have already been a done deal and shareholders paid out or whatever.

To be honest i don't care what a stock is about; if i see a longing opportunity im taking it.

Some technical analysis that I am seeing is an increasing amount of volume as the price got lower as shown by the volume candles on the bottom. It makes zero sense to short as buyers will inevitably create a wall. (""the price is too good not to buy this low"")

The short sellers will have to close their position which is a ""buy"" while the fomo buyers move the price up.

Over 20% in the last few months. That's not a dead stock.

We have had a golden cross on lower time frames. I am just buying in right now, and will look to profit 75% at $2.00 where the weekly 200 MA is headed

2,Long term confidence in CHK?,bkccxv,mothCult,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bkccxv/long_term_confidence_in_chk/,16,7,"I bought in around $2.00. Just a few share. The price fluctuates between 2 and 3 dollars over the weeks and I don't know if I should pick the constant buy low sell high method or if I should make a bigger investment in them. 

I was thinking of buying a few more shares and bunkering down for the long haul. 

Reading their reports and news articles it sounds like they're on a path of moderate success. Nothing compared to their price around 7 years ago (29 dollars a share). 

I was hoping to get someone else thoughts on this, thanks in advance.

3,Will partially selling shares of a stock count as a day trade?,bk42qm,Imshmacked21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bk42qm/will_partially_selling_shares_of_a_stock_count_as/,1,1,"Hey guys, quick question here and I apologize if it is a stupid question but I‚Äôm new to day trading and had a question. Now as many of you know, you are allowed a maximum of three day trades on robinhood in a 5 trading day period. My question is, if I purchased lets say 100 shares of stock XYZ during a day and later sold 99 shares on the same day would that count as a day trade?

6,MGON low float cannabis ticker great DUE DILIGENCE here!,bka95n,sumbal222,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bka95n/mgon_low_float_cannabis_ticker_great_due/,37,15," MGON is a rarity as they simply have not and do not dilute. They previously stated no dilution and no reverse split. The kept the Authorized Shares (AS) for the common shares to remain at 200 million shares and increased/created preferred shares of 54 million:

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to think that any consummation of deals and acquisitions will be done through the use of preferred shares. So far, I think the market is just a little slow in realizing what has already been quietly released or I challenge anyone to show me another stock at this price with an OS of under 200 million shares with all of this under it:

MGON Outstanding Shares (OS) = 196,095,060 Shares

MGON Authorized Shares (AS) = 200,000,000 Shares

8,$CREX Possible Break Out Between 5/3 and 5/10,bk9pwj,ashimara,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bk9pwj/crex_possible_break_out_between_53_and_510/,1,2,"I mentioned $CREX last month before their annual report.  There was a very short but nice spike (mostly after hours and pre-market). It was followed by a slow, low volume price decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

$CREX Q1 ER is May 9th and should be much better than the last report.  \[They are projecting $18M to $20M in their first 2 quarters.\]( [https://investors.cri.com/2019-03-28-Creative-Realities-announces-FY18-and-4Q18-financial-results](https://investors.cri.com/2019-03-28-Creative-Realities-announces-FY18-and-4Q18-financial-results) )  If they hit $8 or 9M+ for Q1 their year over year growth will be at 100%+. They are currently trading like a negative revenue, static growth company -  Price/Sales (TTM)0.95xPrice/Book (MRQ)1.3x .  Furthermore, because of their stock ownership structure, there is a good chance that this may trade like a tiny float stock with possibilities of huge upside with high volume.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this stock should be in the $4 to $6 range either after Q1 ER or Q2 ER.  As of this post it is trading in the $2.30 to $2.70 range. 

&amp;#x200B;

As always play smart, the stock can go to very low volume, very quickly (you get stuck).  I think today is early enough to load and take advantage of an ER run-up or possible major catalyst in ER.  Please note that you may have to be patient to play this one correctly.

The recently released 2018 year-end results¬† for Hannover House, Inc. (OTC: HHSE) show a change in revenue recognition for the 25-year-old home video and media distribution company. In response to declining ""physical"" sales (of actual DVD and BluRay units), Hannover House has implemented a revenue reserver hold-back of eighty percent (80%), which is a far more conservative reserve than any of the major studios or competitive independent distributors. As a result of this revenue reserve, Hannover House deferred the recognition of $210,410 in shipped videos that, under previous accounting procedures, would have been immediately recognized as revenues. Hannover House had no revenue reserves held-back for the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2018, but did reserve $69,403 during the 1st quarter of 2018, representing twenty percent (20%) of the company's DVD and BluRay shipments for that quarter.¬†

¬† ¬†""We see the change in revenue recognition as one of the steps towards our cash-only accounting goal,"" said Hannover House C.E.O. Eric Parkinson.¬† ""In the past, the company would recognize between 75% and 100% of home video sales, which often required a later write-down if unsold merchandise returns exceeded our reserves. This became problematic, especially in respect to year-to-year reporting, in which returns during a specific calendar year could have an impact later against revenues for the following year. By implementing a very large revenue reserve, we are better able to recognize the operational benefits of retail sales as they occur, as opposed to as they are initially shipped.""

¬† ¬†Hannover House, Inc. is a Wyoming-based corporation, and is also the parent company of Medallion Releasing, Inc. and Bookworks,Inc., both Arkansas domiciled entities. The company is currently trading on the OTC Pinksheets markets, but plans to file a Form 10 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to enable the stock to be traded as an OTC: QB equity.¬† 

¬† ¬†Changes in accounting procedures and revenue recognition have been implemented in order to better conform to auditing procedures that Hannover House is now following. Hannover House was formed in 1993 as Truman Press, Inc., a book publishing company. The company added DVDs as a product line in 2002 and has since released over 450 titles. In December, 2009, Truman Press, Inc., dba ""Hannover House"" merged with Wyoming real estate company Target Development Group, Inc. in a transaction that resulted in Hannover House gaining both a public company listing as well as control of the combined companies. In April of 2012, after a thorough review of the company's application and history, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the formal name change of the corporation to: ""Hannover House, Inc."" and the ticker symbol change to:¬† ""HHSE.""",2019-05-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bk7obb/hhse_changes_in_revenue_recognition_at_hannover/
