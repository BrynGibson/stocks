Kinda unnerving though because of all the glitches and problems RH has had lately.. and how untraditional of a banking service it is. 3% though is so much better than what I have now so why not try it,2018-12-14
6,MonteInVirginia,ebrgqqe,/r/pennystocks/comments/a625yi/simple_questions_december_14_2018/ebrgqqe/,1,"Fellow LODE bag holders, what is your strategy? Unlike tech companies or other sectors LODE is literally sitting on their assets. They reduced debt by selling property and from what I understand are ready to begin mining anytime. Iâ€™m fine holding long if this can be viewed as a hedge against a bear market but I donâ€™t want to be caught in an unrealistic waiting game. Overall, thus far it was a FOMO mistake. I had an opportunity to take profit but got greedy. Iâ€™m at a 0.23 average so Iâ€™m down ~35%. Their next earnings is 2/20. Is this the type of stock that will have another run around earnings or is all the news in the past and waiting for raw mining results will be the real catalyst? Iâ€™ve always heard precious metals are good to have in a down market so Iâ€™m debating about my strategy. Cut and run or hold and hedge? Take my loss or wait patiently because unlike other companies itâ€™s assets and product will remain significant?",2018-12-14
