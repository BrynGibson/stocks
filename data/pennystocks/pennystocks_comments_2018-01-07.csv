12,Talonx4,dsc1iaf,/r/pennystocks/comments/7osm81/a_case_for_pntv/dsc1iaf/,1,"I received a pm from a new trader asking what I meant by 52 week support pattern.  

Putting it simply, most stocks have a support and resistance level.  Resistance is where the investors deem the stock to be over valued.  It's a level where the stock really can't go above without a major push.  You will usually see them around big round numbers. When you see that stock that always gets to $1.98 but never crosses $2.  We call this resistance.  BTW, for those of you new traders, when it crosses, it will usually gain very fast.  

Support is levels that investors deem the price is a deal.  So they buy in.  Once a stock reaches a certain point, investors can deem it undervalued or ""as low as it will go so to speak.  You can identify it on a chart by finding where the stock never gets lower than that price point.   And for new traders, if a stock goes below support, watch out as it will usually crash quickly.

Low cost airline company, they are looking to take out Westjet or Air Canada's monopolies with ultra low cost flights by avoiding main terminals.  Under 100 dollar flights, starting outside of Vancouver and they have a 5 year action plan to acquire more planes.

They launch in June but you can invest now.  I got in at .56 on the OTC, currently it is up to .64.  Probably will be very volatile for a while because there won't be real news until June.  So maybe you can get in lower.  But I expect it to go to at least 3 dollars end of year, and potentially 20-30 dollars in next five if they succeed.",2018-01-07
