&amp;#x200B;

If you remember we had an even bigger rally at the end of 2017. Is this rally will continue? I will share my thoughts on the main three stocks: $PXS $DCIX $TOPS

&amp;#x200B;

Watch video: [https://youtu.be/7u5I43O98oU](https://youtu.be/7u5I43O98oU)

&amp;#x200B;

In the video, I will discuss my $PXS trade which turned out to be a loser and will explain why this happened even when I got my position opened around 2$ mark.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, you will find out trading price levels I am interested to trade next week by going short.

&amp;#x200B;

As well I included some tips about diluted stocks and why you should be aware if you trade one and how to easily spot these diluted stocks simply by looking at the price chart.

9,Thinking outside the box with GHG (Global Hemp Group),9u4po2,justbeaguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9u4po2/thinking_outside_the_box_with_ghg_global_hemp/,1,18,"Everyone and their mothers got rich off of marijuana stocks over the last year. I did not touch a single stock while everyone else was catching it, because I was paying attention to everything else going on around it. 

You have to remember there are really rich people out there that invest their money, where they see fit. 

They do not care who is winning right now, they care about who prove themselves over the course of months and years. Current billionarwa do not get rich by jumping on every single small cannabis stock that comes out. They patiently wait, and give their money to the ones who can go through hell, and survive. 

Recreational cannabis in Canada has not gone as smoothly as everyone has thought. Provinces do not have enough Supply to meet their demand, and many people feel it was rushed through legalization for political reasons. 

I tend to agree. My opinion is, cannabis is the best medicine on planet Earth. It is unethical to advertise it as recreational fun, but the damage is done. 

There is no other medicine on Earth that works as well as cannabis when it comes to anxiety and stress. It is going to be around forever, but not everyone selling it will be. 

Global hemp group has not rushed to cash in. They are literally doing the opposite. They're taking their time, and proceeding with caution every step of the way. They work with companies such as hempsmart in America, to carve out their own little niche space. They're in no rush to the top. 

Companies like this make their way to the top eventually. That is why every time I stocks make money, I sell some and load up on this for the long run. 

Here are a few other things to think about:

Medical cannabis has been available in British Columbia for a very long time. Their headquarters are located in British Columbia. They're working closely with states in America (Oregon and Washington I believe) who share the same visions as them. When you have multiple companies, in multiple areas, working in unison as a team good things happen. They are slowly and steadily climbing the mountain. They position themselves for the long term, to receive big money from smart people, either in buy outs, or gigantic financial investments to help them. 

It rains a lot in British Columbia. Rain helps cannabis grow faster. Simple science will indicate that due to their location, they will have an advantage when it comes to growing cannabis. I believe it rains heavily and places like Oregon and Washington as well. These people are smart enough to invest in areas that give them a competitive advantage. 

it's also important to look at the type of land they grow their product on. When they discuss the organic process , that includes the fields cannabis grows in. If you decide to grow cannabis an old table fields that were once populated with Monsanto or GMO seeds, you will not have a naturally organic product. This may mean nothing to you, but there is a huge Market of rich people who spend their hard-earned money on ""non GMO products."" That is another Market they can take over. 

Finally, cannabis is not federally legal in America, but I believe it's close. When it does become legal, you better believe there are rich businessmen and famous celebrities ready to unload and join the market. Snoop Dogg, Dan Bilzerian, Joe Rogan, even Bill Gates are the type of people who could potentially avoid a new startup, and invest heavily in a small Canadian company like GHG which is already established routes across America. There's also a gentleman by the name of Jeff Bezos who runs a fairly successful company. he also has headquarters set up in British Columbia, Washington, and possible Oregon as well. You better believe once it's federally legal, he could jump into this business as well.

But everything I said above is just hearsay, and predictions. Some of it could happen, and some of it could not. But for $0.08 a share, I'm willing to take that risk. I'm willing to spend $100 on5 custom made t-shirts that read ""invest in GPHPF:US"" and tell everyone I know about it. 

I'd be willing to spend $1,000, on a hundred t-shirts, and give them to every redditor who proves they have invested $500 of their own money in the stock as well. Because of every redditor did that who read this post, the stock would simply go up. It's called investing in yourself, while working as a team. 


That's why I choose to invest in the hemp company no one else does. Well everyone is cashing in and celebrating the recreational weed earnings, I will patiently wait for the more economic reasons to develop naturally.
