LAS VEGAS, Dec. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – 808 Renewable Energy Corporation (OTC: RNWR) (“the Company”) is pleased to announce the completion of its merger with Cool Events, LLC.  


The merger between 808 Renewable Energy and Cool Events redirects the Company’s business model to focus on the rapidly growing events industry. William Spata assumes the position of CEO and director; Brogg Sterrett is COO and director; and Valerie Spata is human resources manager.

Cool Events brings a seasoned management team with 35 years of combined experience in operating experiential events, including obstacle course races, running races, experiential family events and other competitive events. The team at Cool Events produced over 120 events in 2018 between its five wildly successful brands which include: Terrain Race, Bubble Run, Foam Glow, Blacklight Run and Blacklight Slide. Bubble Run is the largest daytime 5K run in the country; Foam Glow is currently the largest nighttime 5K run in the country; Blacklight Slide is the first and only 5-story blacklight-lit neon glowing waterslide; and Terrain Race is the fastest-growing obstacle course race for all ages and athletic abilities.

It is estimated the outside events business will generate over $900 million in ticket sales in America in 2019. Based on its current model, management expects the emerging Company will produce over 120 events across America in 2019 and gross over $22 million in revenue.

William Spata, CEO of Cool Events, commented, “I have a high-level confidence that Cool Events will be one of the largest conglomerates of experiential events in the United States. My intent is to fully deploy our proprietary marketing systems and our operational know-how to scale not only the number of events but the participation levels to substantially higher levels on a per-event basis. We have already witnessed the power of these principles and have doubled or, in one instance, tripled, the number of participants thanks, in part, to our digital ad efforts.”

The Cool Events brands generated over $22 million in gross revenues for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017. Cool Events is reporting gross assets in excess of $4 million. The assets consist primarily of cash, merchandise and equipment. Estimated liabilities are represented to be no more than $700,000, excluding any deferred revenue liabilities. All financial statements provided by Cool Events are unaudited and will be subject to adjustments based upon the requirements of GAAP.

Cool Events is committed to dedicating its events to the local community, families and children. Cool Events has aligned itself with Children’s Miracle Network, Special Olympics, Ronald McDonald House Charities and Childhood Cancer Awareness. It has donated more than $1 million to Phoenix Children’s Hospital/Children’s Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House Charities, Special Olympics, Boys and Girls Club and many more over the years.

With this completed merger, the Company now has 207,075,187 common shares issued and outstanding and 6,993,338 that are deposited in DTCC. The Company is not planning a reverse stock split and will file all necessary documents to become current with OTC Markets. The Company will also take the necessary corporate actions to change the name to Cool Events, Inc.

&amp;#x200B;

SRMX’s Tri Cascade subsidiary is presenting the new Smart Home industry with **embedded Voice-Activated technology,** plus the new **B2B Microsoft Azure IoT Multi-Tenant Cloud management system**. We are taking ""Smart Devices"" to a whole new level – through **i.VA (Intelligent Voice Assistant)** – which, along with our various Smart home products, will deliver a cord cutting experience, transforming any house into its own smart device! See below for a message from our CEO, Max Li.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dear Shareholder,**

**SRMX’s Tri Cascade Operation is going “big time” in the most prestigiousconsumer electronics show in the world. Let me explain why this is so good for you, and our future together. I hope you will join us to say hello.**

**WHAT IS “IoT”** **- Internet of Things** **–** **and why does it matter to you?**

“Internet of Things” is the new way of connecting all devices to the Internet and using the Internet as a totally integrated global device communication network.

This goes beyond Smart phones, tablets, and laptops etc. It includes a whole newgeneration of other “Smart” devices now entering the market. Smart devices use the Internet to upload instructions on how to behave. They experience data through the information Cloud that you are hearing more about. They process that information through a data analysis algorithm to predict the Smart results they need. As you have been hearing about in the news, consumers are increasingly able to control and monitor more of our immediate environment through voice command (and other future types of commands). This will free up our time to enjoy the better things in life by making so many of the “things” in your life carry out tasksthe way you want or need.

In today’s Smart World, many businesses are using Wi-Fi to connect Smart devices to a router. Users need to use a phone app internet connection to communicate with the Cloud and access the Smart device. But, there is a problem with this present method that is going to be solved by a new approach. Tri Cascade is at the leading edge of this change.

Presently, when you purchase a number of Smart devices and attach them your house, such as thermostat, light switches and more, they can’t be conveniently betaken with you when you move, yet they operate from your router that you do take with you. This creates a headache for the new owners and is a waste of money for you. This is going to become an increasing problem as more people experience this situation with the spread of Smart Homes and devices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tri Cascade has the Solution!**

Tri Cascade is now able to provide a true business-to-business (B2B) service to create a seamless Smart City, Smart Neighborhood Development or hospitality management possible. We are deploying the Microsoft Azure Multi-Tenant Cloud with revolutionary new Tri Cascade system setup architecture in our breakthrough solutions. The Tri Cascade Smart System is integrated within the property, so that the home owner or building management can easily resell or rent out the property to others as a functioning Smart House or Smart Building, without having to take down and re-install the system.

By harnessing telecom companies’ NB IoT networks (Narrowband Internet of Things), Tri Cascade’s proprietary system becomes a “self-Internet” that is anindependent platform. We don’t need a system connection to any router, and the NB IoT connective will always remain within the system even when the property is vacant.

Tri Cascade is now testing the NB IoT network approach with a major telecom provider by bringing our Smart devices to a major U.S. city for beta testing. We are proving that our network connectivity, Cloud management and the telecom network all work seamlessly, and that all applicable regulatory certifications are obtained. We will then roll out the Tri Cascade system to the marketplace.

**If you, as a shareholder, come to see us at the CES in Las Vegas, you will see first- hand that OTC:SRMX is an exciting way for the investing public to participate at the leading edge of a powerful new wave coming to homes and communities across North America and beyond.**

**Thank you for your interest in OTC:SRMX. Please let us know that you are planning to drop by, so that I can be there to thank you in person for being part of the OTC:SRMX team.**

**Max Li, CEO**

Earth Science Tech, Inc. (ETST) Reports Positive Results from Hygee™ Pre-launch Testing

DORAL, Florida, Dec. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST) (“ETST"" or the “Company""), an innovative biotech company focused on the cannabidiol (CBD), nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields, medical devices, and research and development, today announces successful in vitro analyses of gynecological samples collected using its new Hygee™ medical device.

Hygee™ is a discreet, wearable medical device that enables a woman to anonymously test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As previously announced, samples collected by the Hygee™ device are tested by Procréa. In pre-launch testing at the labs, molecular diagnostic assays successfully identified the presence of Chlamydia in test subjects, confirming earlier testing results in a cohort of more than 500 women.

ETST’s President, Director and Chairman Nickolas S. Tabraue states, “We are pleased to announce positive testing in the pre-launch phase of Hygee™, and would like to thank our carefully selected partners, Procréa, for a job well done. They are a part of the guarantee of our success.”

ETST is on track to launch Hygee™ in early 2019. The Company plans to market the product through its established distribution channels, mentioned in November, thanks to Dermagate’s ISO 13485:2013 certification.

“Hygee™ is an incredible innovation, and we have partners from many countries waiting to market the device,” stated ETST CEO and Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Michel Aubé. “This is only the beginning of realizing the potential of this unique device, and we look forward to updating our shareholders on our progress.”

In its first iteration, Hygee™ will be marketed as an at-home test for chlamydia; however, R&amp;D efforts currently underway indicate that Hygee™ will soon be certified for gonorrhea testing as well.
