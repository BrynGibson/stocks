### When to use a Watch-list: An investor, for example, may be interested in purchasing stocks in a particular sector. But if that sector is generally overvalued, it may offer few stocks that are attractively priced. An investor could create a list of all the stocks in that sector that would track various [valuation](https://www.transparenttraders.me/search/label/Free%20Stock%20Course?&amp;max-results=10) measures, including ratios such as trailing [price-to-earnings](https://www.transparenttraders.me/search/label/Free%20Stock%20Course?&amp;max-results=10), price-to-sales, price-to-book, among others. When a company on the list met a specified valuation criterion, such as a PE ratio less than 15, he or she would then know that this stock was a possible candidate for investment. Many investment-oriented websites allow visitors to create watch-lists online.",2019-04-16

You see what these attorneys do is they jump on anything that drops a substantial amount and throw out useless allegations hoping it drops even further and that people who were victims to said drop will come to them to sue. Either way it’s always a win win for them with them losing nothing.,2019-04-16

Their last earnings met EPS but their revenue was low.  They're operating pretty conservatively, but their product is in a good place and they have quite a few irons in the fire.  That coupled with extremely low debt makes me think they'll be ~$4 by end of year.  Potentially higher depending on how the contract in Washington DC goes and whether they can get a foothold in New Zealand as planned.",2019-04-16
