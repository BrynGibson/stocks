 **Stick a fork in BIOAQ's common shares. They are DONE.**

 Anyone holding the common shares when FINRA (who has been notified by  PwC) will lose 100% of their investment. Assuming they have a chance to  sell, of course. FINRA could decide to delete the ticker at any time from this point forward.  ",2019-03-12

Why did you buy? Why did you buy before close.. they were already up, are you expecting another surge tomorrow? You're value being up one penny just means someone WAS willing to buy for that much at the end of the day. You will see a lot of manipulation in share price. People will sell small amounts of stock for higher or lower than the actual price people are buying at. The level 2 is your friend. I assume you're using RH by your history but with 4 shares what are you expecting to make ie. What is your exit plan. These stocks dip unless you see something magnificent I wouldn't buy sh** while it's going up more than 20% .

Pros: Faster and easier than filing for an IPO. Con: No influx of money. In this case, Vitality wanted to become a public entity but essentially decided its best course of action was to acquire a controlling share of a public company, in this case it was Livewell. So now, anyone who owns the private stock in will likely be able to trade their private stock for the public stock in Livewell. At the same time, Vitality will be brought into Livewell. This is an oversimplification of course. What does this mean for Livewell stock? You're guess is as good as mine. Will they buy back stock which would push the stock up, will they dilute the stock which would push it down, or some third option? Livewell will become bigger which hopefully means more revenue which would be good. There are also factors in play we don't know about that could hurt or help the valuation.
