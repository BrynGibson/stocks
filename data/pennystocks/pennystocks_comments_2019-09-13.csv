Either they will bottom out and go bankrupt, or this stock will make a huge turn upwards. I am personally  betting on the latter as I have been following what the company is doing over the last 2 years. They have made huge investments in infrastructure that should see a very nice ROI. They announced their entry into bioplastics and pre rolled smokable hemp in the last 2 weeks. Shares selling at around .0142 makes them a low risk high reward in my opinion. You are able to purchase massive amounts of shares at this point without risking too much capital. For example: if you purchase 50,000 shares it will cost you around 700.00$. When the stock goes up that minuscule investment will pay out massively. If the share price begins to raise to level of competing businesses at say around 20$/ share you will have 1,000,000 in profit. This is just my take on it. Take it with a grain of salt.",2019-09-13
