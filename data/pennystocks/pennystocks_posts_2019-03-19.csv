29,EAM Solar ASA (EAM.OL) DD,b2z1up,CaptTEM,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b2z1up/eam_solar_asa_eamol_dd/,4,0," 

Here is a unique case that i think is very interesting!

**EAM Solar - Judgments in early 2019!**

*04.09.2018 at 12:06*

EAM went into stock exchange in 2013 and raised 220 million NOK in a private placement to buy solar power plants in Italy. The solar power plants would be very profitable because the Italian state would provide tariff agreements with fixed prices for the ""green"" stream for 20 years.

Eam Solar bought for about 350 million NOK (value about 950 Million NOK, the rest was transferred debt) a package solution with 31 solar power plants from a company called Avelos, which is the subsidiary of Luxembourg's Enovos and Swiss Avelar.

Shortly after the purchase of the solar parks, it emerged from the Italian authorities (who had also purchased solar parks from Avelos) that the salesmen in Aveleos were under investigation and that documents on plant parts and collective agreements for the solar power plants were forged. The documents were faked so that the solar power plants were within the requirements to obtain the lucrative collective agreements with the Italian state. In other words, both the Italian authorities and EAM Solar had been swindled and the solar power plants' collective agreements were withdrawn.

Eam Solar has since been in many legal processes and the share value has gone from over 100NOK to under 20NOK at the lowest. The company is valued today (04.09.2018) on the Oslo Stock Exchange at approximately NOK 240 million (NOK 34 per share)

EAM Solar requires over 2.5 billion in connection with the fraud, money back, lost revenue, tort and sting, etc. And all information available indicates that they have very good chances of winning the trial. If they win 2 billion, the share price could go from NOK30 to NOK300-400, ie a return of several hundred percents from today's price.

Since the court cases have started, all sub-cases and judgments have gone to EAM Solar's favor and it probably also helps that the final criminal case is convicted in Italy, as the Italian state was also scammed. In the case against the state, two of the leaders acknowledged in aveleo's criminal liability and entered into a 10-month prison sentence.

There have been several indicators that EAM has a strong case. In the summer of 2017, EAM made an agreement with Therium Litigation Finance, a strong company that is the world leader in ""litigation funding"", which thus finances and supports companies in eam's position against participating in the compensation claim if the company wins. The agreement itself implies that EAM receives EUR 2.3 million between 2017 and 2019, divided into three annual optional payments of approximately EUR 775k. Therium will receive the invested amount as well as x 3 the amount invested if EAM wins (about 5-10% of the claim), and it is worth noting that it is ONLY if EAM Solar wins that Therium gets some of their money back. This has ensured that EAM solar has enough capital to keep the trials going until it is finished (some feared EAM would go bankrupt due to the cost of court proceedings). Not least, this is a strong indicator that EAM has a very good cause. Therium has won 75% of everything they have involved in. In total, the repayment to Therium amounts to 88 million NOK, and this is estimated to be between 5% -10% of the total claim. If one is to believe the lawyers in Therium, it is likely that EAM wins somewhere between 880-1760 million NOK, 129-258 NOK equity per share.

The Italian courts have, in the wording of the court orders, said that EAM solar ER is a victim of fraud and that counterparties are financially responsible (avelos, enovos, breeds). A judgment is expected in the first instance late 2018, probably out in 2019. For me, this looks like 2 + 2 where the question is how long and how much compensation.

There is also seizure of 33million EUR (about 310 million NOK) by the top managers of the company who made the fraud. Enovos and Avalar did not seize funds because the court considers these companies to be so liquid that there is no risk that they cannot afford to pay any compensation. My assessment is that this is a strong indicator of victory. In order for the court to judge the arrest of  33 million EUR , the guilty matter to the counterparty must be very little doubt. I think that arresting 33 million EUR is almost a ""punishment"" in itself, and one must be ""innocent to the contrary"". My assessment is therefore that the court is probably not in any doubt about guilt, perhaps it has already been decided that EAM wins and that further court proceedings deal with punishment/compensation sum.

This shines as the chance of time in my eyes. If they do not get their entire claim, it is almost unthinkable that they will not get the money back for the power plants that are affected by the fraud. And that amount in itself is the more a market value of EAM today.

I also know that the Italian judiciary is one of the slowest in Europe and that its history is characterized by corruption. After a judgment, it can be appealed, and then again go to the Supreme Court.

The ownership and board of EAM are also boasting. For example, where the largest investor is Sundt AS, with Leiv Askvig in the lead (didn't he take out 78 million NOK in bonuses this year?). Canica AS - Stein Erik Hagen (Rimi Garden) is the second largest investor.

Insiders in EAM also own a lot in the company. For example, CEO Viktor E. Jacobsen owns 28% of EAM Solar Park Management. EAM solar park management has 650 000 shares in EAM Solar ASA.

From eamsolar.no:

«To the extent permitted by applicable law by company laws declared that the entire annual surplus shall be distributed as dividends to its shareholders. Changes to or exemptions from this article requires the support of at least nine-tenths of the votes cast and of the share capital represented at the general meeting.

EAM Solar is currently valued at 200 million, they have arrested in excess of 310 million, have extremely good chances of getting the claim of 2bn, with any interest.

Excerpts:

The investment company Therium guarantees half of EAM Solar's bills when they sue the sellers of 31 solar power plants in Italy. If they win, the Therium will get the four-way back. Internationally, we have considered more than 1,200 cases in recent years, and we have only invested in less than 100 of them. So far, we have won or abandoned seven out of ten cases we have involved in, says general manager Henrik Berg of Therium Nordic. CEO Viktor Jakobsen at EAM Solar says that the company itself could fund the lawsuit, but that this reduces the financial risk and allows them to increase the pressure on the sellers - the major companies Enovos and Avelar - which they demand at least 250 million in compensation. (FEW)

The judges in Milan have condemned that enovos and breeds cannot be irresponsible to the fraud to aveleos, as in practice it is a single purpose vehicle. This means that EAM can claim compensation from, for example, Enovo's alone.

In the arbitration case, the parties must submit their latest arguments in September with the deadline for a reply in November. A judgment is expected by the end of February 2019.

In the criminal case, the last testimony is late autumn 2018, Oct / Nov and judgment in the Criminal case is expected at first instance 2-3 months after the last witness hearing.

In other words, great news comes right in the New Year!

Here is an overview of the issues as of Aug 2017:

1. Criminal proceedings concerning contractual fraud, in the Criminal Court of Milan

(Italy)

2. SPA annulment, in the Arbitration Court of Milan (Italy)

3. Criminal complaint with civil action against Encevo S.A. Group (formerly known

as Enovos International S.A. Group), and managing directors in Encevo S.A., in

the Criminal Court of Luxembourg (Luxembourg)

4. Breach of standstill proceedings against Aveleos S.A., in the Civil Court of

Luxembourg (Luxembourg)

5. Defamation case - allegations of the false complaint to be tried in Luxembourg

District Court (Luxembourg)

6. Financial restructuring and voluntary liquidation plan for the criminally indicted

SPVs, in the Bankruptcy Court of Milan (Italy)

7. Land lease proceedings in the Civil Courts of Bari and

**EAM Solar - Few weeks to judgment in arbitration and criminal cases!**

*05.01.2019 at 21:28*

Thoughts on the amounts.

EAM requires a total of around +/- 3 billion NOK. So 441 NOK per share.

Based on the agreement with Therium, Therium's repayment of 88 Million NOK is described as about 5-10% of the total compensation expected. That is, 880 million NOK - 1760 million NOK. This is another conservative estimate, for contractual purposes.

Arbitration: (Cancellation of SPA) The value of the SPA is approximately 950 million, where EAM paid 350 million NOK cash and the rest was transferred as debt to the power plants.

Criminal case: the seizure of 33M EUR, but should not be seen as a limitation on how much EAM could get.

Civil litigation: likely to settle when eam wins arbitration and criminal case, hard to say anything about amounts here, but lost revenue still constitutes a large sum of this requirement. Lost revenue must be proven, and for EAM's part, this is easy as the FIT contracts should have a fixed price for the sale of electricity. There are hundreds of millions.

We also have default interest here which is also important, which I think is 6-7%.

What is worth noting is that EAM will probably get its replacement piece by piece and split as the cases are judged. Therefore, it is not necessarily smart to sell their entire position when EAM wins the first case.

The store is in all cases the amounts, given the EAM stock market value of just under 230 million NOK.

**11/01-2019 07:00:00: (EAM.OAX) EAM Solar ASA: Legal status update**

*11 January 2019* 

As previously announced in the quarterly report for the third quarter, The company received in February 2018 a summons for allegedly false and misleading statements filed by Aveleos SA in Luxembourg in conjunction with the statements. EAM made in its third-quarter report 2017, where the Company made a provision for impairment on the receivables against Aveleos SA and explained the reasons for such impairment. The counterparty has twice asked for a postponement of the proceedings and the first hearing took place on 11 October 2018. There was not enough time to finalize the hearing and it was therefore rescheduled for 12

November 2018. On 12 November the counterparty asked for yet another postponement and a new hearing was scheduled and took place on 3 December 2018. 

Yesterday the Company received the ruling of the District Court of Luxembourg

where it made the following statements:

They declare themselves territorially incompetent to hear the requested

conservatory measures in respect of the subpoena,

They declare inadmissibility of the alternative request made by Aveleos at

hearing on 3 December 2018,

They reject the request of Aveleos SA on the basis of Article 240 of the new

Code of Civil Procedure,

They condemn Aveleos SA to pay to EAM Solar ASA EUR 1,500, and

They let the costs of the case be borne by Aveleos SA

The criminal case is now in its final stages with closing arguments by the

different parties. Further hearings have been scheduled and a verdict in the

first instance may happen as early as the first quarter 2019, this is however

uncertain.

Sorry for the newbie question, but are these 1 Year Targets just useless?  Does anyone else use them when they do their DD? Is it low because there's no analysts, or something?
