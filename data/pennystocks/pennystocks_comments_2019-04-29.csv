This is from their April 2 8K (their own words). I'd say their goose is cooked.

&amp;#x200B;

""On April 1, 2019, the Company failed to make an approximately $7 million in aggregate principal payments with respect to the Tranche A Term Borrowings and the Tranche B Term Borrowings (each as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement), that was due on April 1, 2019 (the “ Installments ”). Non-payment of the Installments constitutes an immediate event of default under the First Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders may accelerate the loans thereunder (and will constitute a cross-default or cross-acceleration event under certain of the Company’s other indebtedness or contractual obligations). We have been informed by certain of our lenders that they intend to instruct the Administrative Agent to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder to be immediately due and payable. Should such acceleration occur, this would also result in the occurrence of an event of default under the Second Lien Credit Agreement.

The Company also anticipates that it will not be in compliance with certain covenants set forth in the First Lien Credit Agreement as of the December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 testing dates. The December 31, 2018 non-compliance resulted from the Accounting Errors. Noncompliance with these covenants can become an additional event of default under the Credit Agreements.

It's either a complete scam being pulled off as cleanly as possible by the books, or the CEO is batshit crazy/delusional, or some other extenuating circumstance that has and will continue to prevent their business from actually being implemented.

I personally made about $5k mostly day trading YRIV until I held overnight without proper DD (yuuuge mistake) and got murdered by the 40%ish AH drop. Thankfully after I did actual DD I sold the next day when it somewhat recovered but overall I ended up losing close to $1k on this XD",2019-04-29

109,Nicky_99,em3zzes,/r/pennystocks/comments/biqs1a/interesting_article_on_yriv/em3zzes/,1,"You mention that you’re “guessing” HR made the mistake here, their guise of opinion was an overstepped boundary by making a completely false claim, stating they had 0 assets which is obviously not true. On top of this, their actual property assets doubled to about 600mil and their renovations are done by 2020, look man, maybe the original valuation was at 12$ and could’ve been wrong...do I know the answer to that; no. But it rebounded from a plummet twice, on top of this they have contracts lined up once construction is finished, I know “all gaps fill” isn’t completely true but this company is worth more than 90¢. Besides if the company was a scam why would they file a lawsuit realistically? not to sit around court for months and let money wither away I’ll tell you that much. HR has short and distorted plenty like this and aphria, with all the upside potential in trump China trade deal and building progression(which can be seen from google maps (2017-2019) this company can’t go anywhere but up.
