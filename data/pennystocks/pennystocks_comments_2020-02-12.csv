It's indicated in my birth chart that windfalls could happen and I'm still a big NOOB at stocks and something intuitively told me you need to buy INPX at .5 for all your 100K$ sim money and I did and it tanked to almost half shortly after but I knew to hold on to it and it raised dramatically on the 6th but had a reverse split on the 7th 

I didn't check it on the 6th at all which I obviously wouldn't do if it was real money and I would have effectively turned the 100K into 5.2 million... but yes I would risk a lot on penny stocks for the chance at a windfall",2020-02-12

One good way to get the true situation of a penny stock is to look them up on otcmarkets.com,  search for UNVC on there and you will see they are not even current in filing with the SEC, additionally there is actually a warning message that they might not be truthful and to invest with caution. 

You telling me a company who cant even do the proper paperwork for the sec is about to strike the deal of a lifetime with CVS!? You think CVS would do business with a company who currently has potential investors warned they could get screwed? This is how you know man. Also you‚Äôll notice they are saying they are ‚Äúsourcing‚Äù their CBD from Israel. This is another usual red flag, whenever an important aspect of the company is occurring or operating out of the country = lying because who is going to go to Israel to check.

Another red flag is constant ‚Äúany day now news will hit, don‚Äôt be on the sidelines‚Äù, after many times of it not happening = means it‚Äôs not happening. Pumpers continue to pump while they offload enormous amount of shares while trying not to be obvious and tank the price. 

Many people who own a lot of shares of something will try to tell you it‚Äôs great so you will buy and buy, which drives the price up so they can sell to you, they are trying to make you a fool.
