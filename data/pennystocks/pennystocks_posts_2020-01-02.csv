3,1933 Industries Inc TGIF.CN TGIFF Short term Breakout Predictions,ej2gz6,thatguybuddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ej2gz6/1933_industries_inc_tgifcn_tgiff_short_term/,6,4," 

In the same spirit of my RYU post i thought I would share this stock and post from the TGIF Facebook group. It is a stock that has been on the decline for all of 2019. One big soar spot is the huge extraction facility that should have been done by the end of 2019 looks to be delayed until mid 2020. With out the facility they are near profitability with out it and have cut costs dramatically. They are also one of the few weedstocks with the hard cash to survive the year regardless of the market. It has had major catalysis in the last few months that do not show on the last financials and will be evident in the next financial release:

**Putting things in perspective and evaluate 1933 potential's and more specifically for the next quarter.**

The information listed below all come from the update included in the last quarter's publication, except if mentioned.

1- The next quarter will include the months of November, December and January and will be published at the beginning of April.

2- The sales resulting from the **Tony Hawk** (also and investor) deal have begun on November 4th and will be included in the next quarter's results.

3- **BLONDE** was announced on September 10th 2019 and was on the market for almost half of the last quarter and will be present for all of the next quarter, according to the release of October 22nd, this products is highly in demand.

4- The licence deal with **PLUGplay** was announced on September 19th and was certainly not representative of it's real potential in the results of last quarter that was ending October 31st. If anyone knows the sale availability date, I would like to know. I am under the impression that it will contribute much more in next quarter's results.

5- The first harvest of the 67000sqft was done mid December (approx 450lbs for 2 zones). I don't know how many pounds was produced by the old 12000sqft and if other harvests are planned before the end of the present quarter but, in the end, harvests should be done every 2 weeks. I don't know the treatment time of the harvests (drying, transformation, etc.) to compare the potential but I have no doubt that the moving must have temporarily impacted the production and the last financial results. If someone can let us know a bit more on this topic, could help us do a better DD.

6- **GreenSpectrum** as published on Instagram that they will launch their first product made in collaboration with 1933 in California in January, present quarter ending at the end of said month. Will that affect the earnings? Good question....

7- The vape scandal has negatively impacted sales, a couple studies were made and published since then, proving that the majority of problematic substances were produced and sold on the black market. Maybe we can hope for a little upward move of the sales in the next quarter without hoping for a miracle.

8- Will the second licence agreement with DNA for CBD product announced on December 12th positively impact next quarter ending in January?",2020-01-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ej2gz6/1933_industries_inc_tgifcn_tgiff_short_term/

14,ENSV,eizysc,steveissuperman,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eizysc/ensv/,1,2,"ENSV is not a sexy tech or bio small cap, but I do feel like it may have the kind of setup that most of us degenerate gamblers look for. 

The company provides production services to oil and gas drillers. Their most profitable service is frack water heating for cold weather drilling in the colder climates during winter. They often post profits in Q4-Q2 and suffer during the summer. The company bought out one of their larger competitors a year or so ago, but then trouble hit the oil markets (especially frackers) and they've struggled with bearish sentiment ever since despite posting a profit last Q1. 

Oil is back up, and the company has a positive outlook for 2020. They believe that producers will refresh their drilling and production budgets for the new year with stable prices, so they'll have plenty of work. They often provide an investor update in advance of their ERs, so we can expect one later this month. 

The share price is so low that good news could really pop it. It's a thinly traded ticker, but it does have a large institutional investor (Crossriver) that is heavily invested at a high average.

The stock is currently facing exchange compliance issues on two fronts: price and shareholder equity. I believe they will be able to get back over both of these without any trouble simply because they are entering their profitable season and are about to post good numbers that will boost the share price. That doesn't eliminate the risk that they might opt for a reverse split however.
