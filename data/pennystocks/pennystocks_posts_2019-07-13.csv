The focus will be for the long term investing (and not the trading).

1,TTCM-Told Ya !!!,cckuur,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cckuur/ttcmtold_ya/,7,5,"Good evening folks. Iâ€™m working nights so I missed all the fun today with TTCM. But I woke up to great news and about 140% increase in my TTCM holdings. 

I hate to say Told ya just yet (As other Reddit folks have been saying as well) because there is still room to triple or more your money here. 

The news today was great. Now watch for more Press releases. A share buy back..AGAIN!!!, potiential world record breaking, general public launch. Thereâ€™s no telling where itâ€™s gonna stop.

This is just my excitement Iâ€™m not trying to be some sort of pumper but when you call it and itâ€™s right it feels good.  It doesnâ€™t happen often so Iâ€™ll enjoy it while I can.

Hereâ€™s my prediction, we will see the price dip and spike in an upward trend as news releases come out. Once the world record is broken OTC land will dump most of their shares. Ainâ€™t gonna lie Iâ€™ll prolly let some go and grab some profit. Iâ€™d be stupid not to. Then the stock will slip down and find a new support line. 

After this it will be time to re enter or hold shares that werenâ€™t sold and continue to hold as the company buys back more shares, rolls out new versions, possibly is bought out or what ever. 

45% of the AS is held by insiders. They want this to succeed more than we do!!! 

So.... thankful for todayâ€™s run, looking for 3-4 more runs to get us where we need to be. Find some exit strategy for some profits. Ride the leftovers and maybe purchase more once things settle. 

Thatâ€™s as honest is a can tell you from this side of things. FYI  a pumper would never be that honest.  Iâ€™m just a regular dude hoping to share some of what Iâ€™ve seen. 

These are the kind of companies  that make penny land fun!!! 

Do your own research and consider TTCM 

Good luck to all
