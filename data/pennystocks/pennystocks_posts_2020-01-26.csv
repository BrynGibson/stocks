9,4 Biotechs Presenting Data Soon,euamis,jameson62,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/euamis/4_biotechs_presenting_data_soon/,1,14,"Keeping some of [these penny stocks](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2020/01/26/4-penny-stocks-to-watch-expecting-key-data-soon-january-27-2020/) in mind this week. Then again mid-February for some.  TROV is first up. They had a presentation on Saturday. Based on the poster info in that article, it seems like results were positive?  Either way, TROV has been a disappointment for most longs but definitely has been a fun one to flip for a lot of people in here. 

Other than that, I'm interested in what happens with KMPH. supposedly had a ""goal"" of doing some NDA by the end of January. Not sure if they'll reach that gold but....worth a spot on my watch list for now.",2020-01-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/euamis/4_biotechs_presenting_data_soon/
