9,PZRX now PZRXQ,7vfj6s,ImEasilyConfused,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7vfj6s/pzrx_now_pzrxq/,1,3,"Hey all, trading newbie here.

This morning I saw that PZRX became PZRXQ. From my understanding, the company’s been dealing with bankruptcy or something. Much of the business/financial talk feels beyond my knowledge. Long story short, I’ve just been trying to follow some more experienced traders, and their advice. That’s how I got caught up in investing in this company. Even after doing my own DD, I just don’t think I was experienced/knowledgeable enough to follow it or know the signs.

Anyways, I’m trying to use this stock as a major learning point. Anybody been following this company? It’s been plummeting lately, but not sure if there’s potential for it to bounce back at all. I bought in when it was at 0.35 and was hoping to see it eventually hit at least 0.6 again, but it seems unlikely.

I’m not sweating it too hard, and will only be losing out $50 thankfully. But I’d like to learn and grow from this investment. Thanks",2018-02-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7vfj6s/pzrx_now_pzrxq/

22,"Lets talk about $BPMX: Research, Rumors, and mores... (xpost from r/RobinHoodPennyStocks)",7vil31,zas11s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7vil31/lets_talk_about_bpmx_research_rumors_and_mores/,28,21,"So If you are new here I am sure you are wondering what is $BPMX and why there is so much discussion about the stock on this subreddit. Most of us (myself included) post memes about the stock so I felt it was about time to actually sink our teeth into a basic stock and business discussion about BioPharmX. Most of you probably already know most of this but I feel It all needed addressed in one location finally so we can discuss. Here is what I found:


**What the hell is BioPharmX($BPMX)?**


Here's a great quote directly from their website:

“BPMX is committed to providing innovative healthcare products through its unique, patented platform technologies for pharmaceutical, over-the-counter (OTC) and supplement applications.”
In plain terms they are a company trying to develop over the counter supplements primarily for acne.


**Why should I be excited about acne medicine?**


Well this is r/PennyStocks after all. Penny stocks can often be very speculative. Think high risk high reward. Great penny stocks are often companies you’ve never heard of or companies with strange products. I personally... to this very day still struggle with acne and it sucks. But let's put aside the personal interest many of us have with curing our acne. There is money in pharmaceuticals. Everyone knows the pharmaceutical business is here to stay and believe it or not one of the “safer” bets in my personal opinion. 


**But why is everyone here so hype?**


Well most of us on this sub got in on the stock when it was just $.12 or $.13. So to see it climb past $.20 makes everyone significantly happy. The best part is, it is only the beginning.


**Why hold?**


There is a lot to be excited about. So here's the latest news and what we can look forward to:


-Wall street analyst rated $BPMX a strong buy
-Stock officially NOT reverse splitting.
-(Rumor) Possible Vivo Partnership?


1.) Annual ROTH Conference Date: March 11st  2018 

The ROTH Conference is basically a dick showing contest. 550 companies come from around the world and showcase their company and products. This should be great exposure for BPMX and if I am a betting man after the conference we will see higher volume and maybe a price jump.


2.) BPMX announces their earnings and possible FDA approval Date: March 22nd 2018
This could be huge either way. Hopefully we hear good news.


3.) Completion of BPX-01 and BPX-04, clinical trials  Date: June 2018

FULL DISCLOSURE: I know nothing about clinical trials 

So far all my “novice” research shows the trials are going great. BPX-01 has completed phase 2b studies and BPX-04 has begun phase 2 studies. Whatever that means lol. One can speculate though once they are completed and approved we should see a massive price jump.


**So in conclusion,**

$BPMX is a solid bet and their future looks very promising. Most of you probably already knew most of this but I feel It all needed addressed in one location for new users sake.

**What do you guys think?**

First here is what it is:

Drone Guarder, Inc. operates as a search technology software and online platform. It collects, merges, and validates business information from the internet. The company offers search engine advertising which tracks customer interests and delivers phone calls and emails. Vopia was founded on May 14, 2012 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

Now why is it looking good.  

+23% over a 5 day period.
+122% in one year. 

They just launched their app on the 25th.  

Volume is running.  Checkout the price to volume comparison below. Trading volume in itself doesn't affect stock price directly, but it does have a huge impact on the way that shares move.   Theres a lot of confidence in this one.
