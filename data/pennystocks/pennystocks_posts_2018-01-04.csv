Ever since December of 2017 TEUM has been making big moves. They have cleared their debt that wasn't due until late 2018 and have signed multiple big contracts throughout December. They are a very active company, one of the only legit blockchain related stocks that I have seen. It may have minor red days sometime this week and next week but that is a good sign that shows that this isn't some pump and dump. It is setting up beautifully,  and I can see it surpassing $5/share sometime this week or next week. Expect some more PR(Press Releases) soon and hopefully you guys do well with it. I must disclose, to be completely transparent, that I am in a position averaged at $1.23/share. Take my post as a suggestion, not advice in what to invest in. Always do your own DD(Due Diligence)! I wish you guys luck in this new year with all trading and hope you have had a wonderful holiday season, now let's get this money!",2018-01-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7nziui/teum/

January 3
th, 2017, Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. (OTC PK: BLDV) Denver, Colorado / Toronto
Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. (BLDV) acquired ZENO Controls and Verve Living Systems in September 2016 with
the goal of repurposing the ZENO Controls IoT Platform developed for Hospitality to the Cannabis Industry.
Dubbed the first “Guest Experience Interface” the ZENO Platform provided information to Hotel Operators,
that was previously restricted to engineers and maintenance.
Now Clean 1st, parent company of Cannabis Clean, and wholly owned subsidiary of BLDV, will allow the
data that is already being collected by Seed-to-Sale programs, to be combined with ZENO &amp; VERVE IoT
Sensor Data, to contribute to compliance by leveraging Smart Contracts in a Blockchain Application.
“The focus of this pilot” said Josh Alper CEO of BLDV, “is to test the system’s ability to track thousands of
tiny events that all contribute to producing safe cannabis products and a healthy workplace, the Pilot will
be built in Ethereum and have an ERC20 Compliant Token, we will test the use of Tokens as a method of
incentivizing employees to use data collectors and enter data blockchain systems. The idea of Smart Contracts
between employees and the operational process will investigated by the team.”
“This is not an ICO” continued Alper, “it is a collaboration between Equipment Manufacturers,
Cultivation Partners, Internet of Things developers and Supply Chain Partners to improve
communications between stakeholders, if we are successful we will have an application that can be used
in multiple vertical markets to enable Sanitation and Safety Compliance, then we talk about an ICO”
The pilot deployment will in Canada in the 2nd Quarter of 2018, an animated game version of the
program (think Sim City) will be released as a marketing tool within 2018, full deployment in 2019.

How can I do better?",7o2zxp,midgetgrimm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7o2zxp/new_to_pennystocks_how_am_i_doing_so_far_how_can/,5,7,"So I am very new to Pennystocks, but have been following the area of trade for a while. Finally pulled the trigger last month with a $100 deposit to TDA and picked up MJNA and SANP. I recently deposited another $100 and picked up BUDZ and HEMP, hoping for another big jump in BUDZ and HEMP has some good news recently and I think will be a good long term hope.

My goals are to do semi long term investing and also try to make some money on the side. 

Really looking for more info to find out about stocks, and to learn trends and how to read them. I use sites like this one, crunchbase, marketwatch etc. Just wasn't sure if there were definitive guides or resources one must read.

Thanks, happy trading.",2018-01-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7o2zxp/new_to_pennystocks_how_am_i_doing_so_far_how_can/

$BSTN Averaging 2 Voyages a month. Just finished the first of 2018! On average 1 million per trip. Should make between 18-24 million in 2018 (made 4.8 million in 2017 and 21.1 million in 2016)! That is if they do not buy another boat (which is planned!) On top of that they have had MANY insider buys with recent a 1.6 million share buy yesterday! People are loading up! Baltic dry index continues to steam roll upward! This is the most under valued stock in the shipping industry and maybe all of OTC. This low floater will move soon get in before you miss the boat!
