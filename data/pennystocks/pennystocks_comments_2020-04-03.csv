I've learned this week that there's like two weights that can tie you down when a play doesn't pan out...The first is mental, which sticks, but can be converted to exp. once the person comes to terms with the 'win some/lose some' mentality...  


The second is the physical, which purely involves just constantly being visually reminded of this clusterfucc decision in your portfolio...It's draining. When i finally sold my .32 ship and waited until (what I thought) was a good entry point back into TOPS, I noticed that I just mentally felt better bc I've moved on, but also, I was excited to track my portfolio again bc I knew that loss wasn't there anymore(It's there, but I've already absolved it).   


I know I still lost money on it (that's the mental) but refreshing my portfolio is something I'm back to being excited about, instead of avoiding it bc of the possibility of SHIP's going down further on top of the already gargantuan loss...There has to be optimism in trading or there simply is none; and when that occurs...sell it baby!",2020-04-03
