I sold for a profit, but decided to let half sit in there and just not even look at it. I can't recall exactly how much, but I want to say I had maybe 1-2k shares. Then they reverse split a bunch of times. 

I recently checked up on it for the first time in months and saw the stock was up over $3 (when I had bought in at .06) and I got super excited and went to check out my Fidelity account just to see I no longer have any shares of DCTH. In fact it showed I have -10 shares and there was info in there they did yet another RS on 5/2.

What does this mean if by some miracle DCTH ends up bouncing back and becoming a thriving business? Are my stocks literally just gone forever, or would I get them back if DCTH becomes huge? Not that I have any hopes for the stock itself, nor am I asking for thoughts on the stock, but I'm just curious what would  happen in this situation.",2018-05-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8igae8/question_on_a_stock_disappearing_due_to_rs/

11,Overnight plays for 5/10: BIEL UHLN,8igytw,dirtywiggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8igytw/overnight_plays_for_510_biel_uhln/,3,1,"Everything sucks. We have seen the death of giants like AXXA, CELZ, and ANDI this week and recently. Am looking for new plays and the only tolerable plays left are UOIP after morning panics and UHLN. AXXA is like juggling knives and can kill an account in a day. That said it still could recover a day this week but so risky

BIEL is subject to people waiting for FDA news. When the news on the meeting did not come out, it looked like ANDI when people expected more. I expect a recovery like last time and am not nervous to hold for a day. You have to watch the morning and see if the news comes out. If not people sell and do not want in after 9:31 pretty much and we saw that today. Luckily it never dips late day. 

UHLN is another that is a good play only if you get a dip buy. Set your limit and stick with it. Still gives short morning spikes but be fast. It is back to pre-spike levels and tomorrow morning will be telling for it. ",2018-05-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8igytw/overnight_plays_for_510_biel_uhln/

About Echelon Corporation

“For 30 years Echelon ($ELON) has pioneered the development of open-standard networking platforms for connecting, monitoring and controlling devices in commercial and industrial applications. With more than 140 million connected devices installed worldwide, Echelon's solutions host a range of applications enabling customers to reduce energy and operational costs, improve safety and comfort, and create efficiencies through optimizing physical systems. Echelon is focusing today on two IoT (Internet of Things) market areas: creating smart cities and smart campuses through connected outdoor lighting systems, and enabling device makers to bring connected products to market faster via a range of IoT-optimized embedded systems”


So they have all these fancy smart systems that win awards and shit. Really cool stuff. 

Now is 4Q they made some nice moves, 

 — A major city in New England selected Echelon's IoT-enabled, connected streetlight system to intelligently control 5,150 LED streetlights in the downtown district. Together with the potential for sizable energy and maintenance savings, Echelon was chosen for its proven ability to control and manage the city's lighting infrastructure through a combination of wireless connections for conventional light fixtures, and power line communication for decorative lighting fixtures. This system is currently being installed.

   -- The City of Rancho Cucamonga in southern California selected Echelon as part of their LED streetlight retrofit project. Not only will the city have fine-grained control over its streetlights and automated monitoring and reporting for the first time, they also estimate that the retrofit will save over $1.0 million a year from lower energy use as well as maintenance savings. This project is also currently being installed.

   -- A major city in Silicon Valley selected Echelon's lighting controls for 5,749 LED street lights. Echelon was chosen for its ability to control and manage the city's lighting infrastructure and being ""Smart City"" enabled to support future IoT applications. This project is currently being installed. 

They are growing rapidly in an emerging space, now you must trust in $ELON because as a member you should have at least 1 $ELON in your back pocket. 
 
Imagine going up to that pretty bitch at the bar, 

“hey you know, I work close with $Elon” “Really!? Omg how cool” 
“Yeah I provide him advice on how to run the company”
 “wow so you’re like smart and have money”
“Yup, now lets hop in my 98  Nissan Altima”
“why do you drive that?”
“Because I’m smart, I bought a reliable car and Put my money to work since I don’t have a car payment.”
“Take me now you genius !”


Like that’s the power that comes with owning $ELON now the average volume for this coming is 16k .. I’ll let that sink in.. yesterday was under 3k.. so we might create a demand for the stock, buy low sell high right?

19,I have been keeping my eye on JET and...,8iirm0,karben14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8iirm0/i_have_been_keeping_my_eye_on_jet_and/,26,17,"...this is what I see. Looking at the chart for early 2017, JET \(Canada Jetlines\), is at about 20 cents, not much happening except the usual hype for startup companies like JET. The price climbs up and up in anticipation of a June 2018 startup date for flights, reaching $1.42 by March 13, even though the most important ingredient was missing, there were no planes because, 

*""  With respect to aircraft acquisition, the  current market for leased aircraft has tightened considerably during  2017 and early 2018. The principal reasons are the well documented  engine manufacturing issues for the Airbus neo\-powered aircraft, the  increased demand for the Boeing freighter conversion program for Boeing  737\-800s and world\-wide traffic demand exceeding projections. All of  these factors have led to increased demand and decreased supply of used  aircraft available for lease. ""* 

This is from the March 13, 2018  GLOBE NEWSWIRE corporate update from JET. This corporate update also said this,

*""At this stage Jetlines is in advanced  negotiations with several major aircraft lessors to secure the aircraft  required to support both its start\-up and growth plans. However, it will  not attain a June 2018 start\-up date as previously projected. Once  Jetlines has secured definitive aircraft delivery dates, it will provide  new guidance to the market on its projected start\-up date. It expects  to provide an update announcement in the second quarter of 2018.  In the  interim Jetlines continues to advance its efforts with personnel  recruitment, airport agreements, the licensing process and the financing  plan. ""*

When JET announced this on March 13, the price dropped overnight to 72 cents and eventually bounced back to the 80 cent range.

So this is where I get interested in this story, if you do DD you would see that JET is a legitimate group of people genuinely trying to startup a low cost air carrier in Canada based on success with this model in other countries. In the May 8 corporate update we read this,

*"" VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May  08, 2018  \(GLOBE NEWSWIRE\) \-\-* ***Canada Jetlines Ltd.*** *\(TSX\-V:*[*JET*](http://globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=JET&amp;exchange=15)*\) \(OTCQB:JETMF\) \(the “****Company****” or “****Jetlines****”\)  provides an update on recent corporate developments related to aircraft  acquisition. Jetlines concluded a term sheet on April 23, 2018 to lease  two Airbus A320 aircraft and made a deposit payment of US$876,000. The  term sheet is subject to executing a definitive lease agreement and  other conditions customary to a transaction of this nature. ""* 

Then I Googled ""term sheet"" and found out what it was and how it is one of the steps before signing a lease. They put $876,000 deposit and are now in term sheet negotiations which means that the next corporate update will announce a lease agreement being signed. At 81 cents a share I think I will buy a couple thousand shares of this.",2018-05-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8iirm0/i_have_been_keeping_my_eye_on_jet_and/
