""The  Company  records  an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  related  to  trade  and 
other receivables that are considered to be uncollectable. The allowance is based 
on the Company’s 
knowledge of the financial condition of its customers, the aging 
of the receivables, the current business environment and historical experience. A 
change to those factors could impact the estimated allowance and the provision 
for bad debts""

""Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for 
the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. Cash is placed with a major Canadian 
financial institution and the Company’s 
concentration of credit risk for cash and maximum 
exposure thereto is $
15,468
(2016
-
$46,917
).
With  respect 
to  its  accounts  receivable,  the  Company  assesses  the  credit  rating  of  all 
customers and maintains provisions for potential credit losses, and any 
such losses to date 
have been within management’s expectations. The Company’s credit risk with respect to 
accounts  receivable  and  maximum  exposure  thereto  is  $
9,
652,926
(201

$
925,334
). 
Accounts receivable are shown net of provision of credit losses of $
n

(201

$
22,022
).

So basically, no cash has changed hands, no idea who the clients are, no idea where they are advertising, no idea of their technology, no way to sign up for ads on their website.

Anyway, how can you have earnings if you haven't collected yet??? All those companies file chapter 13 and you're fucked.

CNCT is also extremely unstable.

So is BMXC.

UHLN is severely overbought, which means any poor dumb ass who bought it Friday, or moves to buy it Monday will take a massive hit.

ANDI looks depressed. Theyre doing terrible. Those charts are seas of red. 

Something all of your chosen stocks have in common is that they gave zero indicator of popping off, and have no reason for doing so either. Add that to serious instability, and what you have is a set of stocks I highly suggest you stay away from. I cannot stress this enough. Learn to read charts properly. ",2018-04-29

Made a 10% from one dip buy even though there ended up being 2 available. ANDI was another that ran a little mid day. Yes down now. Correct.
