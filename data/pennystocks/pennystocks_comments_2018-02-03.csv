Essentially, the full story is needed if not the article would appear misleading.

15,DudelyMore,dtoiw6q,/r/pennystocks/comments/7uwcqi/you_know_something_is_wrong_when_spcl_and_jbzy/dtoiw6q/,1,"All that was in there. It would be up to the reader to come to any conclusions. DOLV was one of many tickers that ultimately proved to be either shell companied or just easily manipulated micro caps that a group of ""investors"" used in a broad pump and dump scheme. The article never even mentioned JBZY. Best case, JBZY used DOLV because it was a shell company and therefore an easier reverse-merger. However, implementing reverse-merging to change the tickers, company names, and companies' info was one of the strategies this group used to hide the companies' histories and cover their tracks. 

SO, it COULD be inferred that this is exactly what happened with JBZY, as it is exactly what these guys did before and this stuff CAN happen on OTC markets. I never said that I thought this was the case, I only posted the article for penny stock traders so they could make sure they didn't get sucked into any on the list. This was right around the time DOLV became JBZY. So a bunch of people got butt hurt that I posted true information that they SHOULD that maybe created doubt about their magic ticker. 

The guys in that scheme were prosecuted, but they thought they only got ""middle management"". So the big players are probably still out there, and I have seen this type of thing come out of China several times in the early 2000s. So just be careful. ",2018-02-03

And you could forgive me for not taking at face value that the new benevolent leaders piggybacking on a tainted ticker must be above board. I don't actually think it is a scam ticker. I think they wanted to get some capital from sale of stock because their revenue is low and it is hard to vet cash on hand for a foreign OTC. And I'm sorry, but their demo video a few months back did not encourage me to invest. Good luck, but I think you should be swing trading if anything right now, not going long.
