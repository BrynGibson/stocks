This most recent dip is quite good if you’re looking for a stock to hold for a while. It’s easily 6-7$  within a half year or so. Also, let me know if you want to hear all my research. In addition not a bad swing trade for the next few weeks when this bottoms out around 2.5-3.0",2018-05-31

When you sell a loss, they look 30 days in the past, and 30 days in the future of the trade date. So it has a 61 day window.  Since you made another purchase two weeks ago, that falls in that window. So the loss on the sale is“disallowed,” or  postponed and added to the cost basis of the shares you still have. ",2018-05-31

The niche is basically selling expensive brands for cheap buying other stores overstock and such. These expensive brands you can get for basically 20% off normal price. Q4 conference call new president said they would cut corporate staff, fix their website(pretty good website) with now ecommerce delivery to stores. As well as cut down on bad inventory I believe by 15%.  This was significant. I work retail. Cutting bad inventory is no joke it can flip a store’s sales.  SMRT recently reported 16 cents eps and has sense rebounded from their recent lows.  In addition to this if you are long.
