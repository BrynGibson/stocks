Rarely do you find a comparable between companies because they are so unique in what patents they hold and what place they have in the consumers mind. Their R&amp;D spending is a huge percentage of their net income and for 99% of the small companies you look at they fail. Honestly it is a shot in the dark because everything is being tested by the FDA. Without the medical knowledge (even with the medical knowledge) it is extremely hard to guess, but the rule of thumb is the further down a drug is (phase 3 or phase 4) that is when hype starts to build up and people start taking the drug seriously. Even then its a shot in the dark because in many cases they fail the approval at the end. I generally don't recommend going into healthcare plays because it really is difficult to gauge if it is ""safe"" without years of experience. Unless you are looking at China.

I'm longer than most on this board looking at at least one month per company. Occasionally I'll do the quick 5 day swings like others.

I have multiple torpedos in the water at a time, usually 100 shares of each company regardless of price. I may adjust up or down based on price or prospect.

First I look at the Yahoo Finance profile to see what the company does and what its therapeutic intent is. If it makes sense, I check the company website to see the therapeutic/disease. If the prospect doesn't interest me and flicks my ""this doesn't sound like it's going to work"" sense, I close the tab.

If I understand what they're doing, then I look at the company's historic chart, last few financials to see cash reserves vs burn, and read 1-6 months of news. If no red flags and I consider going in.

Examples:
$BIVI is my long play. They're investigating FDA approval for a drug already approved in EU. They're looking to get it approved for ascites/cirrhosis. So it's a modest disease population that doesn't have a lot of pharmacologic options (rifiximin, erythromycin). They aren't very far along, but it's a proven drug in the world already so I'm in it for the long haul. If they get FDA approval, I could see a big company going to buy them because terlipressin can be used in septic shock, which is, like, the most common condition found in ICU's in the country. To get approval for that would be YEARS after its original FDA approval, and I don't know if I'd want to be in it for that long haul.

$NBRV is a little further along, and they're developing new antibiotics for UTI (and a few other things). Although they could fail, their treatment population is significant enough for me to play the risk.

One stock that goes against my opinion of ""refractory"" diseases is $ATNM. They're working on new diagnosis AML, but also refractory cancers also. Because they're not betting one compound on one disease, it's $0.5 a share, $100 is worth a risk.

I don't have any ticker symbols for companies I don't ""believe in,"" but I remember someone here pumping up a company that is looking to treat some complication of Huntington's disease. Another company was looking to work on Prader-Willi. Both are genetic/metabolic disorders that aren't common, and I didn't think the treatment population was going to be big enough to have upside reward vs long term risk. Other",2019-04-07

I would say given the buy wall on the level 2 that the general expectation is an eventual climb. it already brushed 0.01 once, just on the news it was working to go current. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the fact that the new owner has played things pretty close to the vest and let the price stabilize is also probably a good sign. a pump would just be pushing news to get the shares up and short it back down. i take the silence as a pretty good sign. it also helps to remember that OTC tends to move slowly during a process like this, and patience is key.
