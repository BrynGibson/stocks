But my reasonings have to do with their last 12 filings, your points are really legitimate for past events, but a company wouldnt push this hard to stay on nsye,  and wouldve quit 2 r/s ago to open their patent to the public, theyve been expanding drastically and this is a longterm stock if you hadnt checked their 5 and 10 year plan pre MNGA into TRNX, get now if you want your money back.

They have until 8/21 to reach the beginning of the consecutive 20 trading day target for over $1 by 9/19 and people will keep the price up wanting a free piece of otc Taronis fuels to be made gor those on record by 8/15. They wouldnt announce ""hey we have 5m dollars free cash saved"" for no reason. Theyre giving opportunity for those that have lost money, no r/s is likely in this kind of situation, i think they'll reach $1by then.

Mainly because of this: 

-their fuel demand has increased drastically since last year, and then this year they are using 3x the amount of magnegas used last quarter, and it is supposidly faster, more efficient than acetylene and propane, and also 20% cheaper. 

-contract deals with the army are likely, as there was a meeting in ohio to last august.

-they were featured on gasworld mag and theyve been reporting how much theyre making monthly which is approximately 300% more.

-22 locations and growing
