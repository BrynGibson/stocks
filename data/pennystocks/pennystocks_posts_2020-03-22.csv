5,"$TOMDF new entry into testing kit scene, look out $AYTU",fmsvg4,oi45tj2mo45,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fmsvg4/tomdf_new_entry_into_testing_kit_scene_look_out/,1,6,"AYTU vs TOMDF, seems interesting, some thoughts:

Being in the testing business they know the process better.

It needs to be **validated** in testing labs locally before FDA approval, already underway as they have the lab and the know-how, same for any other company wanting to sell their kits overseas. If the test kits are not validated it's the same as you went and shipped it over yourself from Alibaba, but, would you use it? Would the government risk another headline of 'faulty kits from CDC'? 

Also look at that volume: 500k shipment on validation, 300k daily production capacity. At least there will be enough for everyone.

12,thoughts on OPK/ALT,fn19vu,rockandahardplace08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fn19vu/thoughts_on_opkalt/,1,7,"Im still holding out on a couple thousand shares of each, I was wondering about your guys thoughts with each.  

Ill start with ALT: So I heard about a 60 minutes segment that was airing tomorrow and featuring MNRA/INO, that I guess was my first question, do you think that show is going to have a negative or positive effect on ALT? I didn't see anywhere that ALT would be in it at all but the whole thing is talking about finding a vaccine and I have always liked the whole plan they have with the NasoVax vaccine they are going for. I also keep hearing that they have been looking for a partner, im going to copy/paste a post I keep seeing on yahoo finance/stocktwits.

$ALT There are 4 facts that need to be put together in order to come up with a prediction for us longs:   
1.  On Wednesday, GARG in an interviewed said that ALT's development is a contribution to public health, and that it would be a collaboration with government agencies and other stakeholders.  He was encouraged by $8.3B in fighting coronavirus.   
2. On Friday after the market closed, we learned that GARG had hired a Washington law firm to represent its interest in issues related to pandemic.   
3. In a PR late last month, Garg said he was actively engaged in discussion with a number of potential partners.   
4. Garg has met with Roth Capital multiple times (virtual meetings)   
   
Give those for facts, I think two scenarios may happen:   
   
1.  ALT would enter a contract with BARDA to produce coronavirus vaccine for the US government, similar to its current contract to produce anthrax vaccine (with contract value up to $133.7B).   
2. A buyout is in the work.   
 

I really like how ALT has been able to hold steady at 3 $ throughout all this crashing and really unpredictable markets for the last little while, it gives me hope that on any decent news we could see a good jump. what's your guys thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now OPK, so these guys have been mentioned in the latest white house briefing that was mentioned in another post and they have gotten a bunch of decent news throughout the last little while but any good news seems to make the PPS go down? its weird to me, even after the contract with the state of New York, that didn't seem to have a effect at all, now they are opening another drive through in New Jersey and still no effect, I was hoping yesterday the CV taskforce would of said something about the appeal for funds that the American Clinical Laboratory Association submitted for 5 billion, Bio reference was one of the labs listed.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/labs-testing-covid-19-seek-5-billion-in-u-s-emergency-funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/labs-testing-covid-19-seek-5-billion-in-u-s-emergency-funding) 

But heres another post from someone on yahoo finance highlighting some of the other things going for opk

 Dr. Cohen on Morning Joe. Highlights:  


1. BRL seeing 3 groups, hospitals, doctors offices and drive thrus.  
2. Many states calling BRL for help setting up drive throughs.  
3. Original test from CD very slow. BRL bought in 4 different platforms IN ADDITION to CDC test (this is how they manage to do so many).  
4. Can do 10,000 test a day, 15,000 within the week, and scaling up to 20,000  
5. More demand than ability to test even at 20K/day  
6. Police and Fire departments calling about weekly proactive tests.  
7. With additional equipment and reagents could be 100,000 a day.  
8. NY City is primary 11 Hospitals  
9. Next limiting factor is swabs and then reagents

So I guess my question is with OPK, What in the hell is it going to take to see a jump in PPS with this one? they seem to be a promising company with a lot of testing being done, I know lots of people don't seem to like this Frost character, do you guys see this one getting a good jump soon?

13,Why I’m in with $AYTU,fn0ouk,dp79,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fn0ouk/why_im_in_with_aytu/,1,42,"You guys might have seen my previous posts last week regarding my analysis on Sabby’s holdings. If not, here you go:

Sabby’s investment in CODX and AYTU:

Basic analysis of Sabby’s NEW holdings and their performance:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fhrc08/aytu_simple_analysis_of_sabby_new_holdings/

I know Sabby has a reputation. But when they take a long position, the stock generally does really well. From what I’ve heard, Sabby is long on Aytu (for now). 

———

Quick background of Aytu’s covid-19 test:

First, if you don’t know, Aytu’s tests are point of care, serological tests that provide results in less than 10 minutes. The CE-marked tests just require a drop of blood from a finger prick and the results are known on the spot (i.e. doctors office, nursing home, drive ups). They don’t require complex machines or require any special lab materials, especially those very difficult to find specialty swabs. 

New analysis-
In recent days, head scientists have been calling for point of care, serological tests. Most notably, Scott Gottlieb (former head of the FDA who stepped down months ago). Here’s a few of his tweets:

https://twitter.com/scottgottliebmd/status/1241419593014484993?s=21

https://twitter.com/scottgottliebmd/status/1241394220633600000?s=21

https://twitter.com/scottgottliebmd/status/1241423420711219200?s=21

Serological tests today can act as the first line of defense... initial screenings. They’re inexpensive, portable (no refrigeration requires), can be manufactured at enormous scale. require no lab materials, and give results in minutes. 

But as Scott Gottlieb noted above, they are absolutely critical ongoing to determine immunity and the presence of antibodies. I could give a deeper analysis on why that’s important, but all of the info is found in the last tweet posted above by Dr. Christakis. 

Lab swab tests from Cepheid, Thermo Fisher, Quest, LabCorp, etc. cannot detect these antibodies and gauge immunity. You just cannot do this with swabs and only blood tests can do so. 

Lab tests will have their place in confirming covid-19 cases but serological tests will very soon be found everywhere. 

Now, why Aytu over the others? 

First: it’s CE-marked. Not all the others have this important European approval. 

Second: the test kits were developed in China. They had the head start in identifying antibodies and these tests have been used widely there already. The manufacturer is a company that has previously been funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation:
https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2018/11/OPP1197153

Third: they have institutional backing. Yes, I know this is a sore point for investors due to their offerings. But just remember that these were direct offerings to institutions and not public offerings. The CEO has gone on record to say that they received enormous number of requests, and I believe they needed the cash to secure advanced orders in larger quantities. 

Fourth: they have a huge head start in the United States. Colorado will be deploying these next week. 
https://www.denverpost.com/2020/03/20/coronavirus-tests-colorado-aytu-cory-gardner/‬

Fifth and finally: they have the backing of a Democratic Governor and a Republican Senator (both from Colorado). This is bi-partisan support and no other serological test has received this type of backing. In fact, the Senator stated himself that he will be pushing for this nationwide 
https://twitter.com/roblowtv/status/1241091908673437696?s=21

Again, just explaining why I’m in and holding. I personally believe the upcoming week will be a good one for Aytu. The big news of Colorado jumping on board was announced very late on Friday, which is why you see the late action on the stock price. 

Make sure you do your own research and due diligence. Make your own decisions and verify sources. Don’t make a decision based on what I said.. I am after all a Reddit stranger.",2020-03-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fn0ouk/why_im_in_with_aytu/

Surgical equipment not basic supplies that hospitals will need in excess. So not going to go up because of that

Large volume increase recently though. 

Looks like the price is being manipulated to go down, and it was only going up before the crash. Bid is currently 2$ below last price and ask price is 20¢ below last price.

Earnings are kinda meh they had a good q1-2020 but then q2-2020 was worse than any other earnings.

Not worth buying right now usually pumpers like a few days of leveling out and it’s been going down for the past bit.

But the thing is insiders have bought 20k shares recently so that may indicate good news in the future. Which is exactly what pump and dumpers are looking for.

My guess is pumpers are getting it to go down now and hoping it’s a good stock for news because it’s healthcare equipment, and there’s a good chance of news in the future. What do y’all think?
