Increased legalization over the past five years has precipitated a new perception of cannabis nationwide. Yet, firing up a joint or bowl in public remains likely to raise eyebrows. By contrast, imbibing alcoholic beverages is common practice in social settings. Kalvara (Kalvara.com), a new beverage infusion system, was designed to appeal to consumers who want a THC buzz without drawing attention to their cannabis consumption.

Using a patented technology called Vessl, Kalvara is packaged in small, nitrogen-pressurized ‚Äúcaps‚Äù that, with a simple twist, release a THC nanoemulsion into a proprietary bottle filled with two ounces of liquid. Once a cap‚Äôs contents are dispensed, the bottle contains a 10mg serving of a neutral-tasting THC beverage that can be mixed with whatever the user wants to drink. Each Kalvara package contains four caps, and the bottle is reusable. Simply refill the container with water, attach a new cap, and it‚Äôs ready to go again.

‚ÄúThis has one flavor, one function, and one dose,‚Äù said Walter Apodaca, a twenty-five-year veteran of the beverage industry who now serves as chief executive officer for Vessl (VesslInc.com) and Gizmo Beverages in Tempe, Arizona. ‚ÄúKalvara can be a replacement for alcohol in social settings, but without the stigma of smoking or vaping.‚Äù

One of the benefits of the Vessl technology is each dose in the caps is precisely measured, so the consumer can expect the same experience every time. The buzz sets in within ten to fifteen minutes, Apodaca said, so gratification is relatively quick compared to edibles.

The Vessl technology was developed by Scottish inventor Bernard Frutin, who created a pressurized delivery module that automatically expels its contents into a container of liquid when the user opens the container. Apodaca agreed to commercialize Vessl, and now he licenses the technology to partners in the U.S. and internationally.

Manufacturers of cannabis products face numerous logistical challenges getting their products to market, not the least of which is preserving freshness and potency as they make their way to retail shelves. The Vessl‚Äôs oxygen-depleted, nitrogen-pressurized environment keeps active ingredients fresh without preservatives and prevents oxidation caused by ultraviolet light. It‚Äôs designed to optimize the freshness and potency of ingredients until the moment a consumer wants to partake.

Apodaca sees Vessl as a game-changer because it has the potential to reduce, dramatically, the amount of packaging material typically required for beverages and doesn‚Äôt require refrigeration to keep the product fresh. He estimates about 700,000 Vessl units can be shipped per truckload, whereas only about 50,000 half-liter bottles‚Äîa more traditional size for beverages‚Äîwould fit in the same space.

For the rollout, Apodaca said the company will stick to one flavor, but plans already are in the works to expand the product range.

‚ÄúI see personalization, customization, and portability being really important, so people [will be able to] choose specific strains and their desired effects,‚Äù said Apodaca. ‚ÄúTechnology is the best way to deal with that, and so we expect to have five to ten different flavors and functions to help people relax, energize, and enhance libido or creativity.‚Äù

In June, Apodaca and his Vessl technology won the Food and Beverage Innovation Forum‚Äôs Marketing Award for the packaging product that disrupts the market via groundbreaking new technology.

Between that and watching his free regular trade recaps on youtube, I learned enough to be dangerous to myself. Tim teaches a very basic, very conservative day trading style (short biased when appropriate) and is profitable, although he caveats these days that he actually makes more money from his Pennystocking Silver subscribers, etc. So he can sit back and just take the best moves, but even still, I like the fact that he keeps meticulous records about his trades, in semi-near realtime and shows that even being a conservative trader can still make a hundred grand or two a year, starting from about $12k (He's been starting new years with fresh accounts to show/prove how to build them).

Having said that, I refuse to give him another dime of my money for various reasons that are not germane to his trading education, and just about anything you'd want to know is up on youtube or via google for free. The problem is knowing what it is you're looking for.
