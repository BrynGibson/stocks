&gt;Bio stocks are typically safer in outbreaks like this.

Many bio tech companies use outbreaks to push PR headlines to bait in traders. This is done to sell off shares. You can find evidence of this inside their filings. Safer is relative, so perhaps playing stock trading roulette is safe to some people.

&gt;I almost sold half today knowing we were facing a massive drop with the futures market tanking, but I talked it over with my group, we reviewed our reasoning, and I held. I'm glad I did both. The position is solid, IMHO, and when I reviewed everything again, I couldn't find the flaw in the risk/reward of the position.

His team of experts never found a flaw of OGEN once being valued at over $100, had a 10-1 reverse split, and [a recent at-the-market offering that indicates they can sell shares at any point](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312519082478?cik=1174940). Perhaps explains why their last few spikes didn't last long.

&gt;However, considering the market, I am lowering my expectations. IF this runs into results or with results, I may exit at $2+.

Current value: $0.54, or a 300% increase according to op.

&gt;If you're beaten down, look over my linked posts and also whatever sources you have. I think we're right on this. The price is still very good. It's still up to 3 weeks out, so consider that.

I agree. I have warned against these plays and have been downvoted into oblivion. Look at my IBIO posts that were downvoted.

Thank you for pointing this out.

I will have you note, OGEN is not one of those companies, they have nothing to do with CV, nor have they tried to be.

I don't have a team. I have friends who all chose this stock and are all very worried about this timing. We used a whole lot of underlying facts. If you want to address any of them, please do!

Use facts. Use logic. Use historical references. SHARE!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Current value: $0.54, or a 300% increase according to op.

I have no idea what you're saying. It's at .53. I'm claiming that, with positive P2 results, for a drug with no competition and a serious need, it could, in fact, go 300% more up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I guess ""we"" are the voices in his head convincing himself that his investment is totally flawless. Let's see how this one works out long term. 

""We"" are the people who have invested and swung this stock for over a year and a half. ""We"" are many of the people on here that have posted about it. ""We"" have absolutely ZERO interest if you invest or not because it would make no difference.

If I were you, I WOULD NOT INVEST! DO NOT BUY THIS! You obviously have your doubts and you should trust those doubts.

However, you didn't address a single claim. You didn't add to the discussion at all.

&gt;If I were you, I WOULD NOT INVEST! DO NOT BUY THIS! You obviously have your doubts and you should trust those doubts.

Thank you, I had no intention.

&gt;TELL US WHERE WE ARE WRONG!

It's more of a faulty line in reasoning. Making assumptions, and presuming data based on incomplete information. Over the long term, especially on these micro-cap companies, you will not profit. The assumptions (guesses) are coin flipping. All these fundamentals and other various pieces of ""objective"" information will result in a slow bleed overtime. 

I'm not going to relish in the idea of this failing, although long-term after enough stock picks with the same line of reasoning, you'll lose it all. 

&gt;What is the risk?

A slow bleed overtime as the company continues to sell their shares. [Warrants](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/149315219017458?cik=1174940) and evidence of poor cash flow. The ATM and warrants have been issued within a year. Both of which give permission to dilute millions into their price. 

[OGEN has failed most of the time it's tried to jump in price within the last 5 years.](https://i.imgur.com/pbfb7d4.png)

&gt;Are they at risk of a reverse split?

Potentially.

&gt;Are they at risk of dilution?

You're at risk of getting your entry dumped on.

&gt;Will they fail P2?

I have no idea. I'm not flipping a coin that I'll make 300%. Highest odds are that I lose overtime, so I know that gambling on this idea will inevitably lose over the long term given a big enough sample size.

&gt;Help us learn, share what you know, add to the discussion, or STFU with your shallow assumptions if you have nothing to add.
I challenge you. I prefer that you win the debate and I save my investment. Have at it.

The payoff being when you're growing gray hairs, and have been around for long enough, you'll know this type of trading will fail over the long term. If you wanna jerk off to the dopamine rush of making money, then have at it.

You can make money trading pennystocks. This subreddit is a cesspool of credulous morons eagerly buying hype. Learn how to trade around them. Don't follow them. 

Some win. Most lose. Given enough time, all them lose, because they don't know how to trade. You can scream at them saying their investments will fail over the long term. Maybe not the first. But the second. Third. Fourth. Etc. Eventually it will fail, and most of the profits will evaporate. Assumptions

Temporary winners aid in confirmation bias. It's sad, but most of the posters on here will be flushed out within a year. Luckily, if you're smart enough, you can learn how to trade around with these weaker traders, and turn it into an advantage.

It's not a matter of what I want to be true, it's just what it is. Almost everyone on here will fail, and trades like DECN are great examples why. 

People have gone after me for years on this. How I was negative. How I was pessimistic on their investments. All them aren't on these subreddits anymore. The sign of profits flashing in front of someones face blinds them, resulting in shaky $0.02 cent investments to maximize that great feeling. Too bad it's short lived, and always fails. Many people know the BS on these subreddits.

I already told you once, you're in a subreddit for penny stocks, genius. When there's news about a penny stock, we post about it. Especially when that news it's about a stock that was at under 8 cents at market open, and announces that they project they'll be selling 525 million units of their product in 1 year. That's news in the ol' penny stock world, which is kind of what r/pennystocks is about.

I can only guess that you flipped coins on stocks in the past and lost and now assume that's the only way anyone chooses their investments.

I am fully aware I invest in a very high risk and high reward sector. I'm very clear about that. I do not downplay the risk and I do not exaggerate the probable reward. You can absolutely mitigate risk and elevate rewards by doing your homework, using good timing, and choosing wisely.

I have 25 years of investing that prove your presumed methods and assumptions wrong. I rely on a substantial amount of data, historical precedent, and experience.

I'm well aware of the warrants, their normal and reasonable purpose, that they are well within reason and historical precedent at this juncture, and the impact they will have if/when they are exercised.

I noticed you advised a trader that they are locked out of all trading for violating the Pattern Day Trading rules which is patently false.

If you don't have any actual reasons other than ""most people lose"", we really don't need to go any further. I'm not most people. I don't come on here and follow the heard or pump stocks.
