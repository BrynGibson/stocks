12,$PCTL,g5tej1,allisonthepants,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g5tej1/pctl/,1,30,"Hey guys!  Just wanted to offer up some info on this stock-- i believe there is potential here for some big gains long term!  The ceo gary grieco has been on the stock day podcast twice over the last two months.  I think the first podcast was more informative than the one yesterday, but feel free to check them both out.  I added a link for both below.  I'm on mobile so hopefully the links work.

PCTL in a nutshell makes a system called the annihilyzer, which is for disinfecting anything from hospital rooms to cafeterias.  They also make cleaning fluids and solutions.  For example, a hospital could have bleach and they might not know how old it is, how long it's been on their shelves.  Getting their fluids from PCTL allows them to track this info (there are other benefits as well).  In the first podcast gary talks about how their filtering systems can also be applied to the agriculture, oil, and cannabis industries.  All these industries need their products filtered to have various particulates/chemicals removed, and he talks some about the process involved and how they plan to enter these fields.  (Turns out the annihilyzer system is great at controlling mold on cannabis plants!)

They have just released some financials in the past few weeks and he stated they are now a profitable company, and in the latest podcast gary announced they expect to grow 30-40% month over month for the rest of the year (i hope so, we'll see).  PCTL also recently announced a contract with an NHS company that'll be putting them in over 600 UK hospitals in the foreseeable future.  In the second podcast gary also mentioned the company is expanding into two new production facilities.  They are currently only in SC which can cause logistical problems for shipping, especially fluids as it gets expensive quickly.  They are expanding into IN and OK to drastically reduce shipping costs and to have access to more markets.  Gary also stated they are in talks to move into China when the virus dies down.  Additionally he stated they are just beginning in the oil and cannabis industries.  

I got in for 2250 shares a couple months ago at .04.  With news of the expansions, I'll be looking for a small dip to add more.  I'll be holding this for a year plus, so no dump and dump here.

As always, make sure to do your own DD and good luck to all.  Feel free to add anything i may have left out.

Turns out this doesn't apply to cash accounts. Meaning those accounts where you've not applied to have a margin account to have more buying power. So newbies running those $1k accounts can get in and out like a virgin if they want. Especially now that there's no cost trades...

This is what TD Ameritrade confirmed to me. I can't promise that other brokers don't have a special overlay (add extra rules), so can't hurt to call and confirm with your broker. Best time to call btw is Saturday if they're open, no hold time...

You do not know what their revenue will look like, their product pipeline, capacity, distribution and market ability amongst many more things that are required to properly evaluate this stock. 

This stock was worth 6 cents just three weeks ago. Please think logically, do your due diligence and then buy into the stock. A lot of pumpers here that are invested into the stock will make you think that the current price of $0.24/share is extremely cheap and a great buy, however if you look at the history, this is the second highest peak of this stock so you will be buying at a pretty high price.

I realize this is probably a really dumb question, but I'm a bit confused on what's going on here. I recently opened an account with TD Ameritrade to play around with some pennystocks I'm not able to get on RH. I deposited $100, then it made me wait a week or so before I could start buying pennystocks. Now that it let me, instead of coming out of my Cash, I noticed it's showing a Margin Balance instead (which from my understanding, is more like a loan?). Is this expected? Or did I do something wrong when I purchased the pennystocks by not selecting Cash instead?

109,DECN (Exit Strategy),g65bjk,MoltenCare,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g65bjk/decn_exit_strategy/,9,59,"I would suggest, for those that can, add to your positions soon (its always good to add to winners even if it ruins your average). If this thing gaps up like I believe it will sell \~50% of your position at the open, or in pre market to realize some good profits. The let the other half of your position ride out the news. This both lets you realize profits and protects your downside incase the news is not good (fingers crossed it is and it moons).

I would also suggest putting either a stop loss or trailing stop on the remaining half of the shares that you are letting ride out the news. This will allow you to mitigate your risk and protect your profits. Happy trading and good luck tomorrow!

Disclosure: I hold a position in DECN. In no professional capacity am I qualified to give advice, this is opinion and experience based.

So, here's a quote Keith Berman, DECN CEO, from the most recent announcement:

&gt; ""Mr. Berman continued, ""Our discussion this coming Thursday will be longer than usual, and it will contain quite a bit of information, especially as we discuss the overwhelming response received from business and distributors for the purchase of the kits. We are overcome with optimism we are witnessing daily for this truly remarkable product.""

Don't let the shorters scare you. good news imminent. They want to rain on our parade just 'cus they didn't jump on the float.",2020-04-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g6b7yz/decn_tomorrow/
161,TSX:$CANN is a sleeping giant. $0.135 [long],g6b7bj,KrisMuskoka,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g6b7bj/tsxcann_is_a_sleeping_giant_0135_long/,1,7,"$CANN is a pot stock, let me get that out of the way right now if pot stocks aren't your thing. But if you're interested in a bit of inside info from someone very close to the company then read on. I hold &gt;10k shares.

So what is $CANN? They are a company called Heritage and they hold a bunch of smaller cannabis operations. This post is about their golden goose, a company called CannaCure. 

Cannacure holds a cultivation license and a processing license and is in the works of getting a sales license to sell under their own in house brand. We all know cultivating weed and expecting to turn a profit is a fools errand in this market, so the company does not focus on that, but it is very important. Instead, CannaCure is focussed on processing. They currently operates 2 large scale extraction machines, and has 4 more installed, approved for use, and awaiting manufacturer commissioning of vital components. Once operational this will give them the largest oil extraction capacity in Canada. 

Now, this is what I like the most about this company. They make money by operating. They aren't buying weed, extracting it, and flipping it for a profit. No, their model is much smarter. They will enter into a contract with another company, and that company is billed for any material used in processing, as well as a fee for each process. To my knowledge they are currently fulfilling 2 active contracts, one for edible oil, and another very, very large contract with a company called Cronos Group. This contract is for vape pens, and a considerable number of them over 2 years. Remember when I said they get paid for each process? Let me tell you, there are a lot of processes to take raw cannabis biomass and make a ready to go vaporizer tip. And the only expense incurred by the company is operating expense and expanding capacity with assets. 

I mentioned the cultivation was important. The reason for this ties in with their sales license and a bit of off the record stuff I'll try to spell out. They cultivate a small amount, and have been for a while. They also have a small group of employees who oversee product development. I am somewhat bound on what I can say about this product but, but I can tell you that it is new and innovative, and there isnt really anything comparable to it available right now. It is considered a proprietary process, and the product will be sold under the company's pending sales license. 

Now, let's talk money. The company reported a modest $4m in earnings for Q1 this year, which, if you read between the lines in their earnings report, does not include revenue from the cronos deal. This also includes the costs incurred from procuring additional extraction and refinement machinery in Q4 2019. This means that, into this year and next, the company is all but guaranteed to post rising profits (there are no sure things, of course). It is also worth noting that, to my knowledge, the company is still producing and shipping vape pens to the nationwide cannabis stores. 

Tl;dr $CANN has reached ATHs of $0.60-0.70 twice before, without reporting any profits. Now the company is operational, reporting positive revenue, and is in a 2 year production contract. They are at $0.135 right now, and I would consider any price under 0.30 to be a buy. Consider holding this stock for up to a year.
