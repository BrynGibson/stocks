So I bought a few shares and when it jumped at open I sold half of what I had for a tidy profit and then jumped back in at the dip. 
The technology they’ve just released is ground breaking as it allows them to update existing reactors to make them safer and more efficient, so it saves nuclear companies money and produces more energy which will greatly help with the energy crisis once implemented.

Disclaimers: I am not a professional trader, I do not work, nor have great knowledge, in the nuclear industry, I own shares of and am long on LTBR.

**What to learn ahead of time:**

[What is a Joint Venture (JV)?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp)

[What is a Letter of Intent?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofintent.asp)

**My take:**

1) The JV, in terms of the business itself, is massive. We are talking about a company with a market cap measured in the teens of millions of dollars before this week joining the nuclear industry, where contracts are measured by multiple millions of dollars each. The reason the JV is massive is because it signals that a major player backs the fuel (AREVA NP, now Framatome), that Framatome will supply the fuel, and that further testing and approval can now begin.

2) From the [revised presentation released today by LTBR](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-16UEEM/5843380401x0x969560/96AB52DA-CBFF-48C8-BF3A-7A82C9BB42D0/Lightbridge_Rev_16_JV.pdf), we can find more details, though they could change at any time. My understanding is that after the 50:50 split, each contract will generate something like $10 million annual revenue per plant for Lightbridge.

3) As mentioned on page 23, they have an initial target market in mind. These are the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) &gt;900 MWe in the US with &gt;20 years licensed life at 2025. The following is the list of qualifying reactors as of today. Note that some of the expiration times may change over the coming years to provide more reactors qualifying time.

[NRC](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/list-power-reactor-units.html)

[Wiki - List of nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors)



Name of Reactor | Owner/Operator | MWe Capacity | Expiration Date
---|---|----|----
Beaver Valley U2 | FirstEnergy Nuclear | 920 | 2047
Millstone U3 | Dominion | 1155 | 2045
Palo Verde U1 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2045
Palo Verde U2 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2046
Palo Verde U3 | Arizona Public Service Co. | 1447 | 2047
Shearon Harris U1 | Duke Energy | 900 | 2046
Vogtle U1 | Southern | 1215 | 2047
Vogtle U2 | Southern | 1215 | 2049
Watts Bar U2 | Tennessee Valley Authority | 1165 | 2055
Wolf Creek U1| Wolf Creek | 1250 | 2045


4) We know Lightbridge has a letter of intent signed with a major US utility. I don't think we know which one or the terms.

Ultimately, the JV is the end of the Catch-22 scenario. Lightbridge was stuck needing a supplier/manufacturer, but to get that they needed a letter of intent from a utility. To get a contract from a utility, they needed a supplier/manufacturer. The LOI was signed a while back and the JV today.

**The Math:**

""25% penetration of the existing U.S. market, excluding global market potential, could generate $150-200M per year of revenue at 90% gross margins from licensing."" [Lightbridge IR](http://ir.ltbridge.com/)

So pull out your spreadsheets and copy and paste this in and start playing with it.



Royalties:Reactor | Years | Reactors | Annual Rev| Earnings %| P/E | Market Cap | Out. Shares | Stock Price 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
$10000000 | 1 | 1 | =SUM(A2*B2*C2) | .9 | 15 | =SUM(D2*E2*F2) | 13800000 | =SUM(G2/H2)

 Play with the royalties anywhere from $6-10 million per reactor (I run $8 for a conservative number) since we don't know the final number yet. Number of reactors. P/E. You quickly get a grasp for the share price of this company. Obviously it's more complicated than this but this is a basic layout of the capabilities of the share price.

**The Future:**

The JV was a big hurdle but there is plenty of risk left. There could be another meltdown somewhere, no one could sign a contract, Framatome could go under, you dream it, it is possible. I for one am holding most of my remaining shares for 10+ years, barring any drastic changes to the outlook. The nuclear industry is a very, very costly place to be and right now it is dying for innovation in a time when we need more dependable green energy to balance the exceptional growth of Solar/Wind.",2018-01-25

So I borrowed 20$ a week ago and currently the price is 25$. 

I now owe someone their 20$ + 5$ of my own because the market price increased. 

Losses can be infinite when shorting. So unless you’re sure it’s going down don’t do it. ",2018-01-25

It completely depends on what your trading style is.  Some traders will be successful with long term investments using Robin Hood.  Others will day trade on Ustocktrade while having under 25k.  Others will use Charles Schwab to short stocks all day long, and others will have hundreds of thousands thrown around using interactive brokers.  

To answer the question of ""is it worth it"" depends entirely on what you want to do and what you think you will be most successful at.  

Benefits are OTC, short selling, day trading, easy transfers to and from saving accounts, customer service, credit lines, level 2 data, ease of use, tools like think or swim, the UI.    There are tons of factors.   

I think one thing most of us can agree on is that if you want to make a career out of trading, a real broker is necessary.  ",2018-01-25
