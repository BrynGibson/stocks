6,Beginners Luck?,am8jqs,adocdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/am8jqs/beginners_luck/,1,14,"Everything I've read on this sub, and in other places online have basically given the advice ""Don't invest in penny stocks"" (of course despite that advice people here obviously do).  

But I started back on January 22nd.  

I did my due diligence.  I researched the basics.  I researched what I was going to invest in.  

I keep up on everything on a day to day basis, although not from opening to close, I work third shift so that would be impossible.  

I feel like I've done....""ok"" at minimum?  

I don't have a very diverse portfolio.  

I put a grand of expendable money into four stocks.  I'm only down on one, and not by much.  And I'm watching closely where I go on that one.  

I mean, going over the four stocks, which I won't name right now, I'm at.  

A 35%, 38%, and 176% gain.  The loss on the fourth that is a loss is down 17%.  

I'm up about $500 in a little short of two weeks.  

That seems ok to me?  And again I understand I could lose this all tomorrow.  I get the volatility in OTC, and I'm preparing to make some moves at the start of next week in terms.  

I don't want to get over confident though.  Despite careful research, is it more than likely I just had some ""beginners luck"" here or what?

7,$SSFT – Undervalued OTCQB Tech Stock could be Poised for Significant Growth through 2019,amjbfn,MentalTadpole,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/amjbfn/ssft_undervalued_otcqb_tech_stock_could_be_poised/,1,4,"**Sonasoft** **Corp**, ticker symbol **SSFT**, is not a stock likely to have been on many investor’s radars AS OF YET. But a number of **BULLISH** investors expect that to change shortly, and in a BIG way. While the trading volumes in this name have been relatively low to date – The company has been quietly setting the stage for a potential explosion in awareness, and share price.

In the OTC Markets it can be extremely rare to see a company with true long-term growth potential. Many are un-reporting companies with little-to-no actual business operations.

In contrast, **Sonasoft Corp (SSFT)** appears to be the anomaly and part of the seemingly 1% of OTC companies with actual **LONG-TERM POTENTIAL**. Based out of San Jose California, with a recently acquired subsidiary directly in the technology epicenter of Silicon Valley, Sonasoft has been making some major moves towards becoming an absolute POWERHOUSE in the Artificial Intelligence, Legal Software (eDiscovery), and Data/Email Archiving space.

First a brief overview of the company 

· Sonasoft Corp is a publicly traded tech/software company on the OTC Markets under ticker symbol SSFT. 

· Focusing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) software, data archiving, and eDiscovery solutions

· The company was founded in 2003 and went public through an S-1 listing in 2012 (Which means a CLEAN shell without skeletons in the closet like most OTC reverse takeover deals).

· Large offering of software and services

· Large list of SMB’s which contribute recurring revenue for software and services

· NO TOXIC FINANCING 

· Large management and advisory team with decades of experience at major tech firms 

· Recently acquired revenue producing tech company (Cornerstone Technologies – estimated to do $13M in annual recurring revenues)

· Announced January 31, 2019 and LOI to acquire Hotify Inc., and AI software company

So, whilst it was a solid company, with a REAL business, over 20 employees, and established offices and clients prior to 2018… At the beginning of 2018, they announced a new “2018 Growth and Revenue Strategy” which listed a number of lofty goals, which IF achieved, would position the company for MASSIVE growth...

Let’s have a look at what they **ACTUALLY** accomplished in 2018;

· Completed 2-year audit, and uplisted to the OTCQB Venture Market from the Pink Sheets

· Completed Acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies (A Silicon Valley based tech firm that does an estimated $13M/year in revenues) – This compares to the $570K that SSFT did in 2017. This would account for an over 2300% increase year over year, JUST from that acquisition ALONE.

· Completed ‘Preferred Stock Initiative” – This action reduced the outstanding common share count by over 48%, bringing the share count down to 181M shares

· Won multiple major service contracts and partnerships with large organizations including; The San Jose Sharks, The Golden Gate Bridge, Exterro, and unnamed Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies.

· Announced primary focus change to Artificial Intelligence technology – then launched the technology and has since announced it has won a major contract to provide its AI solution to a Fortune 1000 Tech Company… Let’s discuss this further.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) market worldwide value was estimated at $7.35B annually in 2018, with growth predictions reaching $89 BILLION annually by 2025. The development of Artificial Intelligence has become an arms race with over 90% of tech companies aggressively trying to gain market share with the best product. 

&amp;#x200B;

Artificial intelligence has been one of the fastest-growing technologies in recent years. AI is associated to human intelligence with similar characteristics such as language understanding, reasoning, learning, problem solving, and others. Manufacturers in the market witness enormous underlying intellectual challenges in the development and revision of such a technology. AI is positioned at the core of the next gen software technologies in the market. Companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, and other leading players have actively implemented AI as a crucial part of their technologies.

So, with major tech companies such as Google, IBM, and Microsoft offering Artificial Intelligence solutions… How is it that an unheard-of OTC company like Sonasoft was able to launch its AI solution, and so quickly secure **a Fortune 1000 Tech Company** as their FIRST customer, within 1 year of launching the technology? The Company has been holding its cards closely, but this fact alone in my opinion, speaks volumes for the potential here. Company’s on the Fortune 1000 list would TYPICALLY use the solutions by other providers on the “Fortune” list… So, what happened? At this point, we can only speculate.

Here is the information disclosed regarding the AI technology to date;

[https://www.sonasoft.com/products/artificial-intelligence-ai/](https://www.sonasoft.com/products/artificial-intelligence-ai/)

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Wins-Significant-Contract-to-Provide-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Solution-to-Fortune-1000-Tech-Company?id=211783](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-SSFT-Wins-Significant-Contract-to-Provide-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Solution-to-Fortune-1000-Tech-Company?id=211783)

Now after everything achieved throughout 2018, and the ongoing potential of the AI technology, and the revenue growth added by the Cornerstone Technologies acquisition, the company has recently released its 2019 Goals. Equally as ambitious as the 2018 goals, all of which they achieved.

Goals for 2019 (taken from Jan 10 2019 PR)

· **Additional Acquisitions &amp; Mergers**

The Company intends to acquire at least one more company in 2019, but it may acquire up to three companies if there is a strong value proposition. The Company has entered negotiations with two complementary companies which would add significant value to the organization. Sonasoft is looking for perfect fits that will strengthen its intellectual property (IP) and boost immediate bottom-line revenue as well as deliver an overall profit.

**They have already announced LOI to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) software company, Hotify Inc., on January 31, 2019**

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Corp-SSFT-Signs-Letter-of-Intent-LOI-to-Acquire-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Company-Hotify-Inc?id=217086](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Corp-SSFT-Signs-Letter-of-Intent-LOI-to-Acquire-Artificial-Intelligence-AI-Company-Hotify-Inc?id=217086)

· **Emphasis on Enterprise Market Accounts**

The Company is shifting away from the SMB market and moving towards larger enterprise-sized accounts. This is a natural progression for the business following the 2018 acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies and its strategic partnership with Exterro, the recognized leader in the eDiscovery and legal software market. Sonasoft’s eDiscovery and email archiving solutions are ready for the enterprise market. The recently announced customer-win of NHL team, the San Jose Sharks, where Sonasoft’s solution displaced a leading enterprise-level competitor clearly demonstrates that Sonasoft can compete and become a key player in this market.

· **Expand on the Strategic Partnership with Exterro**

The Company intends to expand on its strategic partnership with Exterro. The Company will further integrate its SonaVault Archiving and eDiscovery Solution to enhance Exterro’s Orchestrated E-Discovery Suite. This will make the Company’s own IP solution a high-value proposition that is expected to increase revenue in the enterprise market.

· **Expand Its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform &amp; Increase Sales**

Sonasoft further intends to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) platform to offer new solutions to an array of industry needs. As announced last year, the Company won a major contract from a Fortune 1000 Tech Company to increase the accuracy of its online technical support search portfolio to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction. For 2019, the Company also intends to offer AI-based solutions that will predict and then prevent non-performing assets in the financial sector, forecast sales and revenue, calculate the demand for support, and apply other predictive applications to real business challenges. The Company has already tested these enhanced AI functionalities and is currently engaged with potentially interested enterprise customers to adopt them.

· **Increase Revenue**

Following the acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies, the launch of its AI Solution, and after securing a number of large customers last year, the Company projects significant revenue increases for 2019 compared to 2018. Further, the Company continues to press forward with the sales process for its AI solution, targeting large enterprise customers and has a number of deals progressing well. With all of this considered, it is difficult to accurately forecast revenues, however, the potential is enormous. As the year progresses, the Company intends to release its revenue predictions for 2019 year-end.

· **Strategic Marketing Initiatives**

Sonasoft has engaged with a marketing firm to add a stream of fresh and engaging content to position itself as a thought leader in the eDiscovery and Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. The goal is to increase enterprise-level leads, awareness of the brand and its products, and position itself as a recognized leader in the industry through organic SEO and various other forms of marketing and online advertising.

Some pretty massive forward-looking statements again! While the majority are targeting further exponential growth initiatives, one of the most exciting for current shareholders might be the “Strategic Marketing Initiatives”. If implemented effectively, this could potentially be the initiative which lights the fuse propelling the share price north!

Importantly, the share structure remains tightly held, with a low float and undervalued market cap;

**Share Structure**

Market Cap (as of 1/18/2019) 17,698,820

Outstanding Shares (as of 1/18/2019) 181,489,129

Float (as of 8/23/2018) 60,196,672\*

\*The company released press release overviewing the share structure and public float on 6/13/2018 where it was stated that the majority of the float was locked up by “insiders, employees, friends/family, and/or long-term stakeholders.  Therefore, the majority of the outstanding share count AND the public float is locked up by insider restrictions, restricted shares, or being held firmly by long-term shareholders.  The Company further estimates that the **remaining public float remains tight at approximately 13 million shares**.” Source: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Provides-Overview-of-Corporate-Share-Structure-and-Public-Float?id=195329](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/SSFT/news/Sonasoft-Provides-Overview-of-Corporate-Share-Structure-and-Public-Float?id=195329)

**Summary**

With all of the above considered, it is no wonder that some investors are very **BULLISH** on **SSFT** and consider it to be insultingly **UNDER-VALUED**. **SSFT** has near-term growth potential which could carry through to long term consistent revenue and asset growth. With an expanding management team of seasoned professionals, as well as the continued growth of existing revenue streams plus 1 completed and 1 pending strategic acquisitions in some of the fastest growing sectors, it is safe to speculate that the potential for this company and its stock to be nearly **LIMITLESS**.

It can be safely assumed that some big investors will be watching very closely to this company as it continued maneuvering through the AI and technology sectors moving forward.

Definitely one to keep on close watch.
