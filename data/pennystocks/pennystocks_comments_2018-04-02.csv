I zoom out on the chart to make sure the price bounces around a decent bit instead of steadily declining constantly. Look at the HCEI chart for example. I bought 90% of my shares at .0005 because it was near all time lows, no dilution, low float, and had a habit of popping. 

That's the safest plays I've been able to find in the OTC, but you have to figure out a strategy that works for you. I would just suggest ignoring any ""buzz"" you hear on social media like twitter, facebook, ihub etc. Once people start shilling their stock it's likely too late to get in for a safe profit, but that's not always the case. I use this as a rule of thumb for a safer investing strategy...but I'm also very patient. I don't mind waiting on a bid for 6 months before flipping for a 100% gain in another 6 months. 

OTC traders are the least patient human beings in the world. Most trade down at these levels for the prospect of the next 10 or 100 bagger which do come along with a relative frequency...but most traders will just chase the current trend and cash out of plays at a loss that will eventually pop up again.

I realize I'm rambling here, but I wish you the best of luck. If you have any more specific questions I'm happy to provide any insight I can offer.
