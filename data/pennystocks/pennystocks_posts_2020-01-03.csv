**American Rural Areas Don’t Have Speedy Broadband !**

**“Life in the Slow Lane”** 

**Welcome to the Internet in Rural America**

""… my download speed is crawling along at 0.61 Mbps. Five hours later, at 4:21 p.m., it's only 2.12 Mbps.”

 

“ By the Federal Communications Commission's latest estimate, which uses figures from 2016, 24 million Americans, or 7.7 percent of the population, are going without.”

 

“In rural areas it's far worse. Roughly 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high-speed broadband, compared with just 4 percent of urban Americans, the FCC said.”

 

*SOLUTION:*  
    
    
  

**The Microsoft Airband Initiative** 

 

Ruralink Wireless **$RVR.C** in partnership with Ark Multicasting and Microsoft is building 130 regional wireless broadband networks in rural USA providing (ISP) internet services to 44 million rural residents.

 

“We partner with equipment makers, internet and energy access providers, and local entrepreneurs to make affordable broadband access a reality for communities around the world.”

“Elimination of the broadband gap requires deployment of low-cost technology at scale. We support businesses working to increase internet and energy access and make it more affordable. Partnerships include co-investment and access to resources like technology, digital skills, and reseller programs.”

I believe the 1 year 85% drop is somewhat justified, coming from what they were valued at, but presents a great buying opportunity in a growth-oriented business. I attribute the 85% drop in share price over the past year to a ""failed"" buyout attempt and the recent fall, from $8 to $5, on tariffs taking a toll on the bottom line. At Home currently operates 214 retail locations and has plans to expand to 600 retail locations in the long-term. The company is currently averaging around 25 new locations per year and management believes they can continue to grow the store base at a compounded annual growth rate of between 15% and 20%. They are cash flow positive and are aiming to become the leading low-cost provider in home decor.

Excerpt from recent 10-K ( [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1646228/000155837019002487/home-20190126x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1646228/000155837019002487/home-20190126x10k.htm) Page 8)

&gt;""Our store growth is supported by new store economics that we believe are compelling. Our new stores generate an average of approximately $7 million of net sales within the first full year of operations and reach maturity within the first six months. On average, our new store sites which are leased or purchased require approximately $3 million to $4  million of net investment and our new build stores require approximately $2 million to $3 million of net investment  (net of sale leaseback proceeds). We have delivered an average payback period of approximately two years for our new leased and purchased stores and less than one and a half years for our new build stores.""

In conclusion, for $350m, you're getting a company with tangible assets equating to almost 900m and is growing this assets base by a consistent 15% annually. Not only is the asset base growing, but earnings have grown 20% annually over the past 5 years, meaning you're also buying into a company at a P/E of 8 that will continue growing earnings between 15 and 20% annually.

Over the next year, assuming the bottom line gets ironed out, I can easily see $HOME trading at a market cap of above $500m. If buyout roomers are true, we could be seeing prices between $700m and $900m. (Fair Value of Assets: $8 per share or $500m market cap; Buyout Rumors: $15 per share or $961m market cap)
