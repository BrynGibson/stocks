I haven't been able to dig extensively (checking up on all the management) but I will say, they have an app out and the reviews aren't all S*** or fake.

Dear Valued Shareholder,

As our recent communications have outlined, we are transitioning into a vertically integrated CBD producer and retailer. We are extremely grateful to our committed shareholders for joining us on this exciting journey. Today, I wanted to bring you up to date on what we have accomplished and what our next steps will be.

First off, our new website is up and live. You can find it at ftegco.com. Be sure to check back often to follow our progress there.

Next, I am very excited to announce that we are making strong progress on acquiring our new state-of-the-art CBD extraction and production facility. We have sharply narrowed down our list of top candidates with the goal of closing on a facility by next month. This is an enormously important piece of the puzzle for setting our fully integrated vision in motion. We will be outfitting the facility with a high-capacity supercritical CO2 extraction machine along with other essential equipment and moving quickly into production.

I am also very excited to report that we will be launching our own distribution facility in Phoenix, AZ. That facility should be fully up and running by April 2 - and possibly sooner than that. This will be our distribution hub and will serve as a primary sourcing point for all of our major end markets, including full-spectrum high-potency CBD products, a range of pet products, and our Bacteria Elimination cleaning products.

With our new emphasis on the rapidly growing CBD market, it's easy to forget that we have tremendous traction in the hi-tech cleaning products marketplace. Our Clean Life brand uses advanced Nano-mechanics to destroy pathogens and leave a protective shield (our ""Advanced Coating Technology"") on surfaces to inhibit the growth of new pathogens where treatment with Clean Life products has occurred - all without the use of harsh or harmful chemicals.

If you want to understand more about our cleaning products, our technology, or the science behind this process, please visit our Clean Life products site at cleanlifecorp.com.

Finally, I wanted to update our recent moves to expand our CBD retail footprint. We will be interfacing with end-market consumers in a range of ways, as we have noted in recent communications. Two of the most powerful avenues are our CBD mall kiosks and CBD vending machines.

Our mall kiosk strategy will focus on both human CBD products and pet products, including CBD for pets, which is a surprisingly powerful growth market. It shouldn't be surprising if you take a moment to think about it. CBD is an extremely effective agent on so many fronts for animal physiology given its interaction with the endocannabinoid system. Those same CB1 and CB2 receptors that have such an impact on our own physiology are present in our furry friends as well. And most pet owners desire natural, organic products that increase the well-being of their pets.

To give you a sense of how big this market could become, pet owners spent over $30B in 2016 on pet supplies, treatments, and veterinary care, according to the American Pet Products Association. Some percentage of that spending is a substitution target for CBD products.

Our first kiosk will focus on human CBD products. Our second will focus on the pet market.

In addition, our Las Vegas retail footprint will be open and active beginning next week. We also plan to expand aggressively into the Arizona and Florida markets next.



Best Regards,

Nelson Grist, CEO

TAMPA, FL, March 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE ‚Äì Enviro-Serv Inc. (USOTC: EVSV) (‚ÄúEVSV‚Äù), as announced in October 2018 as part of its planned initiatives to aggressively enter into the 10 Billion dollar Hemp industry, proudly announces its formal plans to farm hemp in Wisconsin commencing in May 2019 and unveils those plans in detail herein.

Chris Trina, Chairman and CEO of Enviro-Serv, Inc., has these comments about today‚Äôs announcement, ‚ÄúToday marks a huge day for the shareholders of EVSV as we aggressively move forward to planting and harvesting CBD Hemp in the coming months ahead as we take a strong foot hold in Wisconsin a state that is very proactive in Hemp cultivation. Please see timeline and details of the progression of the operation below‚Äù:

* January 28th,¬†2019- Applied for Industrial Hemp Growers license with the Wisconsin Dept. of Agriculture
* February 6th, 2019- Received Industrial Hemp approval license # 477788 from Dept. of Agriculture (usually takes 8 weeks we were successful in fast tracking the approval)
* February 7th, 2019- Successfully raised $100,000 of direct investment capital for the funding of the Wisconsin Hemp Project
* February 14th, 2019- Met In person with prominent Beaver Dam, WI. Businessman and farm land owner Dick Cromheecke to discuss a land lease of his available 29 acres to grow hemp (Mr. Cromheecke‚Äôs Dad grew hemp in Beaver Dam in the 1940‚Äôs he was very excited to partake)
* February 24th-26th,¬†2019- Attended the U.S. Central Hemp Expo in Rochester MN. To find quality seed procurement and consulting partners
* February 27th,¬†2019- Visited farm land in person and spent time in Beaver Dam meeting with local Farming Co-ops and viewing available warehouse and office space-retained real estate agent
* March 6th, 2019- Signed legal formal land lease with Dick Cromheecke to retain 29 farm-able¬†acres for the purpose of Hemp cultivation in Beaver Dam Wisconsin pursuant to acceptable upcoming soil testing results
* March 12th, 2019- Enviro-Serv, Inc. announces the hiring of Thomas Conine (see below)

Enviro- Serv is proud to announce the hiring and on-boarding of newly named Vice President-Midwest Farming operations Mr. Thomas Conine of Whitney Farms in Perronville, MI.¬†

Chris Trina stated this about his new member of the team, ‚ÄúThomas and I spent a great deal of time together brainstorming at the recent Rochester, MN hemp expo and I quickly realized we need a man like him to run the everyday operations of our hemp farming efforts in Beaver Dam. Thomas carries with him the knowledge, dedication, and work ethic to make this a hugely successful endeavor. Although I will be up there personally full time commencing in May through the harvest season I couldn‚Äôt have found a more perfect fit for the Wisconsin puzzle.‚Äù

Mr. Conine had this to stay to the investing public, ‚ÄúI am very impressed with Mr. Trina and happy to learn about Enviro- Serv‚Äôs initiatives in different states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Florida. I am very excited that they are publicly traded and to my knowledge were the only publico at the entire Hemp expo. I also love the ambition Enviro- Serv has and the ability to not just get these programs quickly up and running, but the efficiency and sustainability they have ingrained into the business for the long term.‚Äù

Conine also added, ‚ÄúMr. Trina and I have been working and collaborating closely with one another since we met at the Central US Hemp Expo in Rochester, MN. ¬†We started talking hemp and we both knew we were on to a tremendous opportunity working together and taking the company‚Äôs new Hemp motto ‚ÄúGo Farm Hemp-Let‚Äôs Grow Together‚Äù to a whole new level. I‚Äôm very excited to see what 2019 will bring us here at Enviro Serv. and look forward to hitting the ground running in April.‚Äù¬†

Today they've got news on what appears to be a move toward US distribution. So for the distribution partner, PTNYF, could this help them get a foot into the US markets now?

CHOOF + PTNYF deal specifics: 

[ParcelPal Signs Agreement for Marijuana Distribution With Choom Holdings Inc.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parcelpal-signs-agreement-marijuana-distribution-132700525.html)

The Company received the agreement from Choom for the establishment of distribution from various retail outlets in Canada . The initiative will consist of:

1. Distribution: ParcelPal and Choom will jointly develop the optimal roadmap for distribution within various provinces for adult use cannabis.
2. Accessibility: Using Choom's and ParcelPal's platform to enhance user experience and accessibility to products offered.
3. Compliance: ParcelPal and Choom will ensure that all products will be delivered will be within the parameters set forth by all regulating bodies in Canada .
4. Safety: ParcelPal and Choom are dedicated to public safety by enabling safe access to product for consumers through an instant delivery channel; eliminating impaired driving.

Just looking for some extra speculation because for both Choom and ParcelPal, I feel like anything that Choom does to expand its retail footprint, it could bring Parcel along for the ride...notwithstanding any other deals that each one of them have independently.",2019-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b06yhw/more_good_news_from_choof_american_distribution/
