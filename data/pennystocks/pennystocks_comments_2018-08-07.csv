Pullback was due to unreasonably high expectations. Possibly due to new investors that jumped in during the Russell 2K surge. Could see more of a pullback in the short-term but long-term signs are still positive.

I'm sitting on the $5 October I sold for $.90 for 1k shares worth so if it stays flat or it goes down my buy in is $4.10 when I would have bought in today at 4.75, so worst case scenario I saved 17% of the possible loss.
