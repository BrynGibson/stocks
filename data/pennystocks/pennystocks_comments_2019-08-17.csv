I understand your view here.  Mining is never something that happens overnight, there are regulations, planning, etc.  They recently secured water permits so they are making progress towards being able to mine.  As far as selling what they mine, it's high grade molybdenum of course they'll be able to sell it.

&gt; DD seems like a buzz word used by GURUs and marketers to aid in  confirmation bias rather than objective-based seeking. I have no vested  interest in this stock, so I wish you the best of luck and hope the 50%  drop in the past month is nothing more than a mis-calculation by  speculators. 

The recent 50% drop is due to their china partner bailing.  Which simply leaves the door for a new and better partner to step in, especially since now they have the water permits in place.

Yeah I get it, you make some valid points but the risk/reward ratio is here IMHO.  If this company goes bust I lose 20 cents per share.  If this company starts mining it can go to $4 to $5 in the long run.  Plus the value of their assets in a sale should still leave plenty of room for shareholders to collect on.

I might also add that they fully own the liberty project as well in addition to the 80% percent ownership of Mt. Hope.

Link to their liberty project:  [http://www.generalmoly.com/assets/liberty/](http://www.generalmoly.com/assets/liberty/)

There's over a billion pounds of Moly at stake surely it can't be that hard to find a partner that's interested in the project.  Or perhaps a prime target for a total sale of the company and all assets.  I believe the company has too much going for it to go completely bust.",2019-08-17
