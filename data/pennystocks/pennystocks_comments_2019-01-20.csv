We use to pump that shit from 1cent to 3cents and then sell. Repeat. Here’s the deal I’ve done penny stocks for a decade now and I can tell you there’s probably a handful of companies I’ve seen make it out and are still here today. These companies are either garbage, or the product is useless now, or they committed some type of fraud. That’s why there traded for pennies. All there here for is to be pumped and dumped. Unfortunately we move to company to company when we do, we typically spot companies that are awhile away from their RS. Because once that happens you’re probably fucked. But they typically reverse split near there delist date. Because they’ll have to be over $1 for a week to stay in compliance. ",2019-01-20

6,blackcloud001,eejmbu3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ahu9mz/new_subreddit_for_small_cap_stocks/eejmbu3/,1,"I don’t know a whole lot, but one that I’ve been playing back and forth is SND (Smart Sand).
SND has gotten riskier, as they are a white frac sand producer, from their facility in Wisconsin.
The industry is very debt oriented in their capital structures, but SND has little debt, which I was drawn to originally.
To the risky aspect of SND:
A lot of competition has been getting into the industry, as the company has been supplying the fracking in the Permian Basin. The sand in the Permian is brown sand, a lesser quality sand that “may” make production for larger well sites more expensive as using brown lesser quality sand may fuck up the yield of these well/drill sites.
HCLP (another safer company which I’m kicking myself in not diversifying myself in), is also a white frac sand company, that landed a contract to supply CHK with their production.
There is very little media coverage on SND which I don’t like.
They invested in rail in the Bakken region, which will be booming like the Permian if oil prices continue rising (not sure at what prices per bbl that would be), and it makes economic sense to ramp up production.
Again, the big threat is brown sand in the Permian, and the company failing to secure supplying contracts with production sites. The company’s management has been able to beat expectations, despite other similar competitors missing expectations.
Valuations are very good. Take a look at fundamentals and nuff said. To all your own due diligence, but I feel like I got the ball rolling enough.",2019-01-20

I like your enthusiasm in thinking it would have been great if they could have just done all the clinical trials at once, but that is often not practical for lots of reasons. The company probably thought with the funding and resources they had at the time the clinical trials that they selected to do were the ones which would put them in the best possible position in the future, given all the circumstances.   The company has been regularly seceding in various clinical trials around the globe for various treatments using the Recell system or its variants, and is now in a great position for finding some real monetary benefits around the globe for burns and in non us countries for vitiligo and chronic wounds.   I certainly expect them to keep up with these milestones and fill out the needed clinical trials in the US in the near term probably starting in the first half of this year. IMO",2019-01-20
