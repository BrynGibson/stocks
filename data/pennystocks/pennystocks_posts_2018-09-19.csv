[GrowLife, Inc.](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrowlifeinc.com%2F&amp;esheet=51869122&amp;newsitemid=20180919005202&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=GrowLife%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=6a7cb90a2337a6fa913a84fb70000a2a) (OTCQB: PHOT), one of the nation‚Äôs most recognized indoor cultivation product and service providers, today announced details of its proposed Rights Offering that would allow the company‚Äôs shareholders to acquire additional shares of common stock (the ‚ÄúOffering‚Äù). The Offering is designed to give record shareholders the opportunity to invest directly into PHOT at a set price with additional warrants to support the company‚Äôs capital raise to be used for continued expansion.

‚ÄúWe have some of the most committed and passionate shareholders in our industry, and we are excited to offer them the ability to directly invest in GrowLife in a manner similar to large-scale investors,‚Äù said GrowLife CEO Marco Hegyi. ‚ÄúWe have experienced tremendous growth and expansion over the last year. New markets are emerging almost daily and to remain competitive and continue to capture market share, we needed to continue to innovate our product offering while expanding our footprint across North America.

‚ÄúThis Offering is intended to not only reward our long-time shareholders, but to generate the additional capital needed to complete our vertical grow system development and go-to-market programs with sales and marketing, acquisitions, and resources necessary to expand the company thereby capitalizing on the momentum our industry and company are experiencing. Our new systems, which are testing well are entering our second and third phases including AI software development, are designed to reduce the costs associated with large-scale cannabis production and we hope will create a significant new revenue stream for the company,‚Äù added Hegyi.

SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING

* Each shareholder will receive one non-transferable right (the ‚ÄúRight‚Äù) for each share of common stock held on the record date (October 12, 2018).
* Each Right will include one share of Common Stock and two one-half warrants at a subscription price of $0.012. The purchase price will be payable in cash to the company.
* The warrants included in each Right will be exercisable for one-half of the number of rights for one share of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.018 per share and one-half warrant exercisable for one share of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.024. For example: if you subscribe for 100 Units you will receive 100 common stock shares and 100 warrants divided into 50 warrants exercisable at $0.018 and 50 warrants exercisable at $0.024).
* Record date shareholders who fully exercise their Subscription Rights will be eligible for an over-subscription privilege entitling these shareholders to subscribe, subject to certain limitations and a pro-rata allotment, for any additional shares of common stock not purchased pursuant to the Subscription.
* The Offering expires at 6:00 PM Eastern Time on November 12, 2018, unless extended.
* The company expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the Rights and a copy of the prospectus for the Offering to record date shareholders beginning on September 18, 2018. Financial Advisors will likely send notices to you shortly thereafter.

&amp;#x200B;

ATLANTA, Sept. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- True Nature Holding, Inc. (OTCQB:[TNTY](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KJgw7MLh6BuYpi8WsxiT_zwIjuHhqqml0zR9V8MfKUJZD2DCs1aj5xtg6hgrv_mppNL4mHyiTO23Y2APvpJv9Q==)) (the ""Company"" or ""True Nature"") today further expanded on its strategy to take advantage of the opportunities in the healthcare information technology space, and provided a series of examples of the projects it is evaluating to showcase the scope and potential in digital products and services. The Company has several acquisitions it believes are in the final stages of due diligence and expects announcements on definitive agreements and closings shortly.  


‚ÄúSince announcing our shift into healthcare applications and technology, we have been presented countless opportunities to evaluate. The idea of ‚Äústitching together threads of opportunity‚Äù seems to be catching on, and with the large number of creative and thoughtful entrepreneurs who have created digital solutions, we think we can start with a great team and build from there,‚Äù said Louis DeLuca, COO for True Nature Holding. He continued, ‚ÄúWe are expecting to make over $10 million in new business investments over the next few months, and if the market provides the interest and support necessary, we believe we could see $20 million of investments in 2019. Companies like Textron and Thermo Fisher Scientific have created an excellent model to follow, acquiring and incubating technologies, and providing dividend and enhanced earnings through future ‚Äúspin-outs‚Äù.¬† We believe this is a fine model to aspire toward, and if we can provide a fraction of the success these models have created we will have done well for our shareholders.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúBeing small and nimble makes it easy for us to make quick strategic decisions and creates openings for tomorrow‚Äôs executives to come in and grow, learning the public company world from the ground floor. We plan to employ some of the best and brightest young talent and complementing them with senior and experienced executives. We believe mentoring the young ‚Äúup and comers‚Äù while growing the business, both organically and through acquisition, can give us a long and stable growth path. While we are targeting $20 million in revenue run rate for the near term, we believe $100 million or more is achievable in this market with the right mix of new technologies and business relationships.‚Äù   
The Company is highlighting these examples of new applications that they expect to be delivering with strong revenue streams over the next 12 months:

* Voice applications using Amazon Alexa in geriatric situations for complex data gathering and monitoring, as well as simple reminders of medication, dietary and exercise;
* Real time video and digital communications to underserved communities to support both diagnostic and treatment needs at lower costs for both the patient and the insurers;
* Personal healthcare records closely integrated with provider-based records from both large, traditional healthcare providers with historical data bases such as the VA Healthcare System and new, discipline specific applications including dentistry, dermatology, heart health and diabetics;
* Applications of augmented reality to train the patients in self-diagnostics, and the providers in the use of new technology-based solutions, with real time situational modeling and reinforcement of desired outcomes;
* Application of actuarial analysis to assist in decision making for both economic and medical outcomes in the human and pet marketplaces.

In conjunction with these changes the Company will be ‚Äúreinventing‚Äù its executive team from the top down. Dr Jordan Balencic, the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be stepping down at the end of the quarter, and the Company has accepted the resignation of Jay Morton, the President and Interim CEO, to make room for the new CEO and a new President. ‚ÄúWe have also been interviewing candidates for our CFO position and expect to make that choice public over the next few weeks,‚Äù explained DeLuca, a former Home Depot executive who has been instrumental in constructing the expansion plans. ‚ÄúWe should all be ‚Äúself-obsoleting‚Äù by virtue of the growth of our newest executives and, while sharing our historical experiences, when the time is right, we need to step aside to let the ‚Äúcream rise to the top‚Äù. All of the TNTY team is proud to have had a chance to contribute to the process and will continue to support our new team in any manner possible.‚Äù

**The Mission of True Nature Holding, Inc.**   
To leverage new technologies and services to improve healthcare and outcome for individuals, their families and their pets. We believe we can reduce the cost of healthcare, while improving the quality of life using Telehealth and Telemedicine Solutions.  


We are building healthcare applications that focus on: patient engagement, care coordination, remote monitoring, data analytics, and may include Blockchain RX(TM) to provide applications for market participants in healthcare through the encryption of sensitive data as a service bureau.  


Our approach is to develop these business opportunities as individual ""threads"" in response to client needs, ultimately creating an end-to-end set of solutions from the end user up to the healthcare provider or veterinary professional. Further, we expect to assist suppliers to the healthcare industry by allowing them to access unique technologies that bind them with their clients in a ""top-down"" distribution model.  


We recognize it will take the investment of major market participants like Apple, Amazon, IBM, hospitals, healthcare networks, pharmacy and other providers for us to achieve critical mass. In consideration of this reality, we expect to work with these market makers in collaboration and in support of the ultimate user, the individual and their pets. The day of ""direct-to-consumer"" healthcare, including ""the humanization of our pets"" is upon us and we hope to be key parties to their evolution and success.
