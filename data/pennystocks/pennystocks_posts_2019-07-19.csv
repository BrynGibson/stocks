If you want to, go ahead and take or don't take my advice today and if you do well, go ahead and do or don't consider tipping.  My portfolio consists of funds received doing photoshop work for people on Reddit.

Just want to start out by saying that I am still very new to trading, and am not planning on using real money any time soon. I have been paper trading daily for around a month now, and have used a strategy that involves finding the stocks that have gapped up the most (% wise) pre-market, researching the news that caused the spike, and if it fits my criteria, shorting them on market open. I am generally out by 9:50 at the latest.

What are the main risks of this? I realize penny stocks are extremely volatile, but so far I rarely see any that actually continue to climb on market open. Is this just dumb luck? Or is it just hard for a stock to maintain its price after such a huge spike?

I feel confident in this approach, but not confident enough to go in with real money. What can I do to make this a more reliable/safe strategy?",2019-07-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cfadvb/successful_paper_trading_but_seems_too_good_to_be/
