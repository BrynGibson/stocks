If you're swinging and get stuck, licensing deals will likely follow good results, so I wouldn't panic sell. They are also eligible to be designated a breakthrough drug allowing them to market during the required P3 trials so that news would also let you unload.

They've never once brought either a vaccine or treatment to market.

They have pumped and dumped almost every outbreak.

It's quite possible they could, they have the ability and manufacturing capability, but I have no reason to have faith they actually will.

I said this at $3, I said it at $2, and I'm saying it again now because I hate to watch people get wiped out on such a low likelihood of success.

Of course, I could be dead wrong, lord knows I have been before, but I haven't been with IBIO so far. If it hits $.30-$.40, I'll probably consider entering for their manufacturing capabilities.

Good luck.

Most average people getting involved in stocks have no idea what they're getting into or even how the market works. The fact that they're using margin is super risky and the whole reason it's there is to make sure any dumbass out there can't go lose the banks money in 2 seconds. It goes both ways to protect people giving you the money and the individual. Considering this is a penny stock sub, the fact that someone would use margin with penny stocks is literal mental illness and that actually makes wallstreetbets look normal.

For penny stocks you have to understand the way the majority of them operate and the risks that are involved : r/S \&gt;  Dilution &gt; De-listing, and the advantages : pre-R/S run-up ( very common ), post-dilution offer close (reliable base of support), more volatility and reward potential.

If your comfortable with technical analysis you can catch stocks that are ready to move and just have to wait for increasing or above average volume to time your entry.  

Oil Plays and Retail are currently the groups with the most amount of speculation, given the economic environment and will provide the greatest volatility and potential for profit.

With Technical analysis, calculate your entry and potential exit, and order the trades according to potential profit, hold periods etc.

I follow a trader who suggested what he did when he was starting to make real money - that he would keep his account at a minimum of $10k. So if one week the account totaled $13,867 he would transfer $3,867 and repeat that until he comfortably quit his job. Eventually he would grow that account by cutting down on expenses, and now has the account sitting at $100k doing the same method.

Selling as soon as market opens and hope to recover atleast some change :(
It’s still up ~5% after market so hoping for the best. But if I do lose it all I won’t be too sad, this stock market has become an addiction and hopefully I’m not dumb enough to keep going if I lose more. Good luck to you and may the stonks go up in your future",2020-04-10

There was some minor dilution going on with this stock.
It'll be over soon. As with all pennies. Make your profit and run with free shares. You've got to know when to hold them and know when fold them. Thanks goes out to Kenny R. for that quote.",2020-04-10
