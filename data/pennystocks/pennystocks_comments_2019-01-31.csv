You're not wrong.  

But we're talking OTC long term here.  That's true for....all of them.  With some though, if you can afford it, you take the chance and hold.  I know their debt ratio is 400%, and with most other companies I'd be selling already.  I'm up almost $180 on them right now.  Literally a 96% return.  

Every once and a while though I like to take a risk and I've got a gut feeling with SHMP, which 9 times out of 10 is meaningless, but I can afford the loss if it happens.",2019-01-31

Think about it from a practical standpoint.
If anyone who is anyone wants to starts ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù, are they going to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway?

Fuck no.

Sure, unless they‚Äôre loaded. A share of Berkshire Hathaway costs over $100k.

Is the average person going to invest in Amazon?

Fuck no.

Shares are still to high to purchase anything. If a person has 5k in savings, are they really going to feel cool purchasing 2-3 shares of Amazon, or would they rather purchase 5,000 shares of a company nobody ever heard of at $1 a share?

A lot of people aren‚Äôt educated in investing, so can you blame them for mistaking a $5 pps company with a $1 billion market cap being more valuable than a $60 company also valued at $1 billion?

Perhaps there is also less liquidity risk in the $5 share company. From a trading perspective, maybe it‚Äôs more valuable to trade something that has a tighter bid-ask spread.

I don‚Äôt think it has to do with value, and I don‚Äôt think it only pertains to Americans.

Ask any person walking on the street in your country what they think is better, $5 pps or $100 pps without any context, and I bet more than half the time, you‚Äôre going to get people choose the $100 being more valuable and the $5 being less valuable as well. Without any context, the $100 pps naturally seems ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, but less affordable, implying there is less growth available than the $5 stock, which seems more affordable and has more potential for becoming a $100 stock itself in the future.",2019-01-31

You have a lot to learn young jedi, but don't steal and/or take credit for other people's hard work. 

FWIW you'll make more long-term if you focus on trading quality stocks via setups by using options. Basically the equivalent of pennies but with real liquidity.
