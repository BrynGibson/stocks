The FDA has authorized lab tests (i.e. Roche, Thermo Fisher) in as little as 24 hours. However, they have yet to authorize a point of care product (i.e. Aytu). The odd part is that the Trump Administration has gone out of their way to say that no point of care test exists and that development of one would take 6 months. Highly suspicious.

This is all the filings for IBIO. Form 4, and other ownership filings, typically are meaningless. Before someone hounds me with an example about why this isn't the case, let me explain. Here are some things we know for certain:

* We cannot read Isett Thomas Francis' mind

* We don't know why he's buying

* He's bought before.

The first problem is you don't know what he's thinking. To conjecture the meaning behind the previous Form 4 filings would've failed on IBIO. Over the long-term, this is basically a game of putting your money on black or red. A guessing game, and placing unnecessary meaning onto something that is likely frivolous. He's also bought before, and nothing happened.
