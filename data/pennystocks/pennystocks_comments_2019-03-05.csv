26,MentalTadpole,ehtjq89,/r/pennystocks/comments/axgoec/upcoming_plays/ehtjq89/,1,"I do, yes. But it depends what you are looking for.

I'm in for the long haul. SSFT is a REAL company, with a long history of services major names in the tech industry. 

30+ employees, 2 offices, and a huge revenue increase is expected on their upcoming financial statements (up to $13M expected compared to &gt;$1M for 2017) this is due to the acquisition on Cornerstone Technologies last year.

Further to that, they recently signed an LOI to acquire another company. An AI company which apparently has some hot technology and existing customers and revenue.

They are fully audited as well and fully up to date with reporting obligations on OTC.

But look into it yourself, their newsreel from the past 14 months is likely the hottest in the OTC. But until last week not many people were aware of them. I think it is worth the time to do the DD even if you ultimately decide it's not for you.

Good luck!!",2019-03-05

169,calvin50,ehw26tb,/r/pennystocks/comments/axp0vc/krfg_thoughts/ehw26tb/,1,"There’s a good chance it’s going to lose even more tomorrow morning. If you look at the last 3 days it’s dropped every morning. About 1 yesterday it started a steady fall and I believe it would have started climbing again but the market was in a downward trend this morning. Even if it drops tomorrow it should snap  Back to .004 . The way you can tell this is the RSI 
Every time it gets to around 30 it bounces . If you go back three days the stock bounces at the 30 . Today if you bring the RSI line up to 50 you find that it only crosses once  and touches a few times . If you go back the last couple of days it touches the 30 ( that’s where people want to buy . The price is irrelevant)but draw a line at the 50 . Big trends and some almost oversolds.
So we know this stock bounces at30( no stock is the same) and if it has volume will climb after 50 .we also know people want it because it doesn’t get to 20 . There wasn’t a panic sell today because it never got oversold.
So if I wanted to buy in this stock today I would watch the RSI as it went down while looking all the way back to the beginning of the spike . The first resistance is .0045 the second.0055 and so on . Those resistances are now support line but which one is strong. The support that people want to buy at is strong support. I believe that’s going to be the .0045 . It could fall through that tomorrow but it should come back to and float around it until it continues down or starts it’s uptrend back . It takes some practice with different stocks but all your looking for is what number is the buying going on",2019-03-05
