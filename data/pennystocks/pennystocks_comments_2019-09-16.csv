 ""One stock to keep an eye on is Kinross Gold (KGC). KGC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 15.48, while its industry has an average P/E of 20.66. Over the past 52 weeks, KGC's Forward P/E has been as high as 30.49 and as low as 14.91, with a median of 23.77.

Investors should also recognize that KGC has a P/B ratio of 1.26. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.82. Over the past year, KGC's P/B has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.66, with a median of 0.89.

Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. KGC has a P/S ratio of 1.87. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.71.

Finally, our model also underscores that KGC has a P/CF ratio of 8.09. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 31.59. Over the past 52 weeks, KGC's P/CF has been as high as 9 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 5.99.

These are only a few of the key metrics included in Kinross Gold's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, KGC looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.""

47,jpezzasco,f1kvssw,/r/pennystocks/comments/d525eg/hemp_inc/f1kvssw/,1,"I'm game....  
Let's start off with the question..  
Did you read the latest Quarterly from 8/19/19?  
Let's go back to something I said in a prior post.  


"" With a share structure like this, HEMP would need to be priced at $0.0014 to have any hope for upward movement. And that's if the OS is even remotely the same. By looking at the chart since the last time they filed anything (8/2017) I'd say it's way over the 754 million that's listed from 2 years ago. They have dumped a good bit of that 5.5 billion AS into it in that time. That's the only thing that explain the volume it's carried with no price movement (except down) since the last time they filed.""

The report they have posted from 8/19/19 confirms what I had said.

 ""Common stock: 10,500,000,000 common shares, $0.00001 par value 5,030169,697 and 4,551,373,511 shares issued""

So the AS is now 10.5 Billion shares, The OS is 5 Billion shares and the float is 4.5 Billion shares. Bruce has another 478 Million shares to dump on you before he has to start tapping into the AS that he has apparently doubled since 2016. Stocks are all about supply and demand and this one has way too much on the supply side. I'm not sure NASA could build a rocket to get this off the ground. It's going to need a healthy share reduction to have any upside for share holders. Other than that, they are unaudited financials that haven't been submitted to OTCmarkets and/or The SEC for a reason.  


Good luck with the bag you are holding, I hope it doesn't get any heavier.",2019-09-16
