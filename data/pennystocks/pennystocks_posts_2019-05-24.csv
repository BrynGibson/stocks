On top of that Workhorse Group is a top 3 candidate to receive the 6b contract with usps to build electric trucks to replace their operating vehicles.

MATT DWYER the ceo, had /has a string of different tickers that all seem to have the same assets and business plans. He has strung PRs along that are vague and does not follow upon them. Now, GCGX has an ihub bashing team with about 4 different screen names that all provide extremely detailed in depth information on this guy, and his failed tickers. They are more relentless then ive ever seen. All hours of the day. A consistent trading pattern developed and thats when i began to suspect that Dwyer the ceo could possibly be manipulating the stock because the timing was always just too perfect between the chart movement and PRs. Luckily i was able to make quite a lot when the good was good. GCGX appears to be nose diving and no money can be made because the volume and movement just isn't there. But the bashing just does not let up. My suspicion is the CEO is in on the bashing to kill all interests in the stock, so he can move onto the next ticker, rinse and repeat. They actually have some of the assets they claim in Sacramento, ive seen them. But i think they are misusing and misappropriating the money from selling shares. For the record ive been out for a while now, but can't help watch what is transpiring. Please anyone with insight if love to hear your opinions.",2019-05-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bsi2oc/gcgx_bashing_done_by_ceo/

I took the advice I saw in here because I had no clue what I was doing. I lost a lot of money.

I've learnt do day trade since then and have since earned back all the money I lost and am on the path to becoming a full time day trader. Gains from day trading penny stocks can be up to 100 dollars a day trading with a 1,500 dollar account. Day trading strategies as you get used to them also put you in a position where you can choose to trade with a high winning percentage. Long term investing is more of a gamble because some companies despite having good fundamentals may take over a decade to be noticed. Don't you want to profit now? Time and effort invested in to learning day trading strategies can and will earn you a lot of money if you stick with it. I've put some resources below for those who will heed my warning.



Youtube Channels I suggest:

15,A few question about my companies stock.,bsa5oh,cl70c200gem,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bsa5oh/a_few_question_about_my_companies_stock/,5,9,"Long story short, the company is laying off our center in July due to money issues.  The stock been on a steady decline for about three years.  It's a ISP.  Currently the stock is under $2 and about a year ago they did a reverse 15 to 1 stock split, I believe to keep some of the investors calm... (I think that was what they called it.)  With a couple years I expect one of two things to happen to the company: 1) They get bought out by a competitor. OR 2) Bankruptcy.  I think option one will happen due to use having a fairly large footprint with some decent infrastructure in some states. I do have money stashed away so hoping to make some money off the dying company if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm curious about is hypothetically, if ATT or Verizon bought the company in a few years is it likely that the stock will go up? For example, if Verizon bought the company would the stock price be the same as Verizons at that point?  2) If that does happen will the reverse stock split still be in play? ie; If I but one of our stock @ $2 and then Verizon buys it and they're at $50, will that turn into $750? ($50\*15)?

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies, if it doesn't make exact sense as I don't have to much experience in this field and just trying to see if it's possible to make a buck.  Thanks in advance.",2019-05-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bsa5oh/a_few_question_about_my_companies_stock/
