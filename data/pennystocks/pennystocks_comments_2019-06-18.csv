Let's see them uplist to the OTCQB first like they stated first.  

The last few weeks they've been putting out a lot of ""news"" but it hasn't really been anything I'd consider very substantial.  Volume has been low and pps has been dropping.  

I have a small position, about 10k I got around .027.  I might add another 10 or 20k if it gets under .025 this week.  


As much as people here are sick of hearing about this company, if it uplists to OTCQB gets a symbol change around the same time period, it's going to get pumped up way over it's 52 week high.  I could see it hit .50 plus.  

Is it worthwhile as a long term investment?  Who knows, probably not.  Very few companies are on the OTC.  

But if I can have around 30k shares, for under a grand, I'd be happy selling off 20k on that pump and letting 10k ride to see what happens.",2019-06-18

Bantek does not make drones, they resell them under a very good name ""Drone USA"". 

They have contracts with military operations, and that basically means government tax dollars pay their bills. 

If I was the CEO of Bantek, I would be diluting stock as much as I can so I could spend money to bring awareness to my brand, in hopes someone comes along and buys me out for my contacts, name, and government contracts. 

Technology in 2019+ is interesting. The biggest companies will throw money around to buy up the small guys. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft are just some of these companies that will overspend.

Stop and ask yourself the value of a drone company with government contracts and a very marketable name to go with it.

Does that appeal to Amazon? Maybe.

Also, with war tensions in Iran heating up, that doesn't exactly hurt military drones that get their funding from the defense department.

Again, I'm not a professional in this industry, but I do pay attention to trends. I could be way off mark, but the ability to own 1 million shares for $200 is a small gamble. Small risk huge reward.  in my opinion.",2019-06-18
