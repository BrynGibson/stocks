2,Ricky_Ravioli,e1nze79,/r/pennystocks/comments/8vk9af/what_is_your_penny_stock_invest_mothod/e1nze79/,1,"Pre-scan. I’m significantly worse when I try to jump into stocks. It leads to chasing also.

8:30 scan
9-915 I know what stocks I’m going after
9:30 only get involved with those.
10:30ish I’m finished with the others and if something new pop ups then I’ll go to that. 

I used to have a habit of jumping back and forth between stocks and now I just stick to the best ones. ",2018-07-02

It puts a lot of buy pressure on the stocks because all the ETFs and MFs have to then take up positions typically to benchmark. 
INNT. Someone dropped a tip on this last week. Bout some. Been riding it I averaged in own 300 shares ~23.1 

Looking at the largest holders of this stock makes me want to buy.

8,Guy_fieri98,e1o0i1e,/r/pennystocks/comments/8vk9af/what_is_your_penny_stock_invest_mothod/e1o0i1e/,1,"Either run top down or bottom up strategies, have had successes with both. 

Bottom up method:

-run equity screener, typically through Bloomberg progression EQS screen, screen based on fundamental metrics:
&gt;market 
&gt;industry
&gt;market cap (less than $100m as they are typically affected by information asymmetry and therefore misssed priced)
&gt;ev/ebitda (less than 5)
&gt;P/e (between 5 and 15)

Look at results, typically less than 50.

-look through results for a potential true undervalued company (low multiples don't as wells mean it's good)

-once a potential opportunity is found then I conduct a more detailed in depth analysis, qualitative and quantitative.

-define as valuation target price via the use of a discount cash flow valuation and comparables valuation, then sensitises to see variation an value and potential returns under both bull and bear cases. 

-If value is present then buy and hold until price target is met or adjust valuation target if variables change.

I'm long as i've been following since last year after a couple dudes hyped it up pretty heavily and i've been waiting and believing the news pretty religiously.

I've considered exiting a portion of my heaviest position in a tech company to purchase about 6k more shares but I would need RIBT to drop down to 2.25 before I would feel comfortable making that move. Especially with a hyped quarterly earnings coming up in a month.",2018-07-02

From my past experience with penny stocks, I take the gains when I get large run ups. Otherwise It can crash the next day and now your stuck with a loss. I would certainly wait for RIBT to cool off before jumping in further. 

I hate having to sell stocks that are doing well, but in some cases, its best to take some of those gains and find something that is looking for a turnaround etc. Once I get above 10&amp;#37; gain, I typically take some profit, if I really like the stock, I sold, I wait for it to come back and buy more.
