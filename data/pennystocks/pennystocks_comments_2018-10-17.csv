38,MorsiasRL,e7xqdfr,/r/pennystocks/comments/9oyvpa/whats_the_deal_with_hsgx/e7xqdfr/,1,"Actually just bought in pretty heavily to this. The massive drop from 2.00 that occurred on Sept. 5 stemmed from their Phase 3 Neocart results that they posted. They failed to meet the primary phase 3 endpoint that they had set for themselves. Despite this, the results they obtained showed a meaningfully significant improvement in both function and pain reduction over the alternative microfracture procedure. They very very narrowly missed hitting their own goal, missed it by 2 responses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm surprised that the stock tanked so exceptionally despite the trial having strong results in almost every category. The company very recently had a large public offering of additional stocks further complicating things. Despite all of this Neocart's results speak for themselves, it is relatively fast acting and often exceeds the capabilities of competing treatments. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the growth lately and the run up that we are seeing right now is completely based on the meeting with the FDA occurring on the 30th of this month. The FDA has much more lenient expectations then HSGX set for themselves. The ceo feels confident that the results they've obtained will be sufficient for approval. They are going to be discussing with the FDA the possibility of a BLA submission. People are beginning to rally around this stock, myself included. However HSGX is certainly running low on both time and funds. Time will tell if even Neocarts approval could completely turn things around. Exciting lead up to approval though!",2018-10-17

It will most likely surge with the meetings results and the possible scheduling of the BLA submission. Obviously if you could hold on until true approval occurs it could be quite lucrative. 

&amp;#x200B;

However based on everything I've seen they are certainly in debt at this point. They just made some $15 million off of the shares they offered. I'm fairly sure they will okay for the next 3-6 months. However long term they could be in serious trouble without further support or buyout. I'm not planning on holding for that long, perhaps up until the 30th or more likely waiting until approval if they seek it. Certainly concerned that the company could offer addition shares again in the future or facing the need to take out loans.

Even as I'm typing this it's popping quite heavily up 7% in the last 3 minutes. It is absolutely a risk but a lot of good things may very well be happening here soon. Results speak very clearly.

I have been with Avita for three years and a firm believer that the product should replace the current standard of care (skin-grafting) or at the very least be used in conjunction on every burn operation that requires grafting. A buy-out may seriously be on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in it for the long-term, I understand some on this forum are strictly here to trade. If your game was to trade Avita for a quick profit then you definitely missed the train. Part of the reason the FDA pop was not as big as some expected is because there were a lot of very cheap shares bought just months ago. The stock has doubled from it's 52 week low, we saw massive sell walls because people made a nice profit. The good news is most of those shares traded hands to (hopefully) longer-term holders. Now we wait for catalysts, they have already announced the first purchase orders to hospitals that have used RECELL via the compassionate use program.

&amp;#x200B;

I  am not sure why cannabis stock keep getting brought up with Avita, they are different industries and definitely do not move the same based on speculation.",2018-10-17
