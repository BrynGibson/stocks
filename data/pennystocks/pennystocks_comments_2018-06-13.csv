I am just curious why you using it?

IMO it is beginner level broker. I would only use it if I would be interested to buy and hold stocks because I haven't seen any other advantages.

I started following this sub when there was only something like 11k redditors and look at it know:)

I might place 10 trades a day if I’m scaling into various positions. It wasn’t long ago TDA was charging me $10 per trade. At the end of the year, those fees really add up. 

If ‘advanced’ features such as shorting, leverage, or OTC is a big part of your strategy then RH isn’t for you. 

As far as trading features go, all I really need is the ability to place Limit, Market, and Stop Loss Orders. All my main research is still done through the ThinkorSwim platform. ",2018-06-13

I should inform more about it and in this pos esspecially because it is key. But I do not know any pro short sellers so far that got bust by losing most of his/her accounts. It is more rookies or semi rookies mistake. But general rule of thumbs would be 1% and preset stop loss order should be put above resistance. Even very huge gap and without added preset stop loss order it would cost you 10% maybe at the worst 20% of your account on really really and very very unlucky trade, because the loss in short selling is as well a bit overhyped. But with 1% it  would be hard to damage account is you short selling from the tops. But for me even with huge gaps it didin't happened. Worst was 7% and that was bad I mean really bad. But considering losing 7% after wining 30% in two months it is really hurts but not too bad. Just do not bet too much it is simple rule but everybody still somehow let their emotions in play. And to finish here if you senior use put options - risk managed. Only hard to find nice put options but still locking your risk is great way to short sell.",2018-06-13
