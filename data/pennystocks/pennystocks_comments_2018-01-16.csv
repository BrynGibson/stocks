I’ve made quite a bit of $ from them, been in and out a few times since .68, the last few weeks have been a complete slaughter though. 

I like their outlooks with scooping up some other companies and finishing shipping all their miners out before end of Q1 (backordered issues)

Hope for the best I guess!",2018-01-16

My friend takes uber everyday in SF and gets a premium service for like 5 dollars a ride. Uber subsidizes his rides because he is a frequent user. 

Moviepass is working with a similar model, one that is very popular in the tech industry at the moment. Bleed cash to obtain the market, and once you've got it no one can beat you out. Its a long-term game. MP is planning on getting the majority of the movie patron market, and influencing the industry in their favor once they have it, but also giving life back to the dying industry.
