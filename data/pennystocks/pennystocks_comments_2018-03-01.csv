Penny stocks actually make sense to me so far. They make logical sense in the same way I know - based on news and market conditions - what will make 100,000 + people buy a subscription to a newsletter (the angle of which will either be fear or greed based).

When I write promotions I scour the news, judge general sentiment, and more to ensure I hit a nerve that sells the most financial advisory subscriptions and it has to be quick and relevant.

This process seems similar to judging what is driving a spike in a penny stock. Instead of seeing what makes them buy a subscription, I can gauge what is making them greed buy or fear sell a stock.

15,the_restlessartist,dv0i6ep,/r/pennystocks/comments/814k1m/just_finished_tim_sykes_how_to_make_millions_does/dv0i6ep/,1,"Eight years. I'm a Direct Response Copywriter. For the last two years I've worked exclusively with a billion dollar-plus international direct marketing publishing company (mainly in the financial niche). Before that I worked with some of the most successful online businesses in the world primarily in the health niche including the world's top three largest direct marketing companies: Agora, Boardroom (now Bottom Line, Inc), and Rodale. 

I've generated literal hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. I've taught classes and seminars on the subject. I've written books about it. I've used to get paid to teach it as well. 

So I've built up a really good, marketable skill that I feel comfortable with. 

However, the goal has always been to make lots of money abroad, from the comfort of my own home. 

And right now there's a big push in this industry - especially by the huge publisher I'm working with right now who is SUPER awesome - to work in-house. 

And honestly I don't really want to move back to the states. 

The other option is to source my own products and start my own online business.... which I *COULD* and I actually know how to do since I'm a copywriter and marketer.... but honestly I don't want to deal with the logistics. 

I don't want to hire and train assistants, deal with ad networks (like Facebook, Google, Tabloo, Revcontent, Outbrain, and Gemini), don't want to deal with customers, payment processing, shipping and handling (if I choose to do a physical product), and all that mess. 

To me trading would be the perfect solution and it would get rid of the need to have clients (or customers). 

And again - I'd be doing all the normal research I'd usually do to write a campaign, but wouldn't actually have to do the writing (which is my least favorite part even though I'm good at it). I love doing research though. ",2018-03-01

They are then hit with the same realism that the market brings.  Trading is 25% skill, 25% experience and 50% mental.  Your emotions, the fear of losing, will cloud your judgement.

Never lose your passion for trading but start off the smart way.  Use trading simulators for the first 6 months.  Completely avoid the penny stocks you mentioned as though are driven by emotions (Mostly new traders play in that realm.).  Find a mentor.  You can do well by trading more ""expensive"" stocks that have price swings.  There are plenty of mid-large cap stocks that provide enough volatility to trade and make money.  These same stocks are in uptrends so if you get your entry wrong the trend can save you over time.

The fact that penny stocks are driven by emotions is exactly why I want to trade them and why I am concentrating on them instead of other strategies. 

I have made my career as a direct response copywriter over the last eight years understanding emotions, why people buy things, and how to manipulate those emotions into.

And over the last two years I have worked with some of the world's most popular financial advisories. You know - the exact ones these same stupid penny stock traders flock to for ""hot picks"" because they can't use their brain. 

And I use fear and greed to sell them those subscriptions. 

I mean I've spent over 40 hours researching penny stocks in just the last week and the reason it seems so predictable is BECAUSE of the fear and greed displayed by clueless traders of penny stocks going off ""hot picks"" and horseshit over-sensationalized news stories and promotions. 

That's *why* I want to trade them - because I already have a knowledge set in this. 

But I also thought that's why anybody in this subreddit would want to trade them - that's the point.

I don't understand what's happening right now. I did not post a trading strategy here as advice for people to be ""skeptical"" about. I posted it as something I literally just learned and have never used and asked if it lined up with anybody's strategies and was looking for geberal advice. 

I have *zero* experience how the fuck am I supposed to sell you something unless you're interested in learning about Direct Response Copywriting... then I can give a list of exactly 12 books (most of which are 100 years old) and say good luck.

And I have CONTINUALLY asked for people to help and all I get is cynical shit.

Seems like you only got like 1 maybe 2 cynical people (expected anywhere on reddit), everyone else was pretty supportive. You seemed kinda sensitive but regardless:

I do the exact same thing (barely need to work anymore as I've had so much success trading and routinely doing so) and I respect you for thinking about this approach and also trying to educate yourself the right way.

I would recommend three things. 

One is patience, this one is obvious. 

Two is follow trends, research/news, and if you are educated, do a little bit of technical analysis. Although concepts like underlying trends, future news, volume, market cap, float, etc. are generally going to be more important. See what goes up where and how to read a chart to see what the stock has done in the past. Instinct also helps you a ton here, being able to read the sector and hell, sometimes even the garbage pump forums as they have helpful information SOMETIMES. 

Thirdly, this might actually be the most important and I fucked up a ton with this one, is FOCUS. By focus I mean focus all of your assets on a handful of stocks. I literally would never go over 4, especially with your capital. NEVER invest in more, you're killing your potential gains and sub-optimally increasing your risk. If anyone has any advice on the accuracy of these tips, go ahead and post em. 

Good luck buddy and welcome, we definitely need more chill people on these boards.

I went from $500-&gt;$3500 (august-&gt;december). I say that Tim teaches a very basic, very conservative (for pennystocks) style and isn't a bad start with the caveat that you may lose all  your money. After 3 months, I felt I was finally starting to get parts of the system (never did shorting, although the few shorts I paper shorted did well. could never find the borrows on my tiny accounts on td or etrade that made it worthwhile). 

I just couldn't handle the stress from momentum trading (which is where I found myself on early morning and later afternoon spikes) and found it triggered my gambling issues. I've since moved to long term speculation/holds in the cryptospace. Same mentality: it's all a scam, and I could lose everything, but I don't constantly day trade anymore.

He has built these accounts up to six figures every single year. I'm talking $200,000 to $400,000.

Then he wipes them clean for the next year just to help students learn. All trades are also recorded on video and posted.

He has several millionaire students. Tim Grittani made over $2 million in about three years starting with just $1,500. I'm watching his ""trading tickers"" training that he made in 2015 and following his trades I see that me made $1 million just over the holidays.

Not only that all DVD sales go to charity, so he doesn't make any no at from those.

I understand has run ing a business, but has the most transparent trader I've ever seen so far.

And he says over and over ""I'm a better teacher than I am a trader.""

Do I don't really see any evidence that his method is outdated.

I also don't see any evidence that patterns in this area (penny stocks) are somehow different than they ever were before.

Most of these rules seem pretty timeless and common sense to me (only trade liquid penny stocks, understand they're all pretty much garbage, cut losses quickly, only concentrate on the biggest percent gainers....etc).",2018-03-01

As far as taxes - I don't know. I know thay by living abroad most of the year i get a ton of tax breaks (I'm in the middle of doing taxes now, but I usually have somebody handle that because all that shit is too complicated for me).

I also look for mid caps ($20-$100 stocks ) gapping down for ""gap down and fade"" plays around the open to short. 

I also integrate my scanners to look for reversals , usually the occur a little later in the day (10:30am-11:30am) . I prefer bottom bounces on stocks between $20-$100 with at least 5 consecutive red 5 min candies .

I never trade after 11:30am

I use the Warrior Trading chat room, it's about $50 per month. 

I also use TradeZero broker , as they don't enforce the PDT rule (you can trade as much as you want with less than 25k account) and they offer free commissions when adding liquidity (getting in on the bid or out on the ask when going long for example ).

Another method recommended is to just get two brokers (or three) to get around the PDT rule. Interactive Brokers and Etrade were both recommended to start.

And I saw you eat a hot dog last week you pathetic mouth breather!""

But in your case, starting off with ""sometimes you can see it coming from SSSOOOOOO far away"" followed by constant unfounded cynicism and criticisms, none of which were constructive and all of which were devoid of value.... personally calling you our on your horseshit cannot possibly be considered an ad hominem at that point.

Attacking someone personally after they have attacked you personally does not define that.

221,NomadBao,dviqsna,/r/pennystocks/comments/814k1m/just_finished_tim_sykes_how_to_make_millions_does/dviqsna/,1,"wow. i've been trading ""pennystocks/smallcaps"" for several years.. have never looked at reddit before until now. but there seems to be a lot of negativity in people's comments. Hard to tell if it's done with good intention, or if they're just jaded cynics, or just trolls.

Overall, I hate when people just say, ""give up and stick to your dayjob"". Most annoying response and ""advice""' ever. For one, it's not advice, and two, it's absolutely not helpful. We were all beginners at once. All need to start somewhere.

Personally, I quit my job a year ago and have been trading fulltime ever since. Best decision i ever made. Been travelling the world and trading from hotels/airbnbs. Time difference is annoying, but small downside to the freedom I get. Plus, worst case scenario? Oh no, lose all my money... and go back to work... doing exactly what I was already doing... oh no, so scary. Don't get why people freak out so much about life and money.

As for your strategy, i'll tell you this:

I use a strategy that strictly preys on this ""ELIF"" strategy that you've described. If you're buying a ""breakout"", i'm most likely going to be the guy on the other side of your trade shorting it.

Going long on multiple timeframe breakouts is definitely a valid strategy, but there are several caveats. The ""time of year"" matters. If you were to try this during February, you would have gotten your ass handed to you. Now, it might work a little better as smallcaps are slowly coming alive again. But typically, smallcap momo comes in waves... you just gotta get a feel for it. December was massive during all the crypto craze and it bled over to smallcap land. Dies a lot during earnings season since more are focused on largecaps during that time.

A multiple timeframe breakout is also another word for HEAVY RESISTANCE. If you're buying what you think is a breakout, just know you're also buying RIGHT INTO HEAVY RESISTANCE.

Thus, it's safer to let it breakout first, let it consolidate a little bit throughout the day, then find a safe secondary entry. Most of these momo pennystocks are junk companies though, so it might just typically fade all day right back below resistance. Stocks never just go straight up. there's always a safer entry. Buying initial breakouts is typically pretty difficult as you'll have to market order to get filled, and there's a high risk of it immediately dumping right as you do that (especially intraday).

As an example, look at PIXY from 3/9/18. If you were fast enough, you could have filled an order over previous HOD at 4.56 at market open (a bit risky, since your stop loss would be 4.20... current LOD).  So about a 0.36 risk, just need to size appropriately. Anyway, would have paid out massively. HOWEVER, if you traded late in the day, bought the multiple time frame breakout over 6.18... you would have got immediately dumped on...  both of these are aggressive longs where you need to be quite quick. The safest long would have been mid-day at are 1:00 pm. where it had time to come back in, consolidate, prove that it wasn't breaking below $5.00 and popping back up over VWAP, with a target towards HOD. Easy to explain in hindsight, but the trick is to save 1000s of these charts and review them, as these patterns do repeat themselves.
