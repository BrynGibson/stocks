The news is great and the company does have a lot to offer. They also have an issue with compliance and if the stock price does not go up and/or an extention gets granted we could be looking at a potential r/s and the offering of 5mil of shares seems like something that happens prior to anticipation of r/s. RVOL has been high so alot of eyes are on this stock. What i cant figure out is if the volume is speculative or dilutive. If your not in already i would say its one for the watchlist. I feel i jumped the gun on this one. If it does run like it should you will have plenty of gains to take on the ride up. Dont fomo into the red like i did. Im 50/50 on my position. A gamble for sure.
