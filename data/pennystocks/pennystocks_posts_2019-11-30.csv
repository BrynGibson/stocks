2,SEARCHING FOR PROFITABLE PENNY STOCK TRADERS!,e45qas,certifiedtyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e45qas/searching_for_profitable_penny_stock_traders/,1,54,"Searching for profitable traders!

Iâ€™ve been trading for quiet sometime now (almost 2 years) Iâ€™ve read around 40 books about trading, I even have a Five Star (180 pages) notebook full of notes all based on fundamental, technicals and candle/chart patterns. I would considered myself getting used to market sentiments and as of right now Iâ€™m breaking even or having small profits whether itâ€™s investing or day trading. I do think I have developed a profitable scanner thanks to my brother (a stem student) and I feel like Iâ€™m close of getting the hang of all these stock market concepts. Although, Iâ€™m looking to expand my mind I personally feel like I have hit a plateau and I would like to learn more cause thereâ€™s always room for improvement. You can technically say Iâ€™m looking for connections but if none can provide some, I would be more than happy to attend webinars, seminars, conventions, forums. meetings, etc. but be advise that I will never buy a course just to be clear.  All help is great help! Thank you for reading and helping out ya boy.
