4,"Thoughts on the relatively new gaming convention $EGLX, just graduated to the TSX",eg4byx,AdamCaveRoberts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eg4byx/thoughts_on_the_relatively_new_gaming_convention/,1,4,"I am from Toronto and have attended the convention. I can tell you first hand, I haven't experienced a convention that combines ESports, game developers (alot of care for indies), and fan-made stuff more than this. It's more than just 'Fan Expo"" or Comic Con. 

It's a weird little thing that is growing steadily and fast. I have a position at 2.20 with $500 but I can see this being the new type of ""Con"" in the future as they expand through Canada and hopefully to the US. 

Thoughts?

This is my quarterly'ish FlexShopper post to my fellow Redditors. 

Any who invested when I last posted here are up over 100%. 

I am not here to pump, I encourage the DD and say let the numbers speak for themselves. 

I believe this company will continue to rise to fair value northward of $4 in the short-term (3-6 months). 

I have been invested long since $.73.
