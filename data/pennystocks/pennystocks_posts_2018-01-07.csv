7,A case for PNTV,7osm81,Talonx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7osm81/a_case_for_pntv/,14,1,"PNTV is an interesting stock right now.  

&gt;stock decreased 6.59% or $0.008 during the last trading session, reaching $0.112. About 6.69 million shares traded or 282.87% up from the average. Player's Network, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PNTV) has 0.00% since January 3, 2017 and is . It has underperformed by 16.70% the S&amp;P500.

Often times I like stocks that are considered ""under performing.""  Sometimes this means that they are under valued and waiting to pop. There are many reasons for a stock to under perform. I'm not going to get into that right now though. 

Now for the good.  

&gt;Player's Network, Inc. , a diversified holding company, operates in the marijuana and media markets. The company has market cap of $64.51 million. PNTV owns approximately 85% of Green Leaf Farms Holdings, LLC (Green Leaf Farms), which has Nevada state-issued medical and recreational cultivation and production licenses.

So let's take a look at volume to price point breakdown.

Highest volume in three months while sitting next to a 52 week support pattern.  

I like it.  I don't love it, but I do like it.  We will see how politics plays out in this whole federal vs state debate as it will determine a lot of price points for weed related stocks.

8,Question about Mad Catz,7otndf,SlytherinCZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7otndf/question_about_mad_catz/,8,12,"So, who they are and why I'm even posting this.
Company making gaming peripherals.
They got de-listed from NYSE and later that month filed bankruptcy, around March 2017.
Recently there was a relatively big talk about their comeback after being bought/invested in by some Chinese folks. They are supposed to operate under new management, with new road plan and overall different philosophy of the brand.

They are even anouncing new product line at CES2018.

My question is: Does this mean that they are still traded under OTCMKTS: MCZAF? I can't seem to find any info that would confirm this.

Also, would you guys consider this a buy scenario? They are currently in triple zeros.
