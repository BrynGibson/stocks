ANY appears to be a bull flag with a momentum ticking hot pot ready for a full-blown breakout. This chart is unique; like an outside bar, but instead, this is more or less a positive ascending triangle, and I personally like it. That sexy 1.15 is all it needs for a breakout to happen with a support line of 1.01.

ANY engages in the software development sector primarily for virtual applications, cloud, global network resellers. 

Industry Software is up by +2.06 &amp; software &amp; IT services up by +1.20

1) Both are located in Redmond, Washington so ideally it would be easier to work together and merge employees with one another. PLUS Microsoft has hired employees from micro vision in the past
2) Microsoft just landed a HUGE contract with the army to provide hollolens to them.
3) Microsoft has been a long time customer of Microvision for their hollolens 
4) Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox assistant ‚Äúproject Osiris‚Äù touted in the trailer that it has a state of the art built in projector with wall detection capabilities. Leveraging Microvisions state of the art projector technology.
5) Might want to fact check me on this one but I believe that Apple is using one of Microvisions patents. What better way of sticking it to Apple by having Apple Pay Microsoft through the use of their potentially bought microvision sensors.
6) Xbox could finally maybe revive the Kinect and make it as great as it was supposed to be in the future with this technology. 

Feel free to add on but I feel like not many people are looking at the potential benefits Microsoft could get if they purchased it. Does this only make sense in my head or am I going crazy?",2020-05-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gdrkbf/msft_buying_mvis_would_make_sense/

The S&amp;P 500 was +12.03 (.42%) and the Russell +3.49 (.28%) and the DJ Transports was the big loser -163.90 (2.01%).  Market internals were mixed with the NYSE 15:13 down while NAZ was 17:15 Up.  Volume was on the light side.  The DJIA was 17 down and 13 higher.  There were no major gainers or losers.

SECTORS: Earnings played a part in today‚Äôs market.  J Crew and HTZ are talking about bankruptcy, but neither traded in after hours.  SBUX didn‚Äôt actually report but did say that they were opening 98% of their China shops and those in the U.S. as soon as possible.  After closing $71.89 -1.90 it moved slightly higher to 73.60 1.71.  AIG reported but the stock did nothing while Shake Shack: SHAK missed on revenues but beat on earnings and after closing $52.77 +1.07 moved slightly higher to $55.42 it finished $53.50 + just .73.  The last name on the list was the biggest winner, Chegg: CHGG closed $43.79 +1.43 (3.38%) beat on both top and bottom lines and gave great guidance.

METALS, GOLD: $1,713.30 +12.40. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday, I was a buyer.  Our calls fell back to .75.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8935 +95. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today‚Äôs action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.98 +.51 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Got in MVIS today at 1.00 after wanting to get in at open but feeling like I missed most of the action. Apparently not. However, is IZEA on anyone else's radar?

Opened at .21. Got to .47 and closed at .35. Its hovering AH at .38 but the intriguing part is that its average volume about 1 mill. Its almost 80 mill now. 

Small company with an interesting ""social intelligence"" product that seems like its ripe to be pilfered by a bigger company; perhaps one that rhymes Boogle. 

What does it mean to you all if its only where its at now with that type of increase in volume? 

They announced an event called ""BrandGraph"", a COVID competitive intelligence streaming event. I'm still working out what that means exactly but sounds like a way to organize and share vast amounts of data points like articles, info on vaccine and treatment progress, etc. all in one place. Basically, their platform helps pair content creators with brands and publishers and they're using all the COVID info out there in the world to demonstrate the power of the technology they have. This news was announcwd today and was reason for spike. But, it settled well above today's open of .21.

I have not been honing my skills for very long, but I'm feeling a short term investment coming up soon- possibly holding until May 14th. 

From what I understand, Brandgraph is a technology that can analyze millions of social media influencers to gauge consumer activity. It is, ""...designed to help marketers navigate the landscape created by COVID-19.""

The stock has already seen upward movement today with a low of .31 and a high of .48. It is sitting on .38 right now. Maybe it's too soon to tell, but I wanted to see what you guys thought of this. Brandgraph raises eyebrows. If it is a good product, then marketing data would be invaluable to companies who are struggling to find a niche during the pandemic.

I haven't been investing in stocks very long, but I have learned a great deal from you all these past few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Their main market is social media influencers, which is especially good because of our current world pandemic.  

&amp;#x200B;

They just made a partnership with twitch to do 'live sponsorships', and if there is one thing gamers love to do, it's throw their money at stuff, especially on twitch.  

&amp;#x200B;

They've got some big name companies behind them, Wendy's, NBC, Kraft. 

They have consistently met their quarterly earnings, with the exception of Q4 back in december, just BARELY missing out.  

&amp;#x200B;

Their volume is through the roof right now, AVG Vol. 10.8M, current Vol. 79.3M.

‚ÄúWebb Diagnostic Technologies says test can detect COVID-19 with up to 99 percent accuracy in one minute‚Äù

‚ÄúThe test is designed as a ‚Äútotal antibody test,‚Äù meaning it can detect all human immunoglobulins present in a patient‚Äôs blood if they are infected with COVID-19. As opposed to current tests on the market, which detect the presence of only a few. The broader view at human antibodies allows for a much higher success rate in detecting the virus, a task the Webb test can do in a much shorter amount of time, according to Jones.‚Äù

I got an email from RH yesterday saying, we are sorry to see you go, blah blah blah, your transfer will be complete in 5-7 days. In the meantime, ALL TRADES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. Of course this happened after buying into MVIS more. So now, I watch it climb, knowing I will not be able to sell before the call on Thursday, knowing that 99% likely it is going to tank Friday morning, if not sooner.

What are everyone's plans for the next up and coming that we can get into after this has paid out for us.  A friend of mine went back to work for the first time yesterday and had to go through a thermal camera to show no fever.  Maybe MARK is the play here?  Its recently spiked.

it has a very clear exit date for all of us already scheduled of Mon May 18th @ 2:00 pm EST.  I'm kind of a fan knowing in advance like this when the spike should happen.  Maybe worth following the other posts I've seen about this?

I've been in XSPA for awhile and made some decent profit.  I was waiting on airports to have more foot traffic and sell then but I'm becoming impatient with the cash just sitting.

GNBT:

Small biotech company developing and manufacturing samples of possible CV vaccine (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generex-biotechnology-initiates-peptide-manufacturing-123010024.html); probably starting clinical trials in the near future if funding is gained. they're using a patented system activation mechanism that is already patented to them to make the vaccine (see https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-26831283/documents/5e73891471930g8BqVxh/Ii-Key-nCOV%20Peptide%20Vaccine.Overview.3%2019%2020.pdf if you want to see more about it).

Financials don't look too bad for a company of its stature: moderate debt doesn't pose a lot of risks to future goals as of right now.

Main thing to focus on with this company is its potential in the vaccine market. it poses a lot of possible profit and large growth if it is able to get funding and go through CV trials. In the past week it's also shown positive results for vaccines aiming to reduce the recurrence of breast cancer (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/generex-subsidiary-nugenerex-immuno-oncology-132432839.html). HUGE chance of GNBT securing funding to continue these projects.

Largest takeaways from CV vaccine article:

""-Submitted proposal to BARDA for start-to-finish funding to develop an approved, commercial Ii-Key peptide vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus""


""[CEO] Moscato continued, ‚ÄúIn addition to our efforts to develop Ii-Key peptide vaccines for oncology, the Generex management team is actively involved in a COVID-19 emergency response effort. We are advancing discussions with BARDA and have been working hard to assemble an impressive group of partner organizations to implement an accelerated, multifaceted development program to commercialize our Ii-Key-SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine in response to the U.S. government calls for a vaccine solution to the coronavirus crisis. We are working to secure manufacturing, laboratory, clinical, regulatory, and expert medical advisory services with world-class organizations like PPD, Polypeptide Labs, Bachem, Ajinomoto, Thermo-Fisher, CTL Laboratories, and San Diego Center for AIDS Research as well as renowned clinical research sites at Tufts University Medical Center and Wake Forest Baptist Health. Together we have prepared a full proposal for the end-to-end development of an Ii-Key-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Additionally, we continue discussions with Canadian health authorities, having held a pre-CTA teleconference last week, and we plan to finalize our regulatory strategy in collaboration with Health Canada in the coming weeks.""",2020-05-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ge12mb/gnbt_gem_amidst_mvis/

Wanted to come in and share some research and DD I‚Äôve been doing for IZEA. With earnings coming up on 5/14 and a few major announcements recently, IZEA is ripe for a big run up to and beyond earnings call, more on this shortly.

For those unaware, IZEA is a large marketing firm based in FL. Working with brands and entertainers to connect and run ad campaigns.

IZEA announced recently the acquisition of Twitch as an approved platform to add to their marketing software, allowing brands a wider audience to push their goods/services to. Opening themselves up for a larger share of client budgets for both existing and potential clients. Big win.

They also announced yesterday the major success and milestone of their BrandGraph system has surpassed 500 million pieces of content analyzed and indexed to better their position with marketers. With the announcement, and to presumably flex their muscle a bit, they‚Äôve announced an event on 5/18 for brands to gain a ton of more info and leverage the ongoing pandemic in their marketing campaigns. Another really big win.

IZEA already had a good run up yesterday 5/4 and it‚Äôs pulled back a bit today, though earnings are expecting to be smashed on 5/14 with news of exactly how well BrandGraph has been performing. And with the event scheduled so soon after earnings share price is expected to run up. 

I‚Äôve seen speculation of it topping over $1.25 with the good news, though can‚Äôt find a reliable analyst source confirming this. I‚Äôm going in today, depending on if funds clear into the account today will determine how large of a position I take. 

Best of luck to everyone out there!",2020-05-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ge03jv/izea_bull_run_on_upcoming_earnings_beat/

Pre-Covid pricing was about $1.15. 52 week high was +$3.00, which dropped due to ingredient sourcing issues.Earnings call is May 11th.My take is that people like drinking ginger ale when they are feeling ill as a holistic remedy, and we are in the midst of a pandemic.

If the supply chain issues are resolved this could return to $3.00.

This hasn't been much of a rocket like other stocks posted in the sub, more of a space elevator.

This was likely an INTENTIONAL scare tactic to shock smaller buyers. It caused many stop losses to trigger which snowballed things.

Why would a seller do such a thing?

Simple.

1. The Whale sells 700k shares
2. Stop losses are triggered making things worse
3. Other buyers panic and sell (possibly even for losses)
4. When the time is right and it's low enough, the whale buys back in chunks so the price doesn't sky again.

5. Profit for the whale.

Basically some person with 700k shares just punked a lot of investors into selling in one way or another so they could buy back cheaper.  There was no news. There was no reason for this drop.  Just investors trying to get the stock cheaper in later hours or after hours trading.

I didn't know this was possible, but now it's not looking like it's going to go near that price point.

Any tips or guidance on what I should do? I'm fine with breaking even and never investing again until I have more knowledge, but I definitely fucked up. It's not a lot of money, but I'm -170$ right now.

But they have some key differences which changes how we should view them, imo:

1. MVIS is actually a legit company.
2. MVIS has 10 times the market cap.
3. MVIS actually has some innovative technology. I remembered reading up on them 6 months ago and thought about buying in. The consensus was that they have some technology for the future. I can't find the source, and I'm not going to bother finding it. But just saying MVIS isn't some bs company with nothing to offer.
   1. I believe I was looking for some augmentative reality and 3D sensing stocks at the time. I basically passed on MVIS because it was a penny stock, and I was told that you should never invest in penny stocks. So if this stock caught my eye 6 months ago, I wouldn't be surprised if they are being eyed for a buyout by another company. It probably won't be Micorosft. That's too good to be true. But who knows who. Point is, that they are appealing.

This is what has made me the most.,ge92ks,sra-uomi,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ge92ks/buy_the_hypesell_before_prcallsearnings_this_is/,8,49,"I've lost thousands on penny stocks before, specifically around this time last year. I took a long hiatus from even touching anything until I educated myself with the basics and while I did so I sat on the sidelines and watched others. 

There is one common theme, it's constant with Penny Stocks. 

Buy the Hype, and SELL at a profit if possible. 

I sold at 1.00 for 200 MVIS today when I originally bought in at .41 and made $118. 

I could have held until it was in the 1.50+ range but I didn't. I was comfortable with what my return was and blew MVIS off for most of the day and found RTTR and watched TTI. 

Some of you played SCON &amp; NAK which I missed out but you know what,

There's always going to be an MVIS or SCON or NAK.

 There is always going to be a P&amp;D to take advantage of. 

I have RTTR &amp; TTI and I don't care about what they do long term, all I care about is my return on that investment in the short-term because Penny Stocks offer NO security for long term gains. 

Next week or tomorrow or next month there will be another RTTR, TTI and MVIS. 

I've made $300+ Thursday , $150&lt; Friday, $150&gt; Monday and $100&gt; today. 

No losses, just a strict return. Just profit, I see green and a number I'm comfortable with and I bow out. 

I will absolutely tell you all I am not professional, nowhere God damn nowhere near a professional but I'm trying to educate myself along the way and have taken up paper trading. 

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing besides following trends and accepting a win when I've been given a win. 

I just do this shit for fun and I play the game. 

I'm not WSB fucking with options because that's how you lose your ass and if you don't know what you're doing and especially with Penny Stocks, you will lose. 

I am not trying to be rude or anything I just know there are a lot of new people and they're excited with the gains they've made and they should be excited. Just don't fall for the BS with every other person saying ""THIS IS IT üöÄüöÄüöÄ BUY ""XYZ"" NOW"". 

I'm getting more into doing my own research and sure DD from others CAN mean a BIG WIN for you but MOST of the time, that will not be the case, don't trust me. Trust the experienced investors that I'm sure will back me up when I say there's no better DD than the DD you do yourself. 

Make your own decisions and if something runs and is running, decide if it makes sense for you to jump into something that's already seen an increase, and accept the possibility that you may lose but don't chase if it's mid-day/power hour. If it's already peaked and you think it might again...highly unlikely. I've seen one user post about buying in @ UAV for 4+ and excuse me what I bought in at 1.21 and was leaning on bowing out at $3.50 but set a stop loss and a limit sell for 4.00 and got lucky. Even if it peaked at 2.00 I would have grabbed my profit and ran but that run was INSANE. 

MVIS is running until Thursday and I bought back in @1.06, with profits I made since yesterday ($150 or so) and already I see major return which I definitely intend to cash in on as soon as market opens. 


I'm just ranting at this point but I hope this helps some of you see the reality of Penny Stocks. I know some of you remember PRPO (Precipio). We all saw what happened there, and a lot of you saw what happened with UAVS and DECN and I guarantee, the same thing will happen with MVIS. 



I just care about you guys, this is a great community and we are all here to win, right? If that's the case then we need to be realistic with what we are promoting and know when to take a win and move on. 

I really won't be upset if I get shit on or told off because I know how abrasive people can be.


Someone said earlier ""if you show off your big dick long enough you'll get two in the ass"".

I laughed my ass off because it's the truth. 

My last word of ranting/rambling/advice. 

Set a fucking Stop Loss, guys.

I've been lurking this sub since I made this account, as well as WallStreetBets and Options, and only recently (Feb-ish) started contributing.

I've seen the userbase of this and WSB skyrocket recently with this pandemic market SNAFU.

I'm worried WSB attitudes are going to start flowing over into this subreddit. 

I enjoy the arrogance and comedy and camaraderie associated with the losses and gains there, but it belongs... There.

I've already seen comments that are akin to the general tone of wsb (such as slang used almost exclusively there, endearing or not).

Others have seen the general ""I can't read,"" ""no idea what I'm looking at,"" meanwhile absolutely burying the technical analysis that was the point of the post.

There has also been an immense increase in spam; duplicated posts, posts with half a sentence all in caps TRUST ME, BUY THIS OMG with no analysis or DD.
