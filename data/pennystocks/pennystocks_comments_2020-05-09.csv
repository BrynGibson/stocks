It's okay if you use someone else as a starting point for a stock which might look interesting. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. The approach is to actually do some research and ask yourself a few things:

* How much am I investing into this? 5% of my account? 10%? More? Assessing the risk with an objective mindset is more beneficial to understand the position you want to set up for yourself. You should couple this in with your estimated reward range and decide if it's worth it.
* Why this stock? Does it have a lot of hype right now? Why? Will it die down quick, or is there actual substance behind it like upcoming products? Be wary of websites like Seeking Alpha or Motley Fool. You should be the final arbiter of what to do.
* How long to hold? Day trade? Hm, earnings are coming up and it's cheap right now. Do they look strong on their balance sheet? Make an exit plan.
* Read, read, read. Then read some more. News about the markets, sectors, competitors. Listen to professional traders and conferences. Maybe even youtubers who do this for a living. They too were once regular inexperienced people like you and me.

Here is how. MMs are required to provide liquidity regardless. So there are algos that will attempt to match orders no matter what.

If you were at the market (not retail, not through a broker), in a situations with very low volume you could sell back and forth a small position to yourself essentially to drive the price up. This will work until another trader shows up to make a trade. This works because the MMs algos don't have to do anything as you are providing liquidity.

So over seconds, minutes, maybe 10s of minutes you can push the stock up (or down if you wanted) in this way.

The ones I'm keeping an eye on:

$NBY I have a limit order placed pretty highly, there's some spec this might fly between tomorrow and Friday

Covid-19:15 Second Home Testing GenViro! Swift Kit Identified By Largest CBS Affiliate In The Country As Potential Testing Solution To Help Get Country Back To Work
05/12/2020, 9:10 PM
WCBS-TV REPORT BY CHIEF HEALTH AND MEDICAL REPORTER DR. MAX GOMEZ, ALSO PICKED UP ON YAHOO NEWS, THEREBY REACHING A TOTAL AUDIENCE OF OVER 13 MILLION
LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 12, 2020 / Decision Diagnostics Corp. (OTC PINK:DECN) through its subsidiary Pharma Tech Solutions, Inc. the manufacturers and design specifiers for the GenViro! Covid-19 :15 test professional Swift Kit, today announced that it received detailed media coverage for its individual home testing version of the Swift Kit. Decision Diagnostics is an 18-year old, diabetes and now infectious disease testing bio-technology development firm, high-level manufacturer, quality plan administrator, FDA registered medical device customer support organization, and exclusive worldwide sales and regulatory process agent for its own proprietary regulated medical devices. 

""Recognition from leading health and medical media is exactly what we want to more quickly build momentum toward testing that will be critical in helping the country get back to work,"" said CEO Keith Berman. ""While we continue to wait for the FDA to APPROVE last issue in our testing protocol, even as we have begun the testing, it is important the public know through respected, independent third-parties in the media that true assistance in combatting the virus that has virtually paralyzed our country is being sought as quickly as possible TO answer the needs of individuals and businesses alike.""

It is in the news, they have a lobbyist reaching out to the US government regularly, there are Fortune 500 companies lining up with interest to buy it, FEMA is interesting and a host of other companies. It is getting too big for you to deny and will be taking off without you like a missed flight. You'll still be on the ground saying the engines don't work.

If there was anything scam-related, the SEC and DTTC would not have restored the stock. They restored it through no choice because they COULDN'T find anything wrong with it.",2020-05-09

If you call and ask you will understand that decn has submitted there protocol, or you might say, there testing procedure, on how they will test there genviro kit.

There's a guy named Franz that goes around doing something similar. He's on every board that I have seen. Yet supposedly 'sold' his stock a long time ago, which brought everyone to ask: ""What is he still doing here??""  I can take a peek at the Yahoo Finance message board and literally tell that some people are either part of competitor companies, butthurt that they sold their stock previously (if they even ever had any) and are dead set on bashing that one stock. When that happens, something is wrong. 

There have been hackers trying to slow the company down, an abnormally large sale targeted to drop the company's price down (also likely a competitor), several people (who are known to the company - future charges are likely coming because they have stated that they know who they are) filing falsified reports to the SEC, etc. There's too much going on for it to be a 'fake' stock. People are trying too hard to hold it down.

Then there's also the issue of 100,000 kits being able to be SHIPPED the day after FDA approval. You can't ship what you don't have. You can't have a product if you claim it can't exist. So when they get approval and ship 100,000 kits next day, you're going to be caught with your parents down. Probably 10 accounts per day are banned from Yahoo Finance because I've had them take a look at their post histories and see that they are obvious paid or a competitor trying to bash the stock. They could see it plain as day.",2020-05-09

What part of IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION do you not fully understand? Because everyone else has known that for a couple of months now. You've either lost a lot of money by selling early on or you work for a competitor, it's that simple. If as you say, you've previously submitted a complaint to the SEC and they HAVE FOUND NOTHING so far, you may have some jail time coming up buddy. You (among a number of other people) submitted a falsified complaint to a governing body that suspended a stock and found NOTHING wrong with it. DTTC restored that stock last week. You're a scammer. I hope DECN presses full charges against the ""complainers"" who have no basis and takes action. May you get some prison time for your false complaint that resulted in others losing money simply based on your opinion. Every one of you fakers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and put in prison for your crimes. That just might be coming up soon because the company has pushed back for a reason and challenged the suspension. Nothing was wrong and it was restored. Attention will be turned on those crying wolf and it will come right back down on their heads for falsifying everything. Make a false complaint to the police and you go to jail.

Rest assured, they will likely seek charges against all of them. Your name may be on their radar right now. Sucks for you. Shouldn't have filed a false complaint out of your own pity party.

They have been dragged through the mud. If DECN was a con they wouldn‚Äôt have applied for the approval, and fda procedures as they have done on so many of their other patents and technology. The fda is warning over 100 companies that they are in violation for not applying for EUA approval and just selling their serology tests. DECN has profits of millions of dollars per year not very big, but there are systems in place and testing where they work closely with their supplier in Korea to pull this off. I thought people would do their own DD on this company and from what I am finding out through 40 hours of research since being on the news is that DECN will get approval and they will start selling and donating their kits to help. There is a lot more out there than what I have found below to support my conclusion and I can share more if needed. He may not get approval next week, but he will get it in the next month. His time frame is to have tests ready to go before summer. 

As this Coronavirus spread, and with time on their hands during the lock down, we asked The Bio several days after their mid-February 2020 lock down, to look into whether some of our diabetic detection and management technologies could be put to use to develop a coronavirus test.
We had decided that if such a test methodology were possible it was worthwhile from a humanitarian standpoint to use our limited resources at least to try to develop such a test. A few days later we received three cites from The Bio regarding technical papers written in the last five years where the researchers and scientists discussed in those white papers the ability to use a method called impedance to identify and classify certain (now familiar) classes of virus. All three papers described their methodologies in detail and included sample data sets.
In all three cases the researchers designed and built a bench level chemistry methodology and their version of an identification device, and then performed tests on live patients. In all cases the number of patients (subjects) tested was statistically significant. The importance of these publications indicated that a testing device and chemistry method, using impedance (better described as an energy pulse with traits somewhat similar to an electric current and a radio wave pulse), could be created in short order to measure the presence or absence of such a virus (of interest) such as influenza and H1N1 influenza, and of course SARS and Covid-19. The company‚Äôs GenUltimate TBG product makes use of impedance technology to measure the number of red blood cells in a patient blood sample, information relevant to a glucose measurement in that same patient. Mr. Berman, the company‚Äôs CEO, became convinced that a similarly configured device could be built for the determination of Covid-19.
As quickly as it could the company engaged Matthew Musho, PhD (holder or collaborator in 32 patents published in parallel fields) and his wife Leslie to assist in the design of a testing method and device for the measurement of Covid-19.

https://patents.justia.com/inventor/matthew-k-musho
The company also engaged FDA practice counsel to prepare the company and its new product for submission for emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA. Counsel, already familiar with the company‚Äôs products and technologies, understood almost immediately what the company was trying to achieve and during the last week in February counsel contacted the FDA. This contact was made a day or two prior to the FDA‚Äôs eased guidance for EUA, published on February 27, 2020. A subsequent further easing of FDA past policy appeared in a March 16, 2020 guidance policy.
The specifications guidelines set down by Mr. Berman, for creating this Covid-19 testing device and its important chemistry, were that the test must be measured on the company‚Äôs existing Precise or Avantage glucometers, because they were completed products, having been tested to great length, and now to be adapted for detection of Covid-19 instead of whole blood glucose. In addition, the resulting chemistry would necessarily run using a patients (small sample of) whole blood taken from a finger prick, and later defined as 1-2 microliters (a small drop on a finger tip), and perform the test and provide a result in one minute or less (later redefined as 15 seconds or less), with at least a 95% accuracy. Mr. Berman believed this device was capable of 97-98% accuracy. Three alternative designs were provided and given to the company on March 2. Two of the designs were diagrammed by Mathew Musho, PhD, the third design by a chemist and engineer from The Bio in Korea. The chosen of the three alternative product designs would bear the trade name GenViro! Swift.
The company then set to work, along with Matthew Musho, PhD (‚ÄúMusho‚Äù), to evaluate the designs, keeping in mind the desired specifications of the DECN CEO and product Program Director, which included availability of components without wait time, time to market (assuming FDA EUA), whether the chosen method was applicable to use in point of care and at-home environments, time of assay from commencement of test and until result, size of the blood sample, and finally cost to produce. Given the company‚Äôs experience in working with biosensors and with electrode technology, the design review process took less time than originally expected. The entire process took 13 days. The last of these days used to determine which of the two Musho specifications was to be chosen. The design provided by The Bio was discarded because it could not be read on the existing company meter technology, and therefore would require additional development. At the end of this process, the company chose to produce the product shown in the illustrations, the second of the two Musho alternative versions, but shortly thereafter to begin work on the other Musho specification, to be used as a confirmation tool.
Product Design 1 (chosen)
The design above is in many regards similar to the direct antibody antigen approaches favored by some of the competitive companies in the Covid-19 testing field. But the major difference (magic) is that the approach used by the company in its GenViro! product allows for swift (15 seconds or less) results using a minimum of blood from a finger prick. As of this writing, work has commenced on the product specification above with components such as the platinum electrodes, platinum carbon paste, industrial films (several types) to make the biosensor, and perhaps a new impedance chip for the meter. The company is operating on an 8-week development schedule and is some 10 days into this schedule. The current development cycle is considered advanced development. For FDA EUA filing and the granting of a Pre-EUA by the FDA, the company is preparing its final working concept filing, to be completed within days of this writing.",2020-05-09

I've read the PRs. To me they appear reasonably optimistic given the circumstances and demand of such a product. There have been more exaggerated claims made by much higher members of our society than I've read in those PRs.

I reviewed the study on electrical impedance in virus detection (granted I'm no med student). It doesn't appear to doubt the technology whatsoever. Link below. I found this simply by searching ""electrical impedance virus detection"" on google.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925400518317684

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4563260/

They have existing FDA approved glucose blood testing devices on the market today.

The company is not currently profitable and reported a net income of -5.5Mil for 2019. This is expected of a penny stock. Could it be easily made up for with the demand of Genviro and possibly lead to a profitable year if they play costs an payroll cards right?

The CEO hasn't run to Mexico with anyone's money and continues to remain optimistic about the product potential.

I don't see an army of hypers and pumpers making wild unreasonable speculations about this company on reddit like other more ""popular"" choices like UAVS, MVIS, etc..

I'm genuinely wondering if those claiming that this was a scam did so simply because of previous scams they've witnessed in the past in this realm of trading.

It just appears from the angle I currently see it that they were placed on hold along with dozens of other companies while the SEC could sort out who was scamming and who had legitimacy. This is completely understandable due to the current world and economic matters at hand.

Currently a little over 8000 shares. Bought at .12 and plan on holding until I see a reasonable alternative. I've contemplated posting my thoughts on this company here for a while but I'm generally a lurker.

I feel that unlike UAVS and MVIS (which I took no stake in) DECN hasn't had it's ""conference call"" which still allows for potential if enough interest is generated in the product. That is if normal trading is able to resume.

I really am curious to read a well thought out position against DECN to consider and appreciate anyone with experience to share.

They've historically been a poorly managed, speding out of control, company.  But they've turned a corner w new CEO and just barely escaped bankruptcy.  They still do stupid shit like postpone earnings at the last second and it's frustrating.  And so most investors are still traumatized and won't touch it w a 10 foot pole.  So that's the the bear side.

Bull side: But they have massive earnings potential, they own blackbird, the largest cannabis delivery platfrom in CA and NV.  They own Jupiter which makes vaping products in US and CA and they also own a wholesale ops in MA that's really starting to take off.  The last ER, they were at this same price and they tripled from the ER run up and the post ER enthusiasm..... then everyone profit took and covid and it plunged.  Handle with care, but this one has a pretty solid support line so very limited downside potential IMO.

680,mervinsanders,fq0rt1j,/r/pennystocks/comments/gg6jfp/fet/fq0rt1j/,1,"My problem with O&amp;G right now, is I can‚Äôt even trust the longevity of even mid-sized orgs. My money is in the bigger companies via an ETF risk dispersion, because the upside still appears to be double to recover their typical value. Note: I don‚Äôt subscribe to the ongoing commentary that O&amp;G is fading. The simple reality, every year the past 20-years, humans have used more oil year over year.

After oil plummeted, I also scanned for companies that dropped more than usual, but still have reasonable balance sheets to protect them. MRO has done surprisingly well for me (but not a penny stock... so I probably shouldn‚Äôt discuss it here).

For people looking for a penny play, BTE has been promising for a long time. To be fair, I exited this stock last week because their earnings look horrible, but that‚Äôs a function of O&amp;G Russia and Saudi Arabia flooding the market with supply... and less consumption due to COVID. I‚Äôll probably re-enter BTE at some point, perhaps if WTI goes over the mid-30s, because BTE needs 40 to break-even.

Yes, they have a new drug being released next week along with other possible bump PR. However, this was known about this week. It's not new information. If anything this stock should have gone up more on Thurs/Friday with this knowledge but it struggled.

There is also a certain investment company who bought into them at the valuation of .40 cents a share early on (when it was sitting around .32 I think). Now, this is both a good thing and a bad thing because it means confidence the stock will rise well above that .40 cent mark (which it did). However, this investment company is also known for shorting a stock to make money.

Both these things mean undoubtedly KTOV will rise, but it's going to be a very risky stock to play as it could crash at any moment or become a rollercoaster of rises and crashes. So be careful.",2020-05-09

I run a construction company and my brother is in the field while I mainly office to take care of claims work and paperwork plus at home teaching the kids as my wife is in the medical industry. I spent over 40 hours pouring through documentation on this. I was so confident I just didn‚Äôt want to over hype things. The company has been in business for a while and though they are not viable they have a decent technology and revenue stream. I couldn‚Äôt find one bad thing about this company. I am for testing to get our country back on track. I am into HOLX for a good chunk. I know one of their field employees he‚Äôs a tech in the field and flys to fix HOLX testing machines..... this is the reason why I was looking for a company to do faster tests and I learned about them on this thread. I support DECNs plan to get this testing approved. It may be a long road to approval but there is value in the owners tenacity to never give up. The crap I read on mvis blew my mind. They said in their press release they had all bad news yet the stock rose to over 1.7. DECN doesn‚Äôt have a board or a large office. They don‚Äôt have flashy marketing or even a flashy website. Read the press releases over the last 10 years. I get that those can be misleading, but this guy comes off as being a fighter and someone to get behind. Litigation with insubordinate employees, the Johnson and Johnson legal battle he won. It just doesn‚Äôt come off that this guy is a fraud. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in. 30k at .21. I will get my investment out at some point I have little doubt of that. The owner doesn‚Äôt care about us. He comes off as someone who cares about his company. If you want proof read all the press releases over the last 10 years. There is a lot of good info in there and it explains some of his debt as well. Good luck to all on this.",2020-05-09

* Why 25 consecutive wins isn't something to hold up as a standard. I've done it several times

I made good money when i used to round it daily.  There became a point where i was losing way more than i was winning. I didnt know where it was until later in life. It was when my emotions made it about the game then the money. I felt just as hyped if not more hyped when i lost then when i won. It was the emotion i was chasing. Came to a point one night i lost 3700 playing craps betting 100 chips on the field each play. I lost it all eventually mixed with alcohol and anger. 

Invest your money not your emotions. You can invest your time but not your emotion. Dont get caught with pot committment.

I dont want to come off preachy at all but i always look back at my dumbass 21 year old self and think only if someone told me this shit. Seems like alot of young traders here.

I still talk to alot of Crypto kids who it just seems like numbers and lines. Which of your friends have REALLY made their shit.

If you make $13/hr 40 hours a week. Thats 2253 a month before taxes. If you netted 100 dollars gain a day for 5 days a week for 52 weeks... thats $12.5/hr.. you doubled your salary. 

How many of you have had $100+ profit multiple days this week but didnt pull out and left red?  Now subtract what you lost from your hourly wage. 

Congrats you just gave yourself a demotion.

So mqny people work years to get to a 60k a year job? Stocks should be supplementary to your income. Remember to get an education. Fuck use your earning to get an education debt free!

1195,JGWol,fq495za,/r/pennystocks/comments/gga306/daily_discussion_may_09_2020/fq495za/,2,"Lessons learned this week:

MVIS: it‚Äôs not dangerous to jump in on hype as long as the pump hasn‚Äôt hit (and there hasn‚Äôt been a pump for several months). Also, if cost point distribution (found by Webull) shows that the majority of holders are at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù, so you know that even if the stock jumps 100%, a lot of optimistic people will hold and ensure you can do a quick daytrade. I ended up making $450.

My mistake? Jumping in on day two, thinking ‚Äúif the merger is real, I‚Äôll go rich‚Äù. Nope. Down $600, so I lost $150 when I could‚Äôve walked away with $450.

ZOMS: in at .21 with 19k shares. Saw the stock climb to .37 during AH, and was shocked to see a $3000 return. Hell, I‚Äôve only started day trading since last month. And I felt proud to be up $1200 as of that moment. When market opened and the stock dropped to .28, I held on expecting a rise. 0.32 hit and I thought ‚Äúwhy settle for $2000 when I can make $3000?‚Äù. Well, I ended the day at $500 up. Which meant, after my MVIS deficit, I was only up $350 for the week. 

If I sold when I was up, and walked away instead of trying to double dip with my winnings, I would be up $2,450 for the week. $3,600 for the month. My first month ever trading.

But, here‚Äôs the upside: I learned a lot. I‚Äôve spent the last two days doing DD on ZOMS to see if I should hold, and I have to say that I feel comfortable that it will continue to grow. My choice on this is to sell at the next rally (hopefully Monday) and move on. Sure, the stock might hit $4 in a year, but I‚Äôm already tired of chasing the moon.

Also, feeling confident about TOPS this week. I put in for 6000 shares on Friday.",2020-05-09

Gained $500 on small smart moves, then lost $500 on medium dumb moves. ‚ÄúOf course XYZ will increase in the next week, if it did, I would make more money!‚Äù  At some point I was telling myself it would definitely make money and stopped asking myself ‚Äúwhy will this stock fail?‚Äù  

When I started asking myself that question again, made a huge difference in why I would or wouldn‚Äôt put money in and also changed how much I was willing to risk. Another change was my timeline. Almost all of my losses happened in a 4-24 hour window, while my gains occurred over a weeks period or more. 

Every trader has a different strategy and different end goal. The most difficult thing any of us can probably do is find our personal strategy while not losing a lot of money. 

At least this is what I‚Äôve come to know in my two weeks of trading lol. I am no seasoned professional by any means. Just a chump wanting to earn enough in the market to cover annual house repairs lol.",2020-05-09

I set the limit almost immediately after buying- I am assuming if it hits that point that it will bust shortly after. If it doesn't and climbs even higher for whatever reason, I don't care. If it doesn't hit that limit and starts to decline, I will sell.

I'm actually experimenting with taking quick small profits so I sell 30% of my shares at 3.5% gain, then I put in a stop loss at 3% gains and a limit sell at 4% 5%, 8%, 10% etc to sell various percentages of the remaining stock and always lock in a stop loss order with every limit order reached.

This way I'm hopefully not missing opportunities to profit early and catch another falling stock to repeat.

I am now combining this with selling covered calls with a week out expiry to lock in gains in at a minimum 6-9% after the premium is taken into account.

What I figured out is that if you can average 1% growth per week, that  is 67% growth on the year, so that's my aim now.

1% will feel like nothing the first few weeks and there will be weeks you make less than 1% as well as weeks you have more than 1%, but the numbers don't lie and you will begin to grow in time.

You can do unlimited day trades if you have one because you're not trading, or allowed to trade, on margin, which is what the PDT rule is keeping people from doing so they don't go all in on some dumb stock on margin and bankrupt themselves. In a cash account they don't care how many times you day trade because it's all your money. The only difference is that you have to wait for cash to settle before trading more, and eventually you will run out of money for that day because it is all unsettled and there are laws and violations about using unsettled cash to buy securities. So say you had 1K you could split it into 10 stocks or you could day trade one stock $100 at a time. Buy low, sell high and you could attempt to make a % trade on every batch of $100 that you sell and you can get 10 day trades in.

&gt; If I was to make a solid 10% return with an initial 1,000$ investment how many trades would it take to turn that 1,000$ into 10,000$? That sounds pretty good. 10,000$.

Chill. He was just making a point. If you're shitting on him about the details of the post, you're missing the point and will probably not learn anything from it. 

Somebody also said something about how he is saying not to have emotions about trading or about a stock. He's not saying you need to become emotionless. Nobody can do that. If you can, you're a psychopath. What he is saying is to become aware of the emotions you tend to have at certain points while trading and get better at recognizing them in realt time and not falling victim to those emotions. AKA: get the hell out of the stock if its not going your way and/or get out when you feel you made roughly what you though you could make on the trade. Or set your stops to guarantee profit. 

I'm new to trading and everything but not new to recognizing when a brother is trying to help people out for free and gets criticized for doing it. For the most part, we're all trying to have each other's back and share research and that's so dope considering we're all basically strangers. But, when the vets do something to help us out, lets hear them out and be grateful. Let the broader point he was making sink in. Of course you'll be wrong on some trades. So, add a few to the number he gave. Big deal. Point is, slow and steady wins the race.

Losses will happen, this is why good management and discipline is the biggest hurdle for new investors. Stop loss use is essential in this model, and even then it's going to require careful management. One 30% loss could potentially wipe out three wins, and I don't need to explain that a position can bleed out that much support a hell of a lot faster than it can build in most cases. Pump and dumps can be profitable, but I don't think it's a great play for beginners, especially since our current market is volatile af and largely unpredictable. A lot of these ""quarantine kid"" traders are going to hemorrhage money once the market starts behaving in a more normal fashion. There's a lot of brand new traders that think they have the game figured out because volatility and general weirdness is rewarding strategies that would normally run them aground- i.e. long holds on 2x and 3x etf's, bio pharma, pennies, etc...

I'm sitting tight on 100k shares. I still have faith. If it goes, I owe you a steak dinner or something. Frederick Jones is also now on the board of a company in Alberta called Bluewater Acquisitions. Not sure if that's coincidence or it will somehow tie to Delfin.

Edit: whoops, this post is almost a month old, I didn't look at the post before providing info that is already stated. Sorry.",2020-05-09

I still think they‚Äôre way over valued, but it‚Äôs an easy stop loss for those who held on.",2020-05-09
