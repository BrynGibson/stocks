SEATTLE, Aug. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NetworkWire – SinglePoint Inc. (OTC:SING) provides overall company update including revenue, Form 10, acquisitions. SinglePoint over the past year has been able to successfully integrate its acquisitions and reported revenues of over $188,000 for the first quarter of 2018, which represents a significant increase as compared to the first quarter of 2017.  This revenue increase has been generated by successful acquisitions continuing to grow and operate, including DIGS and JAG. Acquisitions have been a key factor in starting to build a solid financial base and we intend to continue to grow the company. We hope that our growth will continue both organically and with larger investments and or acquisitions which can further solidify our financial position.  


“We built a solid base throughout 2017 and have been building upon that in 2018 which has led to SinglePoint starting to generate a major increase in revenue compared to previous years. We are looking to acquire companies that are cash flow positive. This will give SinglePoint the ability to operate and continue taking risks in hyper growth opportunities”, states Greg Lambrecht CEO.

We believe that our recently filed Form 10-12G with the SEC will provide more transparency and credibility which will open doors to future growth. SinglePoint is hopeful that with these new opportunities the company can continue to build shareholder value and long-term appreciation, through marketing and sales of current suite of services as well as acquisitions.
