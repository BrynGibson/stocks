Yes, we might be headed into a real bear market, but ideally, you don't just want to be shorting without any reasoning behind it. My rule is that I buy puts on companies that are headed to zero anyways, like $ACB (sorry if this triggers you potheads) or $SEAS (I only want to be in the splash zone with Jerome Powell) or $PLAY. One such company that I've looked into, is a shitty topgolf competitor called Drive Shack ($DS).

Now, $DS already sucks big time. I know, because I've been to a Drive Shack location, and it was a surreally shitty experience. We waited forever, the food took forever (even though no one was there) and it sucked and the fucking golf didn't even work and they had to reset it it while we were playing. TopGolf was a lot of fun, $DS was absolutely shitty. I've been calling $DS and TopGolf (privately held, unfortunately) on the weekends, and the wait time at their locations is nonexistent compared to TopGolf.

To compound this, revenue has been going down, earnings are negative, and they're still going down, and they just closed their biggest revenue maker, their location in Orlando. Their turnaround strategy? Opening a bunch of fucking put put golf courses, which they project bringing in $3m per year. However, all the comparable courses only bring in $1m or less per year. Their business strategy is fucked and their management is incompetent. Everybody who worked there when I visited looked like they hated their job and I saw some of the workers talking shit about management.

The $2.50 puts were super OTM when I bought them, but they've already made me a bunch of tendies and now they're solidly ITM. And the best part? This doesn't even take into account the beer virus. The Coronavirus will fuck $DS so hard and put them out of business by the end of the year. No boomers are going to a shitty TopGolf competitor when the Coronavirus is spreading.

27,ðŸ”¥Watchlist for 3/9-3/13ðŸ”¥,ffjpnk,mikehall1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ffjpnk/watchlist_for_39313/,1,24,"Big week coming up for traders in this market - many opportunities to make great trades that don't come around very often. I'll be discussing the top plays of the day every day LIVE on our Youtube channel @ 9AM eastern.

**SPEX** nice move Friday on serious volume, gapping after hours as well. I'll be watching this one for a specific play at the open called the opening washout long. We'll need to see a gap up Monday morning on volume to confirm continued interest into this week from buyers. Key levels ahead are $2.65/$3.00 as resistance - as long as we don't see any large red candles over 5m during pre / or an offering this play should be in tact.

**HTBX** Volume faded Friday after the big move on Thursday -- so Monday will be a very telling day for the future of this name. We'll need to see a reclaim over $0.90 w/ volume to break the $1.25 level. Key support level at $0.70 needs to hold on any dips Monday/Tuesday for continuation. I wouldn't be shocked to see another PR Monday/Tuesday to get it back above $1.00.

**BCRX** very bullish chart and overall trade thesis here - over $4.25 has a gap to fill towards the $7 area w/ a few forward looking events coming this month. Major watch if we continue to see higher lows above the $3.75 level.

**TOCA** clear daily breakout into the gap here worth watch Monday morning - either we see a consolidation day or continuation over highs. Key levels to watch $2.55/$2.88 on dips, see if they hold trend above that level and can retest highs over $3.00.

**SPY** volatility showing up like crazy lately, which gives us an opportunity to make money. Need to see a gap up tomorrow and a hold &gt; $293/$294 on dips w/ higher lows to see a rebound.

**VSTM** beautiful daily chart here coiled up for a nice breakout continuation towards $4 area -- $3.00/$3.10 key supports.",2020-03-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ffjpnk/watchlist_for_39313/

&gt;**Aurora Cannabis**Â (Â [TSE:ACB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACB/)) has had a rough start to 2020, with analyst after analyst taking hits at the struggling stock. A variety of factors are to blame for this, both within and outside the companies control, however what is for certain is the risks now associated with the company due to its $1.00 price range. Because of this, the company is at high risk of being taking off the national stock exchanges to be listed on the over the counter markets as a penny stock. If this happens, the outlook is even more uncertain due to the fact that stocks that are down-listed will have a harder time up-listing within a year of its down-listing.
