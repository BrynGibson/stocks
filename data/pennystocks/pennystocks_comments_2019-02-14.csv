Can you become rich? Yes of course sure....if you learn what your doing play all of your cards right and work hard at it. I started my journey 7 months ago with $600 in an account. I watched all the YouTube vids I could I signed up for a course ($200 with all access and a discord chat) and in the first 6 of those months I didn’t blow my account up...which I was happy about. Yet my total return was around $12. Lol...yep, my total account was $612....then I got lucky and one of the stocks I was in ran and I should have cashed out with $15k....but I didn’t. I thought it was going to go up more, so I waited. And the next day I cashed out with a total of $6k. Haha. Still an AWESOME return. But another lesson learned. Dude, there is SO much that goes into this. Is this or anything else a get rich quick overnight scheme...nope. You do have to “just do it” and hop in at some point and learn by trial and error.

“Toward the end of its fiscal 2019 second quarter, a buyer sent a termination letter to the company for a power purchase agreement associated with a project in Hawaii that would have ""provided significant upfront payments."" Though the letter was later retracted by the buyer, EnSync had already delayed or canceled orders for equipment it had ordered to fully supply the project in Hawaii. That ""severely negatively impacted relationships with some key suppliers,"" as well as the company's ability to pursue financing options, the release states.” 

One buyer, set the death spiral which imo could be fixed. 

Also pulled from 10-Q - “We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at September 30, 2018, and other potential sources of cash, including net cash we generate from closing projects in our backlog and pipeline, and potential financing options, will be sufficient to fund our current operations through the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we believe our pipeline of projects is deep, there can be no assurances that projects will close in a timely manner to meet our cash requirements. We are also working to improve operations and enhance cash balances by continuing to drive cost improvements and reducing our spend on research and development. Also, we are currently exploring potential financing options that may be available to us, including strategic partnership transactions, PPA project financing facilities, working capital lines of credit, and additional sales of Common Stock or other debt or equity securities. However, we have no commitments to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance such funds will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to increase revenues and achieve profitability in a timely fashion or obtain additional required funding, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the Company may not be able to continue operations, execute our growth plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to customers and competition.” 


Trading at its 52w low and nothing could really get any worse than the company dissolving. One investor/company PR of gaining stability and the price jumps. 

However, this is all imo. I’m willing to take a bet and potentially lose all my money invested here but there is also that chance. ",2019-02-14

Next day is important with 140 million shares traded the stock fell to .001 ( my experience tells me it didn’t stay there but a second buyers drove it back to .0002 where if you noticed it likes to stay( that makes it a support level ) and the next day boom volume jumps to 750 million and the price jumps to .0004 from.0002
