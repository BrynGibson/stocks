No one can argue that this is an extremely cheap investment that could pay off big time. Data is the new currency and MoviePass is collecting a ton of it! 

Please read below: 

“We get an enormous amount of information,” he said, noting the company knows subscribers’ addresses and can glean demographic information based on where they live. The company also can track subs via the app and a phone GPS. 

“We watch how you drive from home to the movies,” he said. “We watch where you go afterwards.” 

That sort of data fits into a long-term revenue plan. 

“Our bigger vision is to build a night at the movies,” he said, whereby MoviePass would direct subscribers to places to have dinner before or after a screening, for instance, getting a cut from vendors.

1,ACB.TO Question,8lovg6,ConnorSSB,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8lovg6/acbto_question/,3,7,"Backstory: 

I have a mentor/friend who devotes about 15% of his portfolio to penny stocks. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. He’s an old school investor in the sense that he does a ton of homework on companies he wants to invest in before doing so and holds/plays the long game. 

I’ve noticed him slipping a bit over the last few years - he’s getting older and having some health issues. At the same time, his routine and time he spends investing is what gives him purpose. 

His most recent penny stock purchase was  200,000 shares of ACB.TO back at around $11/share. He has faith in the company and plans to hold. He also has a sick family member who uses the oils they make - I think that definitely swayed his decision to invest so heavily. He ultimately expects the national legalisation of marijuana in Canada to send the stock back up. 

My question:

Obviously on paper he’s lost a good chunk of change thus far on ACB. I don’t have any experience with penny stocks and I’m not sure what to make of his investment. I know he could end up losing far more than he already has, or he could end up getting his money back and then some. 

Is my friend slipping? Is his judgement clouded? Would you hold onto ABC at this point? 

Thank you for your thoughts ",2018-05-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8lovg6/acbto_question/

19,Day trading penny stocks. Learn day trading setup for penny stocks.,8lwek7,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8lwek7/day_trading_penny_stocks_learn_day_trading_setup/,58,11,"Hello, traders, so here is the next video from my video project where I use Google’s search data to answer questions or explain search terms related to penny stocks. In today’s video I will talk about day trading penny stocks.

So I took many recent spikers and great stocks that were great day trading opportunities as examples so to give you idea what possible great setup looks like and what you need to look for to find one.

Watch the video: [https://youtu.be/rRJ\_4T1uSGo](https://youtu.be/rRJ_4T1uSGo)

If you are here just for the details \(or are more interested to read the content\) here are main points from the video:

1. When day trading penny stocks prefer nano cap size company’s stock. If you watched my previous videos you know that nanocap stock is stock with market capitalization less than $50mln. Why is that? Because low market cap stocks most of the time have low share float which basically is the cause for possible huge swings. As well if you still struggling with explanation for low float \- floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock \([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating\-stock.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp)\).
2. Look for huge/abnormal volume during trading day. This one is as well very important because then there are more shares traded than there is float we get what trades call float rotation meaning that float is traded more than once. As aside from this big volume allow for more liquidity during the increased volume time. Why this is important? Because it is easier to find other side of the bet, so trader can get it and out easily and can trade more shares.
3. Another great technical indicator you should look for is breakout. It is very important for stock price to break above multi week or even better multi month resistance level. If it does with bigger than usual volume for technical analysis perspective you can consider it as genuine breakout.
4. Other  important thing is to look for positive news. News article and great PR stunt attracts more participants to look at the stock and possibly to  trade it. Huge price spikes are accompanied with great and positive news for the company which shares are being traded. Well distributed news can influence stock volume by attracting more traders to trade stock.
5. And last but not least word for caution. Remember that most penny stocks after gapping up premarket will lose its value same day or more likely next day. This is why I even coined one of my strategies second day short because possibility that stock will finish next day in red after huge spike day is insanely huge. This is why I am more successful short selling these stocks and I as well welcome you to short sell these stocks. This is why I if I can I like to short sell them when day trading. But I am always looking for that next huge day trading opportunity \(I call them moby dicks\) to buy into like $CNET on Jan 2018. But if you want to know how I protect myself to buy into profitable day trades and avoiding possible selloffs after market open, watch the video, I shared my 10 minute rule which helps me avoid buying losing stocks.

Hope you guys liked this content and learned some new things about penny stocks. Let me know if this material is useful and if you have questions let me know them, I would love to hear from you.

And don’t forget to keep your trading risk in control!
