1,Weekly penny stocks recap $VTVT $AWSM $NFEC $MRIN $ADIL $ASTC $AKER,ab0gr6,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ab0gr6/weekly_penny_stocks_recap_vtvt_awsm_nfec_mrin/,1,0,"Summary

&amp;#x200B;

$VTVT was one of the hot stock this week. My guess that the two major forces behind the Friday move were a possible short squeeze and of course 10% owner buying shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous runner $AWSM price moved on Friday as well. No news were associated with the price increase. But looking at the historical price structure we can as well speculate that possible short squeeze was in play. Short sellers got to end their tax year as well:) 

&amp;#x200B;

$NFEC is still in my watchlist! This huge price bounce from 8$ to 19$ that occurred during these past weeks just showed how much volatile and unpredictable these stocks can be. Nevertheless, this stock most likely will see red January while there is clear overextended chart pattern that is showing that price peaked.

&amp;#x200B;

$MRIN most likely will suffer more losses upcoming week because same price structure that we see in $NFEC shows in $MRIN price structure. 

&amp;#x200B;

$ADIL is the stock that shows the importance of risk management. The stock has choppy price action, huge gaps, vague price trend. I took it off my watchlist and it came back this week. Even the news were kind of bullish the stock keeps up with its distorted price movement that is hard to trade around. I avoid trading this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

$ASTC moves on empty volume. Most likely the upward trend will not continue.

&amp;#x200B;

$AKER popped in my day trading screener twice. Still passed this stock while the move was more like natural corrective price move within the overall price structure. No news. No clear breakout. Not the day trading opportunity I would trade. As well stock broker new low.
