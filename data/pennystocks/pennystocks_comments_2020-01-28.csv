He is totally annoying and sounds scammy sometimes but his information is legit and he has tons of free stuff for beginners. 

That’s where I started and it helped me develop my style. If you want to start day trading it will take a while of learning so don’t blow up that 2K start small and stay small. 

Basically you’re going to want to learn a lot about trend lines, support and resistance. Those 3 concepts at minimum will give you a huge leg up on the average person. Even if you decide trading isn’t for you, with that you’ll at least know that throwing all your money into bitcoin without looking at a chart is absolute stupidity.
