3,"Overnight plays for 4/17 DPW, CELZ, GTGEF",8cywk0,dirtywiggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8cywk0/overnight_plays_for_417_dpw_celz_gtgef/,2,3,"I hope everyone got some great profits off my 3 picks yesterday as all went above 10% gains with great morning spikes for each. Wish I got more out of CELZ and listened more to my own picks. 

DPW is in the middle of a conference call now probably to announce something or talk about earnings. Low risk play. Good chart. 

CELZ is always one to watch very hard into close. If you are fast you can get some quick profits off of it in the morning spike but watch if it is not obeying. Well as I write this it is going parabolic but I hope it crashes down. Waiting for FDA news so people will be buying it. The CEO just bought 100k worth of shares yesterday so he has to know something. 

GTGEF is an interesting one. It is a known pump for sure and of course risky. Wolf of penny stocks always pumps up their weekly play(this) the morning after so I will be getting in very close to closing time here. Wish I got in this morning but did not get a fill.

If you can get it tomorrow early I’d say it’s going to have a nice pop.   

Check it out,  been watching it for a while thanks to some guys on the discord ",2018-04-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8d0r3q/owvi_tomorrow_continues/
