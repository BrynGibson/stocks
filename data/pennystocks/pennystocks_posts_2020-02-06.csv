12,Why would someone manipulate a stock to go down?,f01gev,DragonElder,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f01gev/why_would_someone_manipulate_a_stock_to_go_down/,1,9,For reference I am talking about the recent activity of ONTX. It went way down and I read a bunch that it was probably getting manipulated because it seemed like a great buy. How would lowering the cost of stocks benefit someone? Could it be the company itself trying to get more investors? I don’t think it was manipulated because usually a lack of news and a potential of bad news cause a stock to drop and that’s exactly what happened. But I don’t know the reason to manipulate a stock lower so once I know that I might have a better understanding.,2020-02-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f01gev/why_would_someone_manipulate_a_stock_to_go_down/
