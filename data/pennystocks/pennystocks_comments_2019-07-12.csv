Note 3 – Going Concern
We have not begun our core operations in the technology industry and have not yet acquired the assets to enter this markets and we will require additional capital to do so. There is no guarantee that we will acquire the capital to procure the assets to enter this market or, upon doing so, that we will generate positive cash flows from operations. Substantial doubt exists as to Tautachrome’s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustment has been made to these financial statements for the outcome of this uncertainty.

Because it depends what you're doubling, along with a lot of other factors.  

If you can only afford to spend five dollars, you shouldn't be investing in penny stocks.  You obviously need to keep that five dollars.   

Even if you can afford and you're just throwing it in there for fun....there are better ways to have fun with the money.  Go play the nickel slots at a local casino.  You'll have just as much a chance of doubling your five bucks, and you'll get a couple free drinks on the floor.",2019-07-12
