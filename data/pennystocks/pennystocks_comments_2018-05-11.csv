diagnostic devices, or for studies located OUS, FDA is generally not involved in evaluation of

If (for whatever reason) there is a reverse split of 10:1 your 100 shares become 10 shares. So in your case you had $3,000 invested at 0.001/ share, or 3,000,000 shares. If the company had done a 2:1 reverse split, you would only have 1,500,000 shares.

87,levishazam,dyuvps9,/r/pennystocks/comments/8inuff/hmny/dyuvps9/,1,"I've made and lost so much money on HMNY. Down about 14k at the moment. Holding and possibly averaging down soon. I don't think moviepass will go bankrupt. I'm getting emails about promotional offers and year subscriptions soon. I don't think they plan to exit the market. Tech companies like netflix, uber, airbnb, they all run negatively the first few years. I'd say that .65 right now is an insane deal, and that you should grab a thousand shares for the hell of it. You could lose, but this was at 2.30 before MP got on board, so I think you can at least double your money in the next 3 months. Worth the risk imo. Anyways... I'm holding my bag for now.

89,RealObieTrice,dyuw9rb,/r/pennystocks/comments/8irq2k/not_sure_how_to_get_my/dyuw9rb/,1,"You'll have to sign this stock certificate over to a broker who allows you to trade OTC stocks. Depending on how much money you invested, you can't just market sell the entire lot of shares you own in one go. This is because you'll clear the order book and tank the stock due to the lack of liquidity. 

Looks like some guy from Shark Tank just got involved with the company so I'd expect that $7MM market cap to increase over time. I'd suggest taking 25-50% out now and have some fun, pay off debt, etc., and let the rest ride. At this point it's free money and the upside is much greater than the downside right now. ",2018-05-11

I recently just started the ride on this this too and it's insane how many people have invested in this company and the CEO, ""drmo"" (he posts on Ihub frequently) and Kevin Harrington. Many of the Ihub company have literally been on the board or invested in this company for 3-5 years average. Most people think you'd be insane to give the CEO money directly, but from what I've heard and seen the guy is extremely hard working and resilient. This may actually be one of the few penny stocks that become legit, kind of like a Monster energy type story. This stock will likely be going much higher.",2018-05-11

99,Texas_Rangers,dyxrm8z,/r/pennystocks/comments/8inuff/hmny/dyxrm8z/,1,"The big problem is, there is no end in sight for dilution. 

The company promised an IPO in Spring 2018, but it looks like it's not happening. Farnsworth also promised just 13m Shares Outstanding by IPO. That didn't happen either (we're around 70m Shares Outstanding). 

We'd give Movie Pass a little more leeway to make money in the future, and shareholders shot the Market Cap of the company up to $200m plus at one point. And we'd do it again!

But shareholders are too scared about dilution. There's no upward buying power because the shareholders do not trust that dilution is over. 

The fallacy of seeing the stock price below $1.00 and thinking it's the bottom is as follows: it can still actually go lower. All it takes is going to $0.30, then threats of delisting, then a 20-1 split. You'll lose so much money so fast you won't know what hit you. ",2018-05-11
