All of these areas could be monitored and secured with this tech. In buildings that sensitive information is stored, those areas could be shut down to prevent cellphone signals from going out, and monitor who goes in and at what times. 

And on top of that, any business that chooses to use this tech is totally within their rights. We are monitored on cameras and by security personnel all the time in establishments, and no one freaks out. This is the same thing.
