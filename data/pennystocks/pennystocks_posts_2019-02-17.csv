5,Weekly recap for $MRIN $TPNL $SOLO +day trading setup for nano and micro caps,arjyqa,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/arjyqa/weekly_recap_for_mrin_tpnl_solo_day_trading_setup/,25,7," 

Please be aware of the bias I have on stock I cover here. Most of my positions are on the short side so please understand that I first look for stocks that make big moves so to short them later.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I start to review individual microcap stocks I would like to note you about USA stock market indices and their price action which affect many individual stocks. Stock indices keep moving upwords making many micro and nano cap stocks that I short go against me. So please be aware when shorting in this volatile market. Market feels chaotic and volatile making it hard to trade on the short side while position can go against you before actually reversing. I do believe in the next two weeks stock indices should peak and slide down making it easier to short sell stocks.

Now let’s get to individual stocks. 

$MRIN stock gapped down on Friday. Stock lost 33% because company reported lower revenue and bigger loss from operations year over year. I covered this stock some time ago in my previous recaps (December weekly recap videos). This is classical microcap stock with overextended chart pattern which always ends up losing all of its gains (most of the time). Why I talk about this stock? Because I do believe the main price move took place and from here we will see nothing but steady and slow selloff. As well shorting this stock at this point will only lock your available margin probably in profitable position but with very slow price action and your trading capacity will not be used practically. So I am taking this stock from my watchlist. I really recommend for everyone who has clutter in their watchlist to do regular cleaning every week. I have rule not to keep stock longer than 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

$TPNL is the stock I will probably cover more in the future. I talked about this stock last week and pointed out the overextended chart pattern that emerged. If you are new to penny stocks and to all of these a bit bigger micro cap stocks, remember, that this type of overextended price pattern never lasts (check monthly $TPNL chart). Just look at all cryptocurrencies and their chart year ago. This is typical chart pattern to look for if you are interested to short sell stocks. As well remember that 40% of individual stocks have negative lifetime returns (https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/11/39-of-stocks-have-a-negative-lifetime-total-return/). This should help you understand that 1) price cannot go up words to infinity, it will crash and 2) you have pretty big chances to be right on your short position on any given stock. I do believe we should see some more green for $TPNL before it will crash. I predict next month to be red for this stock.

$SOLO was great day trading opportunity. Company dropped hot news stating huge pre orders in comparison to it size. 2,4 billion in pre-orders! This is big! Of course it attracted many traders and investors. They poured big money into this stock on Wednesday helping stock to trade its float 3x. Combine this with valid resistance break with big volume and you will get formula for successful day trading low floating micro and nano cap stocks. The formula goes like this: great news + low float stock (best is to look for nano cap stocks) + float rotation (traded daily volume is bigger than float) + clear resistance = huge rally in stock price.

This is it for this week, hope you liked penny stock recap and gained some trading ideas for personal use. Let me know if you trade or monitor any of these stocks!",2019-02-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/arjyqa/weekly_recap_for_mrin_tpnl_solo_day_trading_setup/
