Huge props OP. I have been reporting on Seanergy (SHIP,) and have published articles here and on SeekingAlpha about both the fundamentals of the company and the industry. 

As a heads up, SHIP is one of the lowest valued low cap low float stocks (penny stock area,) but also has added risk due to the potential for more dilution, and in need of R/S to address share price by Jan 2020 to stay in good standing with NASDAQ and remain listed. 

Best of luck to you and all those who are in maritime shipping plays as well.",2019-09-04

They are now at semi annual status, a solid holder of that award. It seems they have to let each attempt run at least 6 months so 2 a year is probably max. But, can they repeat next year?  Unknown is just how long NASDAQ is gonna let the shit show continue. I think they missed the filing on last Friday for the 10-F with NASDAQ, wonder how that pans out cause if they did then it seems the 11-5 date gets pushed out since they have that 60 day wait period. I won't be surprised if trnx goes to 1.25-1.30 so not in too big a hurry to buy.",2019-09-04
