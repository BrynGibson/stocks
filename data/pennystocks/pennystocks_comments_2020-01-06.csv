it boils down to an accounting trick to prevent them from getting delisted from the NASDAQ.

My feeling though is that after the RS tomorrow we're probably going to see this train continue to fall. but who knows maybe we'll be lucky in the valuation will jump back by the end of the week.

unfortunately though, this is all speculation as there's no way to actually know what this is going to do at market open tomorrow for the true value of the shares.",2020-01-06

Follow trends, people think this year is Electric vehicle’s, 5G, Cannabis and US cannabis, Natural energy/Solar, and tech(chipmakers)

Im buying shares of SPCE once a week for longterm growth

Flipping pennys is easy if you dont watch too many stocks, stay away from OTC unless uplisting to nyse. Thats just me though, and any penny stocks on this forum be weary of and do your DD before buying someones pump

1. Do you buy those shares (26.5k for example) all at once or in small increments

2. Once you buy that amount of shares, does it influence the price of the stock? (I've been told the price of penny stocks are impacted more by orders from their low price) And by how much, or if there is a way to calculate that?",2020-01-06

They had $500k in cash at end of September, and took out $750k loan in November.  They raised $6.2m in an offering that was open from October through December.  That's issuing new shares, which essentially dilutes the value of the company across more shares - same way as the government printing more money devalues currency.  Projecting their cash burn rate forward, best estimate is they'll be broke any day now.  So they would need to do another offeding, unless they managed to dramatically improve their cashflow last quarter.  But the company never tells anyone what their new contracts are worth, so it's impossible to know that.  Next fiscal update won't be until end of March, and trust me a lot will have changed by then.",2020-01-06
