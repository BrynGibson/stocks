A very under the radar biotech investor who posts all of his trades real time bought it near the end of the day. You have to have an ‚Äúin‚Äù to follow him so no one really knows him but he triples his money every year and every time he buys a biotech with a sub $500m market cap you usually see a boost from him and his followers.

I made money twice on IGC but I don't see anything that is going to make a run like IGC did at the moment and considering the shadiness of the practice I would stay away.

The run on NLST is over and anyone that tells you that another run on NLST is coming is most likely a bag holder who didn't sell when they should have.  Looking at the charts its on a long slow decline back to its value previous to the run.  Each day that goes by another bag holder cashes out.

Hold ACBFF for sure as long as you can stand it.  The others I know very little about but from their charts they look like they have potential to make gains long.

In pennystock land always take the anything you can above 25% in a day and don't get greedy.  

If you are looking to shift into some other stocks that still have some very potential future runs in the are HIPH and FSDDF.  

XXII looks like another future runner if the cannabis stock hype continues.

Pumpers got it for a day or two and back down it slowly goes as bags drop.  I see if going back to .99 or less unless they have some awesome breakthrough news and not fluff.  

As with most P&amp;D situations beware the bag holders holding out hope because they took the advice to hold from someone that sold long ago and took profits.  Learn to look for trends in pumpers promoting stocks.  They are often making money up and down by pushing the stock onto less experienced traders telling them the sky is the limit.  Those people buy on a run and those who hold looking for more profit end up getting burned by those same experienced traders who are now shorting it.
