1,Wendys_4_Tendies,e79ao51,/r/pennystocks/comments/9lt0fi/noob_looking_for_advice/e79ao51/,1,there are a lot of videos on youtube. Also there is a subreddit dedicated to robinhood penny stocks. [r/robinhoodpennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/)  also be aware of the pattern day trader rule that you cant trade more than 4 times within 5 business days as that could potentially screw you if you aren't paying attention. Start small don't all in and good luck! ,2018-10-06

Learn patience

Do not have day trading be your model, buy companies, not tickets.

Beware of FOMO (fear of missing out), don't dive in too fast. Read the companies' SEC 8K files. If you learn to read these, you will be ahead of the game. Learn trading nomenclature at Investopedia. 

I only started trading pennystocks this last February. I found a stock. Read up in everything I could find about it, it's founder's LinkedIn account, it's product line, market sector, competition, etc. Still holding those shares. I'm up 60% on them. What I found was an actual company with a real product and an emerging market for it.

I've tried to apply the same to other stocks with a good amount of success.

I use Robinhood, but also TDAmeritrade for it's ThinkOrSwim app. That is a powerful tool.
