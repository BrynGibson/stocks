If you're day trading then you probably want this to break even and walk away, if it's a company you actually are invested in theres no time table for a turnaround. Some stocks may take 5 years to see real growth but if you're a fan of the company then theres nothing wrong with supporting them. If you're looking for quick flips I look at stocktwits a lot and watch how many people are watching specific stocks. For example, NVAX, FCEL, PLUG have all been highly anticipated stocks. NVAX jumped 5 dollars a stock with coronavirus, FCEL landed a deal with toyota and state of california for hydrogen engines or some shit and I havent researched PLUG.... basically in conclusion, if you are investing in the company stay long it doesn't matter if you sit in the hold position, if you're looking for a quick buck, look for the pumpers and try to get in and out before they get to stage 2 which is dumping (classic pump and dump, news or earning call coming, pump pump, right before or right after dump and dont forget to tell people to buy on all dips with rocket ship emojis) also be sure to monitor if stagnant stocks have a reverse split in their future mode companies give notice if they are doing that or if they are doing a merger",2020-02-19

I just realized today bits been a little over a week since it underwent a trading halt. Usually that happens to prevent news from affecting the share price dramatically...good or bad. I’m thinking the halt is what is keeping it on the up and up during this correction. I wish it dipped, I want in 😝

Little tough in this market because it seems to be mostly based off speculation, rather than solid companies. 

Wouldn’t feel comfortable recommending anything atm. Kinda why I really like xxii because regardless of the ups and downs (which are great in normal markets) I can see major long term potential as well. Any of the pharmaceutical stocks will probably crash if they can’t do anything in regards to the corona virus.",2020-02-19
