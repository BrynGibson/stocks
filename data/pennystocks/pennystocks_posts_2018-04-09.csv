We are looking forward to releasing information regarding several exciting projects in the coming weeks and months. While I wish I could share everything right now – we have a series of patent applications and partnerships in late stages of evolution that are progressing towards activation.

Instead of focusing solely on cryptocurrency portfolios, Cryptobloc has assembled a leadership team that will leverage their experience working with market leaders including Microsoft, Farfetch, Tesla and Layer7 to deliver ambitious projects based on Real-World Distributed Application Designs. 

Like the KYC and AML services that our first acquisition 1Linx provides for our lead client Coinbase.Cryptobloc is developing both software and hardware infrastructures to serve the growing market for blockchain solutions.

 In the coming weeks Cryptobloc Technologies will be announcing a series of projects across Canada, the United States, and International Markets.",2018-04-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ay4n4/cryp_starts_trading_today_amazing_update/

7,"Watchlist for Monday: ANDI, CELZ, TNKE, GOPH, DTST",8avyxw,dirtywiggles,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8avyxw/watchlist_for_monday_andi_celz_tnke_goph_dtst/,1,0,"With ANDI you always know by 12:00 how it is going for the day and usually will indicate if it will hold its support and go up or if it will gently fall all day. I have had this for 2 days and may add more depending on what I see. ANDI even has good dip buys and seems to be heading in a good direction with news as a catalyst. 

CELZ is a weird monster but is very volatile and a good play can last 5 minutes. Always watching for a dip but this is very risky. 

TNKE is a very thinly traded stock that has bottomed out and a good chart with a bounce that has started. Hard to get shares but I am holding long in a small position. 

GOPH was a multiday runner. Was. Now it is calming down a bit after its correction but still actually is not a bad company overall. Even then it has dips and isn't too thinly traded if you are looking for gains a little below 10% on a dip. 

DTST seems like it will have a morning spike for the first hour on all hype and then die. I could see this jumping double digits then crashing in the negative by 30% on the day after the first hour. Look at the chart history. 

ANDI is the best easily so far and it will be interesting to watch it all day.
