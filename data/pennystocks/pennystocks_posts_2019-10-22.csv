The program is scheduled to begin rolling out in November 2019 initially in the Seattle, WA area focusing on the “couch moments” when consumers most order desserts and the “craving coffee” periods.

“Ben &amp; Jerry’s [https://www.benjerry.co.uk/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eLnXKMN6_g9Ou1b3w4HhSfAwQg-IxkYTC6VoABsQCWYER2M6vh01iaSr5rqNZ6NXGG0aU9Jo8gWtXdoRuzSBF6MPsjM26pJtzH6hbXFZZWQ=) operates on a three-part mission that aims to create linked prosperity from everyone that’s connected to our business. From marriage equality to cow-friendly farming, there are many issues we hold close to our hearts.” Ben &amp; Jerry’s

ReelTime has a successful history with Baristas Coffee having previously created and produced Baristas TV advertisements seen during NFL Monday and Thursday Night Football with Megs McLean, The NFL London Game, on NBA TV, during Shark Tank on CNBC with Front Montgomery, on NBA TV, CNN, ESPN, Food Network, and other various TV channels.

Barry Henthorn CEO stated: ""The opportunity to work on the Baristas and Ben &amp; Jerry’s partnership as the exclusive media partner is a very big opportunity to showcase the revolutionary capabilities that ReelTime Media has to gain exposure and drive consumers to products at a fraction of the cost of placing traditional media. The advanced capabilities of creating metrics that drive positive ROIs for our customers coupled with the ability to blend in new and emerging media is causing a shift in the way companies are evaluating their media campaigns.”

12,People are Leaving this subreddit because of this..,dl9x9q,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl9x9q/people_are_leaving_this_subreddit_because_of_this/,56,13,"You may have noticed the numbers have dropped significantly on this subreddit. A few people mentioned in other subreddits that /r/pennystocks is a dead forum because the OTC market is dead. Others said it's due to the low quality posts that frequently make their way to the front page. Whether either of these things are actually what's happening, something that people need to talk about is what can change. How can this subreddit change into something amazing, something that we can all learn from?

Unfortunately, a prosperous vision of this subreddit would be nearly impossible without the right guidance. Many people have offered me to become a moderator of their subreddit. /r/Daytrading has sent me several DMs asking for me to become a moderator. I declined everytime. It might be time that this subreddit gets revamped. Free of spam, low effort posts, and promotions. 

As of tomorrow, I will be taking over as a moderator of this subreddit. I'd like to thank many of you who've vouched on my behalf. The amount of support has been amazing. 

Here's the game plan for the next upcoming months on this subreddit:
-

* We are going to restore dignity and high quality posts.

* We are going to provide educational material that allows traders to create their own decisions.

* We are going to enforce the rules by adding a 3 strike rule. No promotions are allowed anymore.

* We are going to make /r/pennystocks a useful tool in the toolbox.

* We are going to bring weekly posts and for-fun contests. 

* Freedom to post is encoraged and questions are encoraged. 


Thank you all again for this opportunity. I will do a great job for you all, and we are going to make this subreddit amazing.

Happy Trading! -

13,"Last post on Shippers, results",dl9h1j,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl9h1j/last_post_on_shippers_results/,2,1,"Well folks I offered a few posts on shippers over the past few months. I, like many others thought the shippers may have a nice pump much like they did last year. They still may. But personally I decided  to pull my funds today. Why? I am not seeing enough activity. I expected these to have more momentum at this point and as I see it they don’t. The worst thing about getting in on a coming pump is knowing that if you don’t get out quick enough it will dump before you can get out. Had these tickers shown more momentum I would have stayed longer. 

    Now there’s a chance  it will pump later this year. It could start this week or next. If so good luck for those that stay for the ride. I put in 10G’s a month and a half ago and I cashed in with 22% green across the board. That’s not bad and I made a decent return but it’s not the return I was hoping for. I was shooting for 75% plus. If It runs and I miss it I just miss it but my thoughts are that if some of the traders start seeing the lack of support that I see, there will be a quick and sudden selloff. I’ll take my measly 22% and be thankful. 

   So.... if you bought when I first alerted you are be 22% richer right now. If you hold you may get lucky. 

    Good luck to you all. I’ve rolled all my shipping investment over into UGAZ so I hope we get a hard core blizzard soon. 

    That’s as straight as I can shoot it from my perspective guys. Good luck",2019-10-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dl9h1j/last_post_on_shippers_results/
