0,Is the $CVSI run-up over?,8p6b5i,Petroselinum_,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8p6b5i/is_the_cvsi_runup_over/,1,14,"Bought in the first time at 1.09 but sold for quick gains at 1.20. Still pissed I didn’t hold.

Second time around, I bought in at 2.54, nearly at the ATH. What a mistake. It tumbled more than 8% the next day. Predictable, since that parabolic increase just wasn’t sustainable. 

Thus begs the question - is the run-up truly over? Or is it just going to bounce off support levels at ~$2.03 and continue to rise? Should I sell for a 10% loss? Or, should I continue to hold... and risk bag-holding the damn thing? (And, does the Senate Hemp Bill even actually mean anything for $CVSI?)

Want to mention that I lost over 70% of my portfolio because I went all-in $RXMD and bag-held past the point of recovery - I went in at $0.2385, sold at $0.08.  Point is, I don’t want to bag-hold again, so I want to be cautious about hanging on to $CVSI for too long.

TL;DR - lost most of my money bag-holding $RXMD. Feels like shit. Don’t want to feel like shit again by messing up my $CVSI play.",2018-06-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8p6b5i/is_the_cvsi_runup_over/
1,I'm up 3200% on LRDR (bought in at $0.001). Still plenty of room to grow if anyone wants a medium/long play.,8p7gv8,sensicle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8p7gv8/im_up_3200_on_lrdr_bought_in_at_0001_still_plenty/,24,29,"It's a Joseph Arcaro reverse merger (see NUGS, WSML, CYPE which is just barely ahead of LRDR in terms of merger progress), VUME, and many others. 

These tend to run over 10 cents fairly easily and interest is certainly accruing in LRDR since its sister company, CYPE, went sub penny to $0.60 this year. LRDR will almost certainly cross a nickel within a couple weeks in my opinion and continue steadily as it has been. 

It's great to be kicking ass in pennies again. I haven't done this well in 4 years. Currently holding 1M shares even.

6,How to find penny stocks? +simple swing trading screener setup,8pczyw,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8pczyw/how_to_find_penny_stocks_simple_swing_trading/,63,6," This is one of the questions I get asked a lot. The first thing you need to know that there is a lot of stocks to choose from and you need a way to filter out this huge amounts of stocks in order to get to the ones you would be interested to trade. Especially when we are talking about micro and nano\-cap stocks aka penny stocks. There are tons of these small stocks floating on the stock market.

Traders use various stock screeners to help them narrow opportunities to trade and this is where stock screener comes in handy.

If you are just beginner try to use screener provided by [www.finviz.com](http://www.finviz.com/). It is free screener and it does a great job in helping you to filter out huge amounts of stocks. I use this screener in my trading to find swing trading ideas.

Now just to add here. Remember that online stock screeners most of the time do not provide real\-time price data, meaning you will not be able to find stocks that satisfies screener inputs in real time. Most of the time you will need to pay for real\-time price data. This is a problem for day traders because you will need real\-time data while you cannot lose time, while most of the time free screeners provide price data delayed by 20 minutes. This is too much of the time for the day trader to lose.

**BUT** there is one option beginner penny stock day trader can use and that is Yahoo finance screener. It is real time and can help you with finding all kind of liquid small cap stocks traded on Nasdaq or even OTC. Just look for equity screener, select small cap and you can then filter out stocks by percentage change which will help you to show biggest losers and biggest gainers or you can filter out stocks by volume size to show most liquid ones, etc.

As well if you are just beginning to trade and at this right moment, you are looking for online stock broker ask if the broker provides stock screener with a trading platform.

BONUS: if you are interested to know how to use Finviz screener to filter out all micro and nano\-cap stocks traded on Nasdaq, NYSE and Amex stock exchanges and would like to copy paste simple swing trading screener to find your own swing trading ideas watch the video.
