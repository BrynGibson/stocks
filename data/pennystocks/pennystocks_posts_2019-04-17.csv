Went down more than 50% at times, but it always seemed like a promising idea so I hung onto it. They make a kind of spider silk, with the aim to mass produce it for textiles. Polartec makes fabrics for lots of major brands like North Face, as well as military clothing. This is the first time it looks like they really will put on a commercial product on the market in the near future. Up 49% on the day as Iâ€™m typing this.

The biotech penny stock announced that the ongoing research it has undertaken at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has shown that Annamycin is capable of improving survival rates in animal models.Â  These particular survival rates are in animals with an aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs. Annamycin is the companyâ€™s clinical stage drug.

All it says is that it's a suit for investors that lost money due to the drop, but I don't see how that's fair if there was no foul play and it was souly based on the FDA's decision. Would the investors try to argue that the company should've alerted them that it might not pass FDA inspection?
