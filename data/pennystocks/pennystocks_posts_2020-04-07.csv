### Viemed increases Q1 revenue guidance to $23.7-million

2020-04-06 14:17 PT - News Release

Mr. Casey Hoyt reports

VIEMED HEALTHCARE RAISES FIRST QUARTER GUIDANCE AND PROVIDES UPDATE ON OPERATIONS AND RESPONSE TO COVID-19 VIRUS

Viemed Healthcare Inc. is increasing its previously issued net revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the company is providing an update on current operations and its response to the growing number of COVID-19 cases around the country.

 As previously disclosed, in response to the COVID-19 virus, the company began modifying its clinical protocols to limit unnecessary patient encounters to ensure the safety of its employees, as well as the safety of its patients. At this time, these measures do not appear to be negatively impacting the company's patient attrition rate. The company's current ability to assess potential patients in hospitals varies by hospital and city, but over all, the company's business of setting up new patients in the home is continuing.

Additionally, the company is working with various governmental agencies and health systems around the country to assist in the response to the COVID-19 virus. The company continues to be a resource to help transition patients with chronic respiratory failure, amongst other disease states, out of the hospital quicker to free up valuable hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. The company is working to source equipment for third parties to be used in acute facilities to assist COVID-19 patients, and is preparing to mobilize certain of its therapists to educate other clinicians on ventilators, as well as to provide critical care in the facilities that need this assistance. The company is actively fulfilling equipment orders in the more severely COVID-19 impacted areas of Louisiana and New York, and continues to work with these states and others to help during this pandemic.

 As mentioned herein, the company has fulfilled some of the orders that have been received to date, and **anticipates fulfilling a larger amount during the second quarter**. The company continues to receive new equipment, and has been utilizing a portion of its existing equipment to assist with the immediate COVID-19 crisis while continuing to meet the needs of its patient base. As a result of these sales of new equipment, the company is revising its previously issued guidance and currently estimates that first quarter 2020 net revenues will be approximately $23.7-million to $23.9-million. Additionally, sales of previously used equipment will be recognized in gain on disposal of property and equipment in the company's financial statements and are currently estimated to be approximately $1.4-million to $1.5-million. Second quarter guidance based on this growing demand is expected to be provided during May in conjunction with the reporting of the company's first quarter results. The extent and duration of the effect of these additional sales on the company's operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak and actions taken by the government and private business to attempt to contain the COVID-19 virus, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.

""I am very proud to see that the quick actions we have taken so far appear to be keeping our growing patient base comfortable in their homes and our employees safe, and there appears to be only positive impacts from our modifications of the treatment regimens,"" said Casey Hoyt, Viemed chief executive officer. **""We recognize that being one of the largest home-based ventilator companies in the country puts us in a unique position to help with the current pandemic.** We have long said our ventilator inventory and our network of respiratory therapists around the country are our two largest assets. Our team is working tirelessly on all potential solutions to help the government and health systems during this COVID-19 crisis.""

6,Hard Facts: Just Two Penny Stocks Turned Into Billion Dollar Companies In The Past 10 Years,fwanqk,Kyism,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fwanqk/hard_facts_just_two_penny_stocks_turned_into/,1,23," Only **Sirius XM** (satellite radio) and  **Accelerate Diagnostics** (health testing company) has become billion-dollar companies in the past 10 years based off this article:

[https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/penny-stocks-billions-only-two-rare-examples/](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/penny-stocks-billions-only-two-rare-examples/) 

As a newer investor, it is important to understand the facts about penny stocks and what we should realistically expect from them the next time someone comes on here and plays with our inexperienced minds. It's easy to think that investing in a penny stock with a lot of money will mean that if you hold onto it long enough you will never work another day in your life again and you can afford all the ladyboys you want but the hard facts is that opportunity has only happened twice in the past 10 years. 

So while I do not think we shouldn't be optimistic about the companies we choose to invest in we should also realize that expecting them to become billion-dollar companies and their stock going from under $1 to worth $60 is incredibly unrealistic and setting us up to be the bagholders for the more experienced minded traders who know this.",2020-04-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fwanqk/hard_facts_just_two_penny_stocks_turned_into/

52,IMIMF Primed for Long,fwm5qm,Knight_Aero,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fwm5qm/imimf_primed_for_long/,1,2,"IMIMF is the OTC symbol for IMC International Mining Corp. There is an equal CSE symbol: IMCX. The gold mining and exploration company has honestly shown a lot of promise in the past month especially. IMIMF is just over .52 this morning has been climbing up over 80% from .28-.3ish in past 2-3 weeks since its recent land acquisition became official. There is another investor meeting this afternoon that will discuss more than likely the survey plans for its new land holding which has apparently proven profitable in the past. That survey originally was planned for end of April I believe. Assuming the Coronavirus situation doesn't cause delays and it trends like other mining stocks in the past, the price could easily exceed $1 or $1.50 by the time they start mining in a few weeks or months especially if the survey is extremely positive. Mining stocks can be really trick but this company seems to know what they are doing from what I have read. Thoughts?
