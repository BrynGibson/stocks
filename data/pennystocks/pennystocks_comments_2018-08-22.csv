41,Fiddli,e4o5xka,/r/pennystocks/comments/99g764/canb_the_next_cvsi/e4o5xka/,1,"Green again, by how much?  idk 

Let me give you my view of the layout. It seems like not a lot of people knew about this company and scanners have been going off the past 3 days so traders are now looking at them. The problem is that there seems to be A LOT of side money all waiting for a pullback/dip/correction what ever you want to call it. New money thinks they missed out and don't want to pay the premium so they want to wait for pullback/dip/correction. This is an issue when so many are waiting for the same thing to happen. As soon as the price dips some people jump the gun and buy it instantly, another dip happens and its bought up again. There is no time for a solid pull back in price because everyone is trying to get in. This is all based on my view of Level 2 for the past 3 days. The volume traded is huge as well and the float is tiny (50 million). Today in level 2 I noticed ASCM on the bid. For those not familiar with ASCM they are a MM who make most of their profit from shorting. 2/3 of the day they had bids set at .027 when the price was at .044!! Tell me why the last 2 hours they moved from .027 to .047 then .054  on the bid and every time we got close or past .06 they would sell blocks of 10,000 and set up walls for the price to not keep rising? They are trying to COVER!! They messed with the wrong stock and are massively exposed in a large short position on a stock with a 50 million float. They are scared out of their minds and need large amounts of shares. I believe ASCM will attack the bid early as soon as markets open in order to scare people into selling into their bid where they will try to absorb as many shares as possible to cover their short position.  There will be a small pull back maybe 12% tops where there wont be enough shares for both ASCM and side money so it will spike back up and push us heavy into green again.

&amp;#x200B;

 TLDR; ASCM will scare weak hands in the morning, weak hands will sell, not enough shares being sold on the dip to satisfy demand from ASCM &amp; people on the sideline (because of tiny float). This will cause FOMO and we back in the green.
