0,Next week a few I’m watching,8yzbtk,Budd0413,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8yzbtk/next_week_a_few_im_watching/,6,4,"I’m thinking AAPH, BLUU, have serious upside , I’m liking the Alessi plays right now,   

BFCH May take a few but this sub .006 is super cheap 

BIOQA has multiple bidders lined up is so stupid undervalued it’s crazy.   

Still long on LDSI, that’s gonna break .01 again shortly.  

Sub .02 SGTN is a great spot also

U.S. stores will be opening at the end of summer, revenues increasing brand is building traction. Due for a run IMHO, I sold near the high but I am back in now at 0.165, this looks to be bottom.
