1,ModerateStockTrader,dt0bbmz,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rw63k/can_i_trade_us_penny_stock_in_australia/dt0bbmz/,1,"Google it. I've only traded Canadian OTC so far with varied success. One stock I wanted wouldn't execute after an hour so I cancelled it. This was only a week after the OTC was issued. I will guess that there was no shares yet for me to have bought even though the original stock on the Canadian exchange was being traded. As far as the 2nd stock, it had a screwey ask/bid. I did however buy shares of Glance Technologies Inc. ($GLNNF) so it is possible.

Just open an account with a US based broker (http://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/broker/index.aspx). I would also like to add that if you have the money, you might want to use a sound broker and not a discount one as the former will provide you with level II quotes and a good charting software.",2018-01-21

6,Boots-n-Bell,dt0tu8m,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rxa3p/lmfa_1_mil_float_with_50_short/dt0tu8m/,1,I love low floats personally. Classic case of supply and demand. Less shares so when you get good news they aren‚Äôt easy to buy so price runs fast. ,2018-01-21
7,ModerateStockTrader,dt16j46,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rxa3p/lmfa_1_mil_float_with_50_short/dt16j46/,1,"These are my thoughts too. I need to get a more former and fundamental understanding of stock trading though. As for now, I'm just picking up stuff as I go.

What are your fav low float/low outstanding stocks?

Mine are INTV and NUGS. They move like 10% or more with low volume. 200k volume is enough to send them moving.

The stocks with the opposite effect are CBIS, TEUM and TRTC. I bought that CBIS in a rush and paid for it. It dropped 20% after I purchased it and it is stuck teetering around the .10c range.

I did more research to find out why it wasn't moving with 50 mil volume and found out that it had 2 billion shares outstanding!",2018-01-21

10,Boots-n-Bell,dt1g1mb,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rxa3p/lmfa_1_mil_float_with_50_short/dt1g1mb/,1,"Yeah I still like the potential of TEUM. IÔ∏è was in it and made a little last week. For me personally it‚Äôs all about developing your own system. I have read a ton of success stories and a ton of failure stories. I have tried to blend them all together. Never going to be perfect with your picks, but about limiting loses and maximizing gains. So my system is real simply. ‚ÄúOnly buy stocks with good news,  sell immediately if they drop, and hold if they running but as soon as volume slows then sell.‚Äù  

It let‚Äôs you bail quick on bad picks and let‚Äôs you keep making money if it is climbing. Since middle of December i have made about 50 trades and have been 80-85% percent accurate at least. 

Number one rule is keeping emotions out of it. By far hardest part of the game.

In today‚Äôs day and age its so easy to use all resources available.  I always use linkined to find company‚Äôs employees. Then i add them on social media. Very good way to see what the company is up too ",2018-01-21
11,Boots-n-Bell,dt1guzt,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rxa3p/lmfa_1_mil_float_with_50_short/dt1guzt/,1,I have found my biggest wins normally happen when IÔ∏è own a stock for around an hour or less. I never want to be holding a stock unless it‚Äôs a start up company and IÔ∏è see crazy growth coming soon. For example IÔ∏è was in DPW for 15 mins a few weeks ago for a solid $1150 gain. In and out and take your profit even if it‚Äôs a few bucks. ,2018-01-21
12,Boots-n-Bell,dt1h1jo,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rxa3p/lmfa_1_mil_float_with_50_short/dt1h1jo/,1,Ok last one. But i would never get in a company like this one (LMFA) with it being shorted at a 50% rate. Only way I would think about IÔ∏èt is with crazy good news and the shorts are starting to cover. So the run would be happening and I‚Äôd get in and out fast. With that many shorts you know people will double down and keep shorting IÔ∏èt.  ,2018-01-21

Looked awesome for us. Investor relations has been sending me great info. And their executives reply to me directly on twitter. Looks like ticket sales start in April and flights by June. Nice 3.50$ Price target by spring. IÔ∏è found their prices for flights and many other big things in interviews their executives have done over the last two months. By end of year IÔ∏è believe we easily 10-20x the price by looking at similar airlines that have started up around the world using this same Ultra low cost carrier (ULCC) method! ,2018-01-21
