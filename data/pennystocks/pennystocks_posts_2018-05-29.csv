1,My watchlist,8mvwwf,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8mvwwf/my_watchlist/,25,10,"Hey, guys, as most of you know I've been trading penny stocks for over 8 years now. My penny stock strategies consist of many different styles simply because I have to adapt to the fluctuations and changes in the market. That being said, I don't have a lot of stocks in this particular watchlist since I only trade stocks above $1.00 w/ high relative volume. Most of the successful penny stock traders I know trade between $2-$5 penny stocks. Only 3 stocks were generated from my stock screener today. Here is the following list:

VTGN $1.47 +51.55%


ADOM $1.64 +50.46%


PXS $1.31 +21.30%


VTGN - Stock closed at my divisible by 5 rule. Based on the past 4 historical climax patterns there's a higher probably of another climax pattern occurring. Tomorrow the stock could crash as we've seen in the past w/ this stock.


ADOM - This stock topped out at $1.70 the other day so I would keep this as a level or resistance and we might see a double top pattern (for my students that's in video 5). If stock can sustain a level above $1.70, it would make a great buying opportunity as the volatility could keep it moving higher.


PXS - Some penny stock traders were talking about this on Friday, expecting it to go higher ($2-$3). Substantiated by what, exactly? Stock stopped at my divisible by 5 rule as well and came crashing back down to the $1.30s.
