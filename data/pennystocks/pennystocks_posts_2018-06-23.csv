1,PNO.V on TSX received $30 mill contract friday,8t9it8,IamMat,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8t9it8/pnov_on_tsx_received_30_mill_contract_friday/,15,25," PNO.V on friday received a contract for $30 mill +, trading at .085 CAD.  This is a company with assets of over $100 million, $10 million cash on hand and now going forward cash flow positive.  


With the new OPEC agreement, oil prices are surging as of friday afternoon!  This stock is trading significantly under fair value.  Almost a decade ago it was trading at $30+ when oil was surging - as it's starting to again.  


This company is the real deal and an investment at this level could potentially change your life.  Please look at the financials, the news on friday and see why this is an ACTUAL investment that can yield fruit compared to chasing fluff and rumours!
