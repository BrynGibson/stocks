0,Honest review of a boiler room trading course.,aov0xn,alhinx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aov0xn/honest_review_of_a_boiler_room_trading_course/,1,26,"Disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with boiler room team.

I’ve been looking around for a trading course for a while now. Tim Sykes offer multiple of them but they are way too expensive $400+ each and warrior trading is almost $4000 dollars. I found out about boiler room on YouTube and decided to check out their content. They have a variety of free videos there if you want to check them out. 

They also offer a program for only $30 and it includes one month of chatroom access.( I believe you can pay $250 for a full year access)The program is packed with useful content for pretty much anyone who’s looking to trade. They go from a beginner level to advanced . It also includes in-depth level 2, penny stocks,  different trading strategies and so on. The program also included commodities trading and option trading. 

I’m almost done with the program and I’ve learned so so much. And again I’m not advising you to go and purchase this program but if you’re looking for a good one for a cheap price I would highly recommend this one. Hope it helps!

2,Limit Orders and Stop Limit Orders,aou2ua,botmot,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aou2ua/limit_orders_and_stop_limit_orders/,1,8,"Hey guys, newer to the stock market and OTC market. I’m wondering how to use limit orders and stop limit orders efficiently. 

So far I’ve only used limit orders and I’m not even really sure how I’m supposed to be using stop limits.

I’ve had some success already but I just want to make sure I’m doing everything as efficiently as possible and not missing out on earnings.

Thanks!",2019-02-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aou2ua/limit_orders_and_stop_limit_orders/
3,GDET more room for breakout with a target price of 0075,aowymm,miamidd12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aowymm/gdet_more_room_for_breakout_with_a_target_price/,1,3," 

### GDET is a Crypto Penny Stock Trading Under a Penny with over 749%Upside with a Return To 52-Week Highs 

Although the cryptocurrency market pulled back from its highs… the technology is still powerful. Banks like JPMorgan Chase, and companies like Microsoft have been leveraging blockchain technology. That said, at these valuation levels, the cryptocurrency market could have immense upside potential.

By 2021, Statista is projecting the blockchain technology market to surpass $2B.

However, some research firms are projecting higher growth rates. For example, Grand View Research forecasts the blockchain technology market to reach $7.59B by 2024 – a 37.2% compound annual growth rate for the forecast period.

That in mind, companies who are still in the space have an advantage. There’s one blockchain-oriented company focused on becoming one of the premier cryptocurrency mining facilities. That said, if the cryptocurrency market rebounds, it would not be surprising to see this stock grow at an exponential pace over a short period.

**GDET**, is a result driven, blockchain-oriented company focused on becoming a premier Cryptocurrency mining facility. GDET will build and manage a Cryptocurrency mining colocation and mining facility that is client-focused and dedicated to creating a new standard in the Blockchain space based on security and transparency. GDET has also developed a strong relationship with suppliers overseas to ensure future purchasing.",2019-02-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aowymm/gdet_more_room_for_breakout_with_a_target_price/

Jordan Crook@jordanrcrook / 3 months ago

￼

Wellness app Calm has today announced a $3 million equity investment in XpresSpa Group, a fast-spa service you may have noticed in your local airport. Calm  sees the investment as a way to expand its offline presence, growing awareness of the app as well as its retail products like Sleep Mist and the Calm Book.

Calm subscribers will have access to a variety of in-store benefits and treatments at one of 52 XpresSpa locations in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York.

As investor and general interest around mental health and wellness grows, Calm has carved out its slice of the pie. The company has raised $28.5 million from investors Insight Venture Partners and Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, with a $250 million valuation.

The app is, for all intents and purposes, a content hub for folks looking to bring more calm into their life. This can range from in-the-moment meditation sessions to tracks to help you sleep. The company has also introduced a music hub and a video hub for “mindful movement and gentle stretching.”

A Calm subscription costs $69.99/year. The app has 36 million users, with more than 1 million paid users.

“The greatest challenge (and opportunity) for Calm is waking people up to mental fitness,” said Dun Wang, VP of Product &amp; Growth, in an email. “It’s becoming more and more common now, but it’s definitely been a challenge for us. We have a massive poster of a 1970s People Magazine cover in our office. Farrah Fawcett is on the cover in this crazy 70s workout get up and the cover reads “the craze of jogging.” Mental fitness is growing in both importance and popularity, similarly to physical fitness in the 70s.”

Here’s what co-founder and co-CEO Michael Acton Smith had to say in a prepared statement:

The need for mental fitness in our stressed, fast-paced world is clear, and we’ve already seen a tremendous increase in our digital user base, growing 110% percent in downloads this year. By partnering with XpresSpa, we’re expanding beyond our core app offering to reach more offline consumers, and dialing in on a common consumer pain point: traveler stress.

With the XpresSpa partnership, Calm can capitalize on the stress of travel, not only converting people over to the app but doing so at a time when the user is likely to engage.

I want to sell a portion of the shares when the next trading day opens at hopefully around $.60 price point.

I use Charles Schwab to trade and when I go to sell the estimated value of the transaction uses a $.11 bid price point. Is this the value in which my share will sell, or this estimate off just because of the high volatility of the OTC market? 

Thanks in advance y’all, I’m new to Pennystocks but I’ve had a blast following this thread and want to get more involved, cheers!  ",2019-02-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aotug6/shmp_new_to_penny_stocks_and_otc_market_looking/
