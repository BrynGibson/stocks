I am writing this post in order to tell you that I believe this stock will soon be suspended, and you should get out while you can.

I am not an owner of this stock, nor do I want to be. I heard about it 3 days ago, and upon conducting my own DD was unsatisfied with what I saw. They employ less then 10 people, and are attempting to partner with the biggest e-commerce firm on the planet. Amazon could easily buy them; why havent they? Most likely because this is a front company just like DECN was, pushing products that don’t exist.  


Then theres the video that the CEO’s daughter made private this morning. This was a PR stunt, plain and simple. Having the Amazon logo appear next to the AG Eagle one intrinsically means nothing, but will get investors hyped and drive up the price.

Compare a previous UAVS press release to one of DECNS; they both mention that they are going to sell to large companies but never actually mention one by name. DECN just said that “several Fortune 500 companies have reached out to us” and UAVS said “a large company that already has a foundation in the drone delivery business”. These sentences are crafted to make investors think that they are partnering with a big company, but never explicitly stating it.

I tried my first penny stock test and sold uavs at a profit of. 35 a share. Could have made a lot more if I waited, but following the advice to temper expectations and go for 30% profits was awesome. I didn't win as big as I could have, but I am happy that I profited and feel that while I didn't win as big, a cautious approach means I won't lose as much, either. I made some money that I didn't have yesterday and for that I'm happy and excited for future opportunities ahead.

Retail took a **HUGE DUMP** late March, beginning of April.   It's gotta come back a bit.  Everyone got a $1200 check from Uncle Sam.  When the stores reopen people are gonna want to go buy shit.

I bought Tanger Outlets (SKT). Technically not a penny stocks now, but was when I nabbed it at $4.50

Reasoning... People are gonna want to buy shit. The ladies gonna want them Coach handbags. But, in tough times people go for bargains. Tanger is exclusively outlet malls.  

The big fish in the pond for retail REIT is Simon Properties (SPG).  Tanger just stole the CEO of Simon.  This is like being Shasta Cola and getting the CEO of Coke.

My guess (pure speculation) is there will be a buyout/merger.  Simon and Tanger already co-own a couple malls.",2020-04-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaek1n/retail_is_starting_to_slowly_rebound/

To top it all off, its one of the cleanest technical charts out there. Steady accumulation, and strong support rejecting short moves every time.

SEC 13D ! $6.25 MILLION MORE CASH AYTU !!! 

https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/aytu-bioscience-AYTU/stock-news/82341735/amended-statement-of-beneficial-ownership-sc-13d-a 

Beautiful ! 

Armistice Capital filed their FORM 13D Amended. They are OUT ! 

They exercised all their options at $1.25 each, 5 ma MILLION of them and now hold essentially NO more AYTU shares or warrants: 

$1.25 X 5,000,000 = $6,250,000 CASH into the balance sheet of AYTU 

AND the beauty of it is- they then SOLD ALL THOSE converted common shares (warrants exercised and then converted to common then sold SAME DAY - beautiful, single transaction, one fell swoop) and done on the run above $2 bucks with the MASSIVE VOLUME DAY so it barely made a dent in the share price. 

Armistice are DONE and OUT. Boyd as a board member timed it perfectly to do it when it would least impact the common share price - over $6 million more in cash added to the books, minimal impact and now OVER-HANG GONE and DONE ! 

AYTU is steadily getting rid of what is known as ""OVER HANG"" from their massive cash raise- the raise that has given them now more then $66 MILLION CASH ON HAND ($60 known million + new $6.25 million just raised) and getting it all behind them. 

This is GOOD LONG TERM- they are DEBT FREE, they bought TWO cash and earnings acredtive (additive) companies, they raised cash to buy COVID kits and commercialize Healight etc and are getting rid of all over-hang from those deals. 

Cerecor did the same- sold ALL THEIR LAST SHARES in the last approx 2 weeks, 9 million shares. That was part of the buy-out of their children's pharma line by AYTU end of 2019. They are now DONE and OUT and wanted to use cash for some drug they have in late phase clinical trials. 

So, DESPITE A DECENT NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES SOLD FOR CASH RAISING - the common share price has maintained a MASSIVE AND STEADY UP-TREND. 

LAST HOLDER = SAVVY. IF/When they get done and sell (they may hold long term) then this stock is going to FLY LIKE AN EAGLE as there will be ZERO over-hang left. No more shares left from the two buy-outs and/or the capital raises. 

Those firms exercised EVERY WARRANT THEY HAD - which means they saw a good deal in investing in AYTU. 

Again, the stock has shown AMAZING ABILITY to hold steady - while the final shares hit the market, shares used to MASSIVELY GROW THE COMPANY and enter untapped markets, gain a sales force of over 80, EIGHTY boots on the ground sales force and QUADRUPLE THEIR SALES - which is going to show on the next earnings, as coming from the 2 buy-out deals and all the new products they obtained - many of them FDA APPROVED and going from an approx sleepy $12 million annual top-line to now AT LEAST a $50 million annual top-line and by the qtr after that, with the test kit sales, EASILY a $100 million top-line ! 

LOOKING VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD HERE :) 

ONE last possible round of shares/warrants (Sabby) and DONE - cash loaded and free and clear to trade up w/ ZERO pressure from then on :) 

And it will be smaller than the Armistice round and we will FLY, as all over-hang will be done and gone. AMAZING STRENGTH from AYTU - and the shares were for GOOD PURPOSE, to raise LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH and use that cash for MASSIVE TOP-LINE REVENUE GROWTH IN A VERY, VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 

CASH RICH BALANCE SHEET NOW and DEBT FREE = WINNING FORMULA.

226,UAVS and sorting out fact from fiction,gaiq20,jus_in_bello,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaiq20/uavs_and_sorting_out_fact_from_fiction/,1,46,"Looking for some discussion.

There is a lot of hype, rumor, and speculation surrounding this stock, so much so that it went gangbusters today. For the people who made a lot of money, good on you. I sold early not believing the hype, then bought in at the end of the day.  However, I'm skeptical of this whole thing for reasons alluded to below.

AgEagle, founded in 2010, is a niche drone company specializing primarily in agriculture. They sell their drones all over the world to major farming corporations. They are a legitimate operation, but they have been a penny stock since they started trading. Recently, in 2018, they did a 1/25 reverse split, but ended up back in pennystock land. 

In September 2019, the company announced they were expanding into freight delivery to consumers, and had received an order for drones to do just that. After this announcement, their stock capped at about $0.40. On 4/15/2020, the company announced that it received additional purchase orders for commercial drones for package delivery, and hints that the order came from a major e-commerce company. That is all the information from the company itself. This PR was not about a new partnership, merger, or anything of the sort. Just a new order that would result in ""significant new revenue.""

On April 27, UAVS filed a Form S-3 for $6m in mixed share offerings. On the form, the  Proposed Maximum Offering Price Per Security is $0.58. (I'm a little confused as to what this means, but I thought I would add it here). 

This week the hype and speculation went wild - ""UAVS is partnering with Amazon. UAVS is being bought by Amazon. UAVS is selling drones to Amazon."" Today, this hype drove UAVS' stock to an AH, especially given that the company has a corporate update conference call for investors tomorrow morning (more on that in a moment). 

But what is really going on? No one knows for sure, at least nobody that would be reading this post. However, we can look at the verifiable clues to get an idea. 

First of all, there is nothing to indicate tomorrow's conference call is anything more than their routine conference calls. In fact, the company holds at least two a year, one around this time and one in the fall. Having said that, immediately after the 11/11/19 conference call, AgEagle announced a deal with the Florida Dept. of Agriculture. Likewise, after the 5/15/19 call, they released PR stating another so it had partnered with ""a major specialty crop producer"" in CA. So, it isn't a stretch to think that there isn't some news tied to Thursday's call. But there is nothing concrete, and news does not always follow their conference calls. 

Second, at first glance, it doesn't make sense that Amazon would be interested in AgEagle. Amazon has had its own drone division (Prime Air) since 2013, and has been designing and building their own drones. Amazon also has their own patents and proprietary software. So, what does AgEagle bring to the table, assuming the two companies are indeed connected? 

Best guesses: 

1) AgEagle has better proprietary technology? Maybe. AgEagle owns ParkView and HempOverView, both mapping systems, as well as other proprietary technology specific to agriculture. I won't pretend to understand the science. 

2) AgEagle has better drones? Doubtful. AgEagle's drones, at least the ones they have on their website (which is woefully outdated), are fixed wing, and would be unsuitable for urban delivery, IMO. There could be some hardware that Amazon is interested in. 

3) Amazon is expanding into Ag? Intriguing. Last year, Amazon was looking for an ""Agricultural Technical Professional"" for their AWS. Since Covid-19, direct farm-to-consumer sales have skyrocketed as people are avoiding grocery stores. Amazon, likewise, has also seen an uptick in their online grocery. I'm not sure if or how these fit into the puzzle, but it is interesting. Hemp and Marijuana are huge businesses, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that Amazon would be looking at that sector. Timing is suspect though. 

Of course, I have no idea why or if Amazon is interested in AgEagle, but rumor is that is the case. In support of the rumor, earlier today there was a video circulating, ostensibly made by the daughter of Bret Chilcott, the founder of AgEagle, that showed AgEagle and Amazon's logo today, as if in partnership. The content of the video looked to be instructions of either boxing or unboxing of a drone. There were other potential clues posted on twitter and reddit, though I won't get into them. 

TL;DR - Nothing about this makes sense, I have no idea what's going on, a lot of people made money today.",2020-04-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaiq20/uavs_and_sorting_out_fact_from_fiction/

[Chart 2 RobinTrack Supply/Demand](https://ibb.co/fGLDWSj) 

[Chart 3 Oversold Proof / HODL](https://ibb.co/PwHbrnT)

So much to say about this. Plenty of room for open opportunity to get into. Highly affordable, support has been consistent at 0.25, broke resistance near closing, and after-hours (0.31). The chart has a gap chance for 0.80+. I'd love to truly be intrigued to get into asap confidently to measure a nova breakout around 0.48. Examining the candles on the left chart, we see a high rise of interest peaking since we all know at this point oil/gas is on the rise for demand eventually should the economy re-open again to its normal flow. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is TTI? 

An oil &amp; gas company that focuses on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, producting well testing, production, offshore rig cooling, &amp; compression services and equipment. 

What's their future? Risk of de-list?

Interestingly enough, the NYSE is being generous extending their continuation multiple times, so I don't see these guys going anywhere. 

Legit company? 

Yes, though slightly struggling they're a renowned necessity as a global business and address/company contact seems to be legit upon doing a little research.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

At one point, EPS was consistent on the rise for four quarters.

Cheap.

PB: 1.06 again, another perfect analyst intriguing ratio in trader's eyes.

PE -0.27 (just about right which is a perfect signal for entry).

Oversold.

Refuses to drop bellow 0.25 (support).

Cons:

Q1 2020 resulted in dagger fall in the chart. However, this leads to an open opportunity for a swing trade. 

Debt to asset ratio of 87.20% though not horrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best entry? 0.30 to 0.25.

Long term or short? Still under observation.

I think that is a good (short term) trade. The factors that move its price are quite straightforward and oil stocks are very hot right now as they recently hit a pretty hard bottom.

No clue which side would be considered  left or right, but it seems like a lot of people can't be swayed from their stance. Whether it's all in or all against..

My question is for the independents... What's your next buy target?  If no new press over next few days I feel like $1.40 is a good target. Figure 20% of what I'm willing to commit, then next 20% for every nickel to keep averaging down.

I don't see the heal light generating much buzz other than small jumps when press hits, but nothing huge until they release news on human trials starting, assuming they get to that point. (For the record I hope it becomes the next amazing medical device and I'm ok missing out on a massive run)

So I'm looking at the next bump from the 500k tests reporting that they arrived. Figure then target of $1.70 to sell 20% of shares I obtained then every 10 cents run up.

This stock seems to have regained it's consistency again and keeps giving nice pops of profit.  I like that it's slower and suits swing trades better since I don't have time to watch like a day trader would.

Pre-Covid price was $1.15. 52 week high is $3.93 sometime last summer. Precipitous decline from August 2019 to October 2019 due to supply chain issues.

274,UAV and Amazon Agreement (cont.),gag49e,575MV12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gag49e/uav_and_amazon_agreement_cont/,1,75,"

Just so everyone knows, the only reason I told you about UAVS and Amazon, confirming it, is because I know the struggle of trying to get money from stocks. Some of us are great, others aren’t, so this is like a head-start. In these times, we need to help one-another. 

Some may doubt this post, thinking it’s a lie, but it really isn’t. If you don’t believe me, I do understand. However, I would not risk other people’s hundreds of thousands of dollars, because I know the struggle it takes and the hardships one endured to make it, especially knowing “what if it doesn’t work out.”

I cannot confirm how much the stock will increase after the Amazon and UAV announcement, but I can confirm that they are announcing their partnership tomorrow morning at 11:00am. 

If you need to see my stake in this, check my recent posts.
