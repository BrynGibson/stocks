38,youdonthavetowipe,fni1i4i,/r/pennystocks/comments/g1tnsc/tim_sykes/fni1i4i/,2,"This isn't exactly true. The interesting thing about Timothy Sykes is that he does start with a small amount every year, something like an initial $10,000 investment at the beginning of the calendar year so his students learn how to grow their portfolio from that amount. His entire program is pretty spendy and I do admit set the chat room is mainly just an alarm for when he makes a trade and it's full of other wannabes that follow what he does, never admitting that they're probably not privy to the actual information that garners Sykes the most money. Not to mention he probably games quite a bit off of the waves that he creates in the market...  But the point of it is to learn how to actually set rules for yourself and make small percentage-based trades, no long holds, no pie in the sky hopes, no crazy hail marys. Just learning how to watch for the right indicators and plays that regularly shoot for somewhere between 5-10-15% that will add up over time. I think the reason that people here don't like him is that he actually has a method and rules instead of just going on intuition. If everybody here had the ability to hold themselves accountable by getting out of a stock at a 5 to 10% loss instead of holding, there would be a lot more happy people in the sub. If you think about it, you're odds of hitting the big one are garbage compared to hitting a lot of small ones and that's the key reason that Sykes method works for people. If you put 10k on the line to make 10% regularly, or even 5%, that's going to add up a lot more than hoping 1k will double or even triple.  Not saying I love the guy, Sykes is a total d-bag, but not everything he says is total bs.",2020-04-15

I knew it wasn’t going to work out for me to buy unless I made a limit order above the next halt but even then it looked risky considering the halts. 

Good for the people that were able to sell but sucks for everyone that made a limit order around the 113 range and the stock dipped. I saw orders go through around that range on Robinhood level 2. Damn",2020-04-15

But my observation is if the stock price is rallying upwards real fast at the ""beginning of the day"", it usually lasts atleast until noon then probably might come down so you sell. So yes you can setup 10% stop loss to be safe.

But there is a catch here, you can do such day trades only 4 times in 5 days if you have a margin account, if you keep doing this you will be marked as a Pattern Day trader.

Pattern day trader is a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) designation for a stock market trader who executes four or more day trades in five business days in a margin account, provided the number of day trades are more than six percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day period.A FINRA rule applies to any customer who buys and sells a particular security in the same trading day (day trades), and does this four or more times in any five consecutive business day period; the rule applies to margin accounts, but not to cash accounts.  A pattern day trader is subject to special rules. The main rule is that in order to engage in pattern day trading you must maintain an equity balance of at least $25,000 in a margin account. The required minimum equity must be in the account prior to any day trading activities.

well form the looks of that statement it is a reverse stock split which means they are consolidating shares? So I would say you now own only 700 shares??

I'm not really well versed in this yet so hopefully someone can confirm?

&amp;#x200B;

From Google \]

In finance, a **reverse stock split** or **reverse split** is a process by which shares of corporate **stock** are effectively merged to form a smaller number of proportionally more valuable shares. A **reverse stock split** is also called a **stock** merge.

so yeah looks like you only own 700 shares now {hope I was helpful}

Not remotely what it says. It says it doesn't work for checking IMMUNITY. Reading comprehension is important.

&gt;""""First, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules, and now companies can sell antibody tests without submitting validation data that shows they actually work. 

This is also not correct or at the very least misleading. The tests still have to be approved. A company cant just sell a bogus test. It theoretically still has to work.

&gt;""It's like the wild, wild West out there -- or wild East,"" said association CEO Scott Becker, a reference to the fact that at least half the companies making these tests are in China.""""""

This seems to be a reference to counterfeiting and the lack of proper policing. But uh... welcome to counterfeiting? Something that hampers EVERY industry?

DECN is working on a blood test but also other tests. Also just to further emphasize that blood testing can work:

Also, if company A has huge news that just dropped and I post it while it has a 10 percent gain, wouldn't you want to know so you can ride it for another 10-20% gain? It's not like it's going to raise one cent and then everyone in the financial world decides it has already gone up so it's done moving and bails.

You may want to reevaluate your strategy if you actually ignore upward trends when they just start.

Example: people posted SONN in the 5s and 6s. I'm sure going back you would have gladly scooped it up that day in the 5s and 6s.",2020-04-15

We're still waiting to hear for distribution partnership, as well as pre EUA for the at-home kits. Those will be big news.

Then, obviously, we're waiting for EUA granting for the POC kits.

With EUA, the FDA will update their website to add them to the list, so that could happen literally any second, to a week from now.

However, FDA seemed very eager to get the ball rolling for decn genviro EUA, so hopefully sooner than later.

The world needs as many tests as it can get right now, so they're probably working double time.

Also important to note is that there's just a constant river of people buying in right now, which means this stock is on a shit ton of watch lists.... 

So any of the announcements out of the list of announcements we're waiting for will likely result in a large spike in the stock price.

761,S_A_N_D_,fni3ry9,/r/pennystocks/comments/g1rvdg/ogen_failed_trials/fni3ry9/,6,"I think this highlights a difference between two different types of stock posted here. Stocks like ATYU and IBIO are quite obviously pump and dumps. They have almost no chance of ever becoming a big player in the short term and very limited chance of becoming one in the long run. Any jump will simply be based only on hype. (For others who might try and come to their rescue, please don't reply to this to defend either company. I'm a molecular biologist and I've done my own DD on these companies. I have spoken out about them in the relevant posts as they came up. I stand by my statement and I'm not here to go off topic and debate them). 

OGEN, on the other hand, seems like a legit company. Having looked into them, they seem at least on the level and the research seems promising. What most people fail to realize however since they don't work in the field is that most drugs fail and a good portion of those failures happen once they hit trials. There is a huge difference between *in vitro* and mouse models.  Furthermore, they not only need to be effective, they need to be either more effective than the current treatments, or as effective with fewer side effects. Simply being effective doesn't mean you can sell it if there is no upside over current treatments. 

OGEN is a great example of how even the best DD can't give you insight into whether a drug will pass trials. If it could, than there would be no reason to do the trials. A legit company that has a drug in trials is still a risk and they are penny stocks for a reason. The chance that they'll succeed is still quite low. If they were a sure thing it would either already be priced into the stock, they would be privately funded (and wouldn't be publicly traded), or more likely they would be snatched up by a large pharmaceutical company.",2020-04-15

It’s priming for a breakout on the technicals, but fundamentally it is wholly dependent on FDA approval.  It’s a pure speculation play so set a stop loss at a percentage you’re willing to lose if it gets denied and the stock takes a huge steaming dump.  If FDA approval then it has room to grow to $1, maybe more of their 2nd Covid test eventually gets approved.  Resistance at .23, .25 and .29. Support at .19.

They've been in business for 18 years and already sell their FDA approved products on Amazon and Walmart. Because of this some of us are confident they will get FDA approved and have invested a few thousand into this stock. 

You're gambling either way with this stock but I feel our odds are better than 50/50. More like 85/15. I see them getting fda approved. I'm confident in that. I am not confident in how far the stock will go though.  Atleast $1 but how much more than that?",2020-04-15

As I understand it crypto has fewer variables that contribute to it's value, which I imagine makes technical analysis more consequential. Nobody knows what the hell is going to happen with a company. The landlord the company rents office space from could've formed a tax haven and gotten caught, the government coming in and freezing all their assets, forcing the company to vacate and take on a new lease, substantially lowering shareholder value for a couple quarters.

A more present concern is hype. AYTU got recognition on sites like this and suddenly people are hanging onto it for dear life hoping to god it keeps going. If you'd invested in weed stocks back in 2016 you would've been a real happy camper, but people got too excited by the boom and forgot that the legal framework in Canada and the U.S. is still pretty shabby, so people expecting the 'new gold-rush' got pissed and left. Now this isn't even close to the only factor, and that's the point. Investors in equity move on momentum, whether it be a good earnings report or a new product release. I would focus on the leadership and the direction of the company for real long-term results, call me old-fashioned. You CAN capitalize on hype though, given you have enough data accumulated to make certain predictions. I've been investigating ways to research google search hits for specific terms like 'AYTU' and if there's a correlation to stock price. Amazon's motto has always been 'the company with the most data wins'.

A good example of this what I predicted would happen to Tesla after that sharp dip it took about a year ago. It had gotten a few bad news stories about batteries setting on fire (after being run past their limits in extreme conditions) and analysts were taking a piss like they always do, but I knew a few things. Firstly Tesla's opening factories in China which means they'll be populating an electric car market that *dwarfs* the US EV market. China actually penalizes you by law for having a gas car - they hope to do away with them entirely in the coming years. This means Tesla's getting directly involved in that market but ALSO that their cost of goods for their American sales will go way down, given that a great deal of their manufacturing will likely be moved over to China and then shipped overseas to retailers for pennies on the dollar like every other manufacturer. Plus, they're trying to cut ties with Panasonic and build their own batteries. They're fundamentally a good investment.

TL:DR, I knew Tesla was going to come back, so I bought in at 180 and sold at 500. Now if you know how high it ended up going, you'll laugh your ass off at me. I set a sell price I thought was reasonable and left it at that. Frankly, I think the company's overvalued right now, but who cares.

stock market prices are stupid because millions of people are scrambling around like fish looking for bait. If you do research expecting to find a specific answer, that's the answer you'll come up with whether it's supported or not.",2020-04-15

i actually added another 1000 shares earlier today at .44.

But if you want my honest opinion to me i am downgrading it to a Hold and not a buy.

I firmly think we will see 40 cents or less on it in the next week or 2 maybe even mid 30s.

Oil is steadily dropping a little more day by day and demand is much weaker then i expected.

I also think we are going to run out of room to store oil alot more quicker then i thought causing oil prices to get worse in the next month.

Like i said i have a big position in it but at this point i am not buying more and i am holding. 

I am long on this stock and bought it with intentions of a 12 month + hold.

But if you want my honest opinion i wouldnt be buying it right now as i fear it will go lower.

I personally have started buying oil tanker stocks the past few days.

I made a post about one of them and jumped on it early today.

With all the oil being produced and little demand all these places are gong to need a place to store it and oil tanker stocks are where it is at.

The stock i made a post about the other day is TNP.

I picked it up earlier today for $2.59 a share and its showing currently sitting at $2.98 after hours.

I think it has a lot of room to move.

kinda like playing both sides of the field right now",2020-04-15

They had a reverse 5 to 1 split before the crash.. if the company had not re-branded did not go ahead with the reverse 5 to 1, analysts would be going on and on about how Encana is at an all time low and might have a positive long term outlook etc etc. I think OVV is a victim of poor timing more than anything else. When Encana hit a low in 2016 that was around 4$.. or 20$ (in OVV pricing with 5to1) I find it hard to believe that anything is priced in at this point other than bankruptcy with the stock sitting around 5$ ($1 Encana pricing)   Sorry to keep referring back to Encanas price I just think that adds some context and I believe that split did them a great deal of harm in adding confusion to traders right as the covid pandemic started.
