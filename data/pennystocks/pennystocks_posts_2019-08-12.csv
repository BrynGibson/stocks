My uncle got phished (his fault, totally) but now that opens the door to potential cybersecurity threats to me since we communicate so frequently. 


I feel like the fact that I use my personal computer for trading could put me at an additional risk for being targeted. I think the risk varies based on where (platform, or web browser) I execute the trades. 

Are there any precautions I should take? I literally know nothing about cybersecurity",2019-08-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpcvqw/what_security_precautions_do_you_take_when/

11,TRNX,cpdeyp,esoteric82,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpdeyp/trnx/,4,24,"This has a nice pump today. However just did some quick research on the Taronis Fuels 1:1 ""dividend."" Per Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/taronis-fuels-dividend-record-date-130000862.html), even though the ex-date for the dividend is 8/15, in order to receive the shares, shareholders must actually hold the shares until the distribution on 9/1. I haven't seen this before.

In another post, I shared according to the proxy voting, TRNX is planning to conduct a reverse split effective 8/22 (I believe) if shr shareholders vote to approve (I voted against). Meaning, in order to obtain the Taronis Fuels shares, current TRNX holders may have to pay the price of a R/S.

What does everyone think? This reeks of sneakiness to me.",2019-08-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpdeyp/trnx/

Hopped up but then went down the next day, I forget the % but it was down 4$ at .27 per share so I sold them all, then bought 60 shares at .32 just to see what happens....Hit +61% today which probably would've made the total over $100, instead it's $19 to $31.  -.-  There's my first lesson!

As far as I know, $MSFT’s Hololens which probably won’t be sold in stores until next year.
