(Up $4,325 in a months time)",9yb94f,Jayywise,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9yb94f/trading_account_update_and_comparison_up_4325_in/,5,55,"  I first started trading on my own with around $650 and blew up my first account within the first week. I used StockTwits a lot for trade ideas which ended up in me chasing overhyped stocks and listening to unrealistic price targets from other users. I do not recommend anyone starting out to use or download StockTwits lol. 

 ———— Update: 11/18   After changing some habits and reloading my RH account- I am now up $4,325 in a months time (Thanks to the chatroom and Twitter!)  I stopped using StockTwits and started to use Twitter more for a community of traders. I also went and found some trading chatrooms that have been a great help and is making me become a better trader and learn with other individuals.  

Drop comment or pm for chatroom link!

3,Work WITH your penny stock!,9y8231,justbeaguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9y8231/work_with_your_penny_stock/,1,47,"How many of you work WITH your penny stocks?


I'm invested and try to work with 3:


Drone delivery Canada (FLT:CA) - I do my own research and I make others aware of the technological advances that they are working on. I present benefits to the industry and how this can help their company save money and expand their businesses in the future. The more knowledge I share the better it is for the company.

ParcelPal (PKG:CA) - I strongly believe this is the Uber of delivery and will take over the market. Not only do they have a deal with Amazon in place but they are continuing to expand in Canada. As soon as they are operating in my area I will go get custom parcelpal t-shirts and hats made, dress up, and will literally work as a parcelpal delivery agent. I will offer the best customer service possible and will tell people about the investment opportunities because I want it to grow.


Global Hemp Group (GHG:CA) - they're not your typical hemp group as they are focusing on all other aspects of the plant. they are aligned with hempsmart In America which works as a network marketing company similar to isagenix and doTERRA. I'm trying to bring awareness to all the good that they do on social media, and it is very likely I will be a network marketing salesperson for hempsmart in hopes of a growing along with GHG.

any dollar I make above my means of living I invest in these companies.

on top of that I keep my eyes peeled to employment opportunities within their companies. I willing to relocate and help the cause at minimum wage just to see it grow.

in my opinion this is how you build a penny stock into a winner.

Does anyone else here do that? If so tell me your story and who you invest in so I can invest in you too.",2018-11-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9y8231/work_with_your_penny_stock/
