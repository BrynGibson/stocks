If there's no news but there is significantly more volume and the stock is going up/flat, I expect news soon.

I agree with the above that they are a good acquisition target but I think the value lies in the absolutely massive amount of data they have and have been collecting on people. No other company has sleep and heart data like Fitbit has and if they can monotone that they will have huge revenue streams. On top of that if they can get FDA cleared as a medical device in the future they can make some sort of deal with insurance companies I.e. wear a Fitbit get a lower insurance rate kinda thing. I’m gonna keep holding and thinking of adding to my position. ,2019-01-09

Best app. Just bought the versa. 5 day battery life vs Apple 4 with 18 hours. I want to monitor sleep time and heart rate so it’s and easy choice.

They are competitive and need to do what they need to do to make their goals. Some people can’t handle the cutthroats mentality of businesses like this. Thanks for turning my head to this company.
