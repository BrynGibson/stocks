Also if you see an entire sector just start to go off.  Find ones that haven't really popped yet.  Play for flip.  It was like this last week in December with the pot stocks and mid December with the Bitcoin associated stocks.

If you mean a situation where you would “short a stock” then absolutely, if you have knowledge or think the stock is overvalued shorting the stock will give you the inverse gains of having bought the securities long, should it drop.

106,HuXu7,dsdaan3,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ogi32/how_to_know_if_its_scam/dsdaan3/,1,"All stock trading can be seen as gambling as you are making a bet on the future pay out.  You don't know how much you will make but you make a guess.  Plenty of people make a living and a good living doing day trading, some days they don't many any money, some days they lose money, but most days they make money and thats what matters.

There are tons of strategies out there and its important to not get cocky or greedy, you figure out a strategy actually define a good buy and sell price and you will mostly come out winning.  Always review your losses to see what you did in your decision making process to hopefully turn that loss around.

The problem is people get into this buying whenever and then hoping for a huge 100% jump and then selling but many get into this gamblers mindset where if a stock hits 100% they think ""maybe I should hold more, could it hit 200%?"" but then it tanks and they lose the 100% where if they set their limits they could have jumped out with 100% and been good.

It's not 100% luck like scratch tickets, there is some strategy, there are patterns, its like if you knew every 5 - 8 scratch tickets was a winner for a specific type of scratch ticket so you would want to figure out the pattern and then buy every 5 - 8 tickets that are sold to get a good winner.  Still a risk that the manufacturer changes the pattern and then you would start losing but there are patterns and they can help you invest wisely to where you come out on top every time.  Never guaranteed but the likelyhood is high.",2018-01-06

I wouldn't go more than 3,000, and if you do go more than 2-3,000 I would set a higher stop loss at around .97-.98. Do not set stop loss above $1, easily one of the safest swing charts I've ever seen, and this stock has an insane bottom at 1.03/.4. 


It all depends how much funds you're rocking though. If you have 60k+ you can easily buy 10k shares with very little downside. If you only have a few grand or a couple hundred you can definitely YOLO half your funds on this one with a safe stop loss. I'm personally YOLOing this one with a little IDXG.
