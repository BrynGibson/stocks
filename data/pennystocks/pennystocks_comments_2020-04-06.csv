21,Knight_Aero,fmjzo30,/r/pennystocks/comments/fvqgzg/imimf_your_opinion/fmjzo30/,1,I bought it around .33 weeks ago since I knew they were acquiring some new land for mining potential. Looks very promising and we could see good news this Tuesday at a meeting they are having. The big news will come at the end of the month or early next when they reveal the results of the land survey. If its promising the bump should be decent. When they begin mining officially though I think is when things may really roll. I'll be happy if they crest over a dollar at some point in the next few months. I thing some gold mining stocks have seen this easily if the market calls for it. This is definitely a long watch though if you don't mind the higher fee per trade and the waiting.

This will tie up your capital, providing up front credit, and you make money so long as the stocks don't go up, if you do it right. I'll give an example. 

Just checked and there's 4/17 22/24 for delta, max risk $102, max profit starting below $22/share is $98. So they're currently below $20 a share, so basically +50% on your money if they don't go up 10% in two weeks, for max profit, 15% to break even, or 20% to lose $102.

This ties up $200 for collateral, but you get $98 back immediately, which is free to use. Just remember you can lose all $200, as well as the $98 if you lose the $98 somewhere else, and the stock shoots up over $24.",2020-04-06

When I first got interesting in stock trading I visited this sub-reddit and r/stocks and saw posts about AYTU being the hot thing to invest in so I hurried up and made a Robinhood account, invested $100 and saw that it was actually making profit so I went ahead and dumped another $900 into that stock. Well, I eventually saw $400 profit but I didn't sell cause I thought it would go even higher, next thing I know less than a week later I'm selling all my AYTU shares for a $250 loss.

I should of gotten a stock simulator and played with fake money while also doing my own DD by educating myself. But here we are now. $450 gone and hoping for DECN to be my knight in shining armor.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sat some hard rules for myself though..

1. I will no longer invest into anymore stocks until I sell DECN
2. I will no longer use more than $500 at any time to invest.
3. I will begin to educate myself better (currently watching WarriorTrading youtube channel)
4. I will accept the **profit is profit** philosophy and cash out when I feel the profit is reasonable enough (15-25% in profit seems reasonable)  instead of holding on to my shares for longer in fear of missing out on more profit (this is what my AYTU loss taught me).

More rules once I educate myself more and learn more lessons. Unfortunately, I shouldn't of had to lose $450 to learn these lessons. I do have an ok career so the money I have loss does not affect my quality of life outside of the mental pain that comes with knowing I lost $450. I can still afford my rent, food, bills, put money into savings + even put some into investing but I will not.",2020-04-06

People are scared and depressed so they're looking for any excuse to say it'll end next month. Think about the millions who are gonna be forcibly unemployed for the foreseeable future, then think about the majority of middle and lower class workers who are going into financial hibernation. Spending is down, buying power is down. Everything's being held underwater until a viable vaccine is synthesized. Eject now and wait, it's better to have everything liquid in case you have to pay $3000+ for a test to find out if you have a 'preexisting condition' your insurance won't cover.

\- Acquired Thane property in British Columbia (Results of deposits found in the ground will be released in the coming weeks).

\- Acquired Cathedral property, over 200 squared km of land, and contains rocks found in other places that are known for containing large deposits of both gold and copper.

\- Actual drilling is to begin in Fall 2020. (I personally am not sure for which property).

\- Coronavirus will not have a large impact on the company as they are considered an ""essential company.""

\- CEO, along with many others on the IMC board, have many years of experience in this industry and have worked on the boards of many other companies in this field.

\- Ambitions to spread throughout North and South America
