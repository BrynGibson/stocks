I check volume as I buy and sell. 

This morning the volume dropped and by afternoon it went back up.

So far, the 2 past weeks or so I've noticed this:  volume at 20mil and goes up to 50, and once it goes to 80 that's when posts appear about SHIP and TOPS. Once the volume reaches 110mil to 125mil, it goes back down to 20mil. It's a pnd.

It hovers around .28 and .29 without momentum to break.

I say this as I hold until it does bc even though I think its pnd, it still has potential in the coming days.

As I’m sure you know, stocks suddenly get a little volatile all the time, it’s best to know the potential volatility of the stock you’re trading to account for potential jumps like that.
Beyond that you could look into it to see if any of the Trading platforms have a stop loss parameter for if price goes below X for X minutes then sell. But even if that was possible you would be opening yourself up to it falling even lower within that time limit.",2020-04-22

474,Plagrea,fo8fher,/r/pennystocks/comments/g65pzx/can_we_please_refrain_from_commenting_on_stocks/fo8fher/,1,"For me I think the difference is obvious between people who have some idea of what they're saying, and people who did a five-minute drive-thru DD and act like they know something. 

The key here is that, in the end, you don't *need* to invest. You could just park your money in an interest bearing account. We're all inherently taking on risk, the only real difference is how *much*. So if somebody wants to call a stock a pump and dump, I think that's fine because anybody who has a decent head on their shoulders will recognize that there's no way to really qualify a pump and dump. The company itself can act in bad faith (which is simply referred to as fraud) or there can be a big hype bubble based on some crackpot theory of skyrocketing profitability, but everybody knows that's not how companies work the vast majority of the time; and that's not how investment works either. So 'pump and dump' doesn't really mean anything, it's the equivalent of somebody calling a video 'fake and gay'.

Here's the thing. You don't \*want\* short-term investors in your stock. You want people who've done their DD and won't scamper at the first sign of trouble because the fundamental value of the stock; the company's products, value in the market, and leadership, don't change because of a rough quarter. I think you should see hype traders running away from your stock because of negative comments as a good thing. They weren't going to stay long anyway.",2020-04-22

I’m in med device...just starting to look at this, because I’m looking for my next short term stock play.  

Just my opinion, but the first sentence in the quote indicates delays of some sort.  Tbh, I haven’t researched enough to have an idea of what those delays might be with this company.  It seems it would either be something that would delay EUA from the FDA or concerns with their manufacturing scalability if EUA goes through.  The latter could be tied to financial challenges.  Can’t access their balance sheet on Yahoo, but I do see the negative cash flow.  Seems like financial issues could be resolved by a big government order, though, if they really have a winner.  

The release did say they would be talking, “longer than usual”, which I’m not sure what usual is for them.  They will likely cover their issues but will spend a fair amount of time to try and ensure that confidence isn’t lost over whatever issues they present. 

It’s an interesting play...not sure which side I fall on yet...",2020-04-22

He tells you that you can use his but prefers you learn how to find your own. But what happens once you find your own?? Do you know what to do with it?? Tim can help you with that too. A lot of guys like to bash him. One set of guys are just born with the right genes. They understand the market like Neo in the matrix. They are just highly intelligent highly functional people that walk through some things in life with ease. These guys don’t understand how everyone doesn’t see how easy it all is. Other guys have put in all the long and hard work for years and are finally profitable and think everyone should gruel it out on their own while trying to feel their way around in the dark. So they bash Tim. Some guys bash Tim because others bash tim and it makes them feel tough like a dude with a fake twitter handle. Here’s the deal. Tim is not the best trader out there and admits as much. He pushes a lot of material because it makes him tons of money and he likes what he does. You don’t need everything Tim puts out. But if you are trying to learn his bread and butter on trading he can help you lay a foundation on the basics that you can learn in a 30hr course for a few hundred bucks verses years of studying and loosing money. I taught myself how to trade long term stocks and have done fairly well, but it’s slow money. Day trading (fast money) was kicking my tail so I watched Tim’s how to make millions and now I’m profitable on 70-80% of my trades. And my losses are minimal because I cut losses before I get in to deep Tim’s foundation material did not make me millions but it did help me get past months or years of trial and error and I’m profitable. I get his watch list and sometimes don’t look at it for days. Often times I find he didn’t trad anything I did and sometimes we both traded the same stocks. He helped me find the right ones to look at and what to do once I found them. Don’t go overboard with all his stuff. A lot of it is repetitive but most is helpful. One or two of his video seminars will cover pretty much all he’s got. I have friends that lay for the full subscription and use the active message board. They have got some good info there at times and had their ass handed to them other times. So I would be careful relying on any message board. I trade what the chart tells me not some message board full of gamblers. Hope this helps",2020-04-22

As I mentioned in my post, we have no details on this company's capacity to actually get these kits in the market and sell them.

To summarize as succinctly as possible:

What happened is oil futures for MAY went negative, meaning since there is NO demand right now and too much supply it is actually a waste of money to store the oil, what basically happened was people saw the writing on the wall, realizing there wasn’t storage capacity for WTI and flipped out. This caused the price to go negative, which represents the money it would cost to essentially store the oil.

Now the reason why oil co stocks are up? Because BRENT crude and other types of oil didn’t go negative. WTI is Land-locked, storage is harder. Brent and the others might not have these challenges. If oil futures for May are down, but increase in June and July, what that basically says is that people buying these futures are speculating that demand for oil will increase past the month of May, basically giving continued value to oil companies.

It should be noted though that so many of these companies are leveraged beyond belief. Whiting already went bust. CHK will probably go bust too. Occidental petroleum should be bankrupt by now (39billion in debt), but they have Warren on their side. 

The industry as a whole is getting pillaged right now, the super majors (XOM, Chevron, TOTAL, etc etc) can make money at many prices of oil because they have Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream segments.",2020-04-22

Think about this, this stock has risen 12 cents a share in a day because they released an announcement saying they are having an announcement Thursday. Just imagine how much it’ll skyrocket once actual good news is released! 

Once this thing gets approved, which I think of will very shortly, and orders start coming in, the PPS will have a floor of $1.00. I truly believe that

Don’t get me wrong, people will have stop limits at .35, .40,.60 ...etc which Is great if you wanna secure some profits in the short term, and you may see the price do some short declines, but investors will eat up those low shares and propel this forward. Secure some profits if you want, but as a long term hold this stock can really go high and holding this share will earn you more money in the long run.

Don't listen to the people saying it's going to X dollars.  Expect a nice .10-.20 cent bump and put a stop loss in.  If it keeps going up.  Increase your stop loss, or use a trailing stop loss.

Stop loss = if the stock falls to a set price (you pick) trigger a sell

When you begin your search on Google, are you reading articles and researching companies? What I've done so far is review articles to read on penny stocks and basically learning what they are. It's all sort of broad to me and gambling almost, but for example, do you find a company that peaks your interest, then research on it? And if you do, what can you learn about the company? I.E. Mergers, etc.? I hope you don't mind me asking, I'm learning along the way as I invest in other shares, the mergers is one that I've learned recently with MVIS. 

I appreciate your help and understand that you're not obligated to answer either, so no hurt there. It's a lot of info and I don't want it to seem unfair or unkind of me asking; thank you very much nevertheless!",2020-04-22

Google the basics and how the stock market works.  Familiarise yourself with the terminology.  Look up how to read a candlestick chart, and what metrics are useful for guessing what the stock is going to do, and which ones are just noise.  People usually use 2-3 in combination with each other on their charts.  Others use about 20 and are autistic.  Definitely look up RSI and moving averages.

Learning how to use a screener is handy for finding new stocks.  Volume is is a big thing to keep an eye on.  But I basically use reddit, stocktwits and the news to find which ones are starting to get hyped up and why, decide if its the beginning of the pump or the end, then try and grab a nice entry price.  Hopefully get myself out before the dump.  Even if it doesn't dump after you sell, PROFITS = PROFITS 

News to look for would be upcoming earnings reports, mergers, SEC filings, new products in the pipeline, possible FDA approvals, or world events that might benefit their industry.  I also follow the stocks on twitter that I plan on holding for more than a day or two.  They like to tweet instead of release PR (see MARK).

p.s. if someone tells you to go do your DD, it means due diligence.",2020-04-22

I'm saving this comment and I'll do my research on some of the terms here as well as following your advice. The following points are for my notes:

Thank you very much for the advice!

* Google basics of how the stock market functions; understand the terminology
* Understand candlestick charts and learn what metrics are useful for predicting trends or just noise. Use 2-3 and look up RSI and moving average *(define)*
* Learn about **screeners** to find new stocks; volume is a big thing to keep an eye on (you could use Reddit, Stocktwits, &amp; the news to see which ones are getting all the hype and why, decide if it's the beginning or the end of the pump, ""then try and grab a nice entry price"")
* Get out before the dump; PROFITS = PROFITS
* News to look for: upcoming earning reports, mergers, SEC filings *(define)*, new products in the pipeline *(wdym)*, possible FDA approvals **(U.S)**, or world events that may benefit their industry. 
* Follow stocks on twitter (that you may plan on holding for a day or two); they like to tweet instead of run PRs (See MARK) *(define)*
* DD Means Due Diligence *(define)*",2020-04-22

To clarify the pipeline comment, it refers to products in development.  Like a pharmaceutical company working on a new treatment/vaccine, or a tech company working on new software or tech.

Another good tip is too take what you think you've learned and see if you can apply it to stocks that have had success.  When did it go up? Why? When did it drop? Why? That way you can keep on eye out for it in real time to evaluate your possible trades.

Good luck!  May the God of Tendies look upon you favorably.",2020-04-22
