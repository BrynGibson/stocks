3,$PT (Pintec Technology Holdings Limited) - Equity 5 times less than Mkt cap.,e7yqq9,christoffer1917,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e7yqq9/pt_pintec_technology_holdings_limited_equity_5/,1,2,"The chinese fintech solutions provider, Pintec, is atm trading for 0,9001 dollars, originating a market Cap of 34,152M USD. 
Looking through their previous financial results for six month ended as of June 30th, 2019, one will find that the company currently hold assets with a worth of 377,806K whilst only being liable to 208,414K woth of debt. This means that the company has equity of 169,391K or about 169M.
As I stated in the title, that means that the Mkt Cap represents a fifth of the value of Pintec's underlying worth.
One can look further into the company and find that it holds value even greater than it's assets. It has state of the art technology (SaaS Plus) and has partners such as Xiaomu, Ctrip and Vip.com as well as only recently having partnered with ICBC.
After issuing an SEC 6-K form on 29th of november, stating the joint venture between Pintec and the ""Yinchuan Fund"", to form the entity of Pintec Yinchuan, the stock quickly increased above 50%, but has since slowly fallen back down.

I can strongly recommend anyone having read this to purchase this stock, or even just looking through their previous financial results.
