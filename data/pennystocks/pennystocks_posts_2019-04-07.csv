I hold a very small stake but am interested in the reverse merger, obviously, because this merging entity is said to have a cap of 50million. LEAS cap is 2M, so people suspect the price to rise from 0.002 to 0.05. I'd like to know your opinions. I've tried to provide news and not opinion but please do your DD.

8,$VLT gains +145% | $YRIV $AVEO lawsuits | $OPTT $PSTI drop explained,bai8n5,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bai8n5/vlt_gains_145_yriv_aveo_lawsuits_optt_psti_drop/,10,72,"As mentioned in the last week's post micro and nano-cap stocks produce less big runners. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only real strong runner we saw was $VTL. The stock jumped +145% and held the gains pretty well till the end of the trading day. In after hours trading, the stock price did not slide down but I would not be amazed if on Monday stock would drop as it is usual price action to these nano and micro-cap stocks.

$VTL did make a move which was possible to day trade and few features always can tell you if you can expect a big price increase in penny stock. The stock is real nano-cap stock with a market cap under 50 million. This is one of the feature of a penny stock runner. Next, we saw a big volume (&gt; 6million share volume in 10 minutes) and volatility (&gt;25% in 10minutes) after the market opened on Friday. That is a few telltale signs for a possible price increase in nano-cap stock. 

&amp;#x200B;

$YRIV &amp; $AVEO stocks have a huge following from the general public (according to Google searches and ST) and it is a very strange thing for me to see while the litigation and class action lawsuits are noticeable and continue for some time now. When looking at the news timeline on Finviz you cannot see anything good only that investors and law firms are suing the companies. Even scarier is that there are multiple law firms and investors going after the companies which show that this is not just one angry investor that accidentally lost with a company.  I am curious if people still considering to invest in these stocks and if they do this because someone still brainwashes them to do so? Be aware while these stocks are dangerous for any investor.
