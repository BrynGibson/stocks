Personally with penny stocks I never hold my position into an earnings announcement. You and I both have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen after that earnings call. So unless you are a long term holder and don‚Äôt really care about ups and downs, I would follow a simple rule. 

The rule is wait for the earnings first...FAR less risk. If the stock spikes up yes you missed some meat there, but usually stocks tend to run for a few days... so wait for confirmed good reaction to earnings, wait for dip, then get in and have a price target in mind or take profits along the way.

The highest I've heard people saying the expect TTI going is around .60 per share. Is this a more realistic limit sell to set to make sure I get the profit while I sleep?

318,SyruporSyrup,fpg4yq9,/r/pennystocks/comments/gd7t73/mvis_premarket/fpg4yq9/,1,"This is the dumbest shit I've seen today and it's already 8 a.m. The only way I would play this is by selling cash-secured puts. You can sell a $1 5/15 put right now for about 60 cents. That means you get $60 in your pocket per contract, and someone has the right to make you buy 100 shares of this garbage fire, again, per contract. There's almost no volume though so this play may only work for a few contracts around this price. That there is no volume doesn't matter for you because you sold the contracts and collected the premium. You don't have to unwind this position. You can just wait.

So what happens now? Someone owns the put that you sold, and can make you buy the stock for a dollar, which sucks, right? Not really. If the stock goes up beyond a dollar, they're not going to make you buy it?l. Why not? Because the market will pay more than that anyway. Think about it...if the stock is trading for $2, why sell it to you for $1. That's why it's called an option, and it's their option in this case.  

If the stock goes up somewhat, between the current price and the strike price on the option ($1), then the option will have some value. They can sell the stock to you for $1, even if it's worth less than that. Let's say it goes up to 90 cents. Selling to you for $1 is a better deal. It also means you are out 10 cents per share, but that's ok, because you collected 60 cents per share already. You're up $50 per contract. 

But let's say the stock falls, which it absolutely will at some point. Your risk is limited by the premium you already collected. Let's say it drops to 50 cents, which would be massive (about a 40% loss in market cap). You still come out ahead because you collected 60 cents per share and only have to pay a 30 cent/per share premium. 

To actually lose money on this trade, the stock would have to fall farther below it's current price than the premium you collected on the option, in this case, to about 22 cents per share. It definitely will fall that far one day, because this is an absurd pump and dump, but probably not in the next ten days.

Also, don't forget the cash-secured part. Don't spend all that sweet premium money on trash from Groupon. You may have to actually buy and own these shares, briefly. 

Tl;dr: don't chase this piece of shit that has already gone up way too much. Instead, make money by selling options to degenerate gamblers like yourselves.",2020-05-04

The topic was how so many people had left $MVIS to work at $MSFT. Huge news! Imminent buyout! Everyone get some! ... then I noticed that the thread was 1 year old..

How long has this name been getting pumped on rumors of $MSFT buyout? Is it closer to happening now than last year?

Disclosure: Selling $MVIS at the first hint of a turn. I‚Äôm still kicking myself over the $350 haircut I took on $UAVS.

https://www.thebalance.com/using-leaps-instead-of-stock-to-generate-huge-returns-358082

For me personally, I will try to find LEAPS that have an attractive price and are ~2 years out. I‚Äôll try and stick to a strike that‚Äôs 1/2 to 2/3rds of the trailing 1yr average. I do this for stocks that I believe will return to what they were trading before an event occurred (like this year‚Äôs issues) or at least 2/3rds of that average. Then I can enjoy an eventual run up when market sentiment causes a bull run for that segment and hit a home run. 

CPE is one of my more speculative plays, but it could net me huge for very little risk to my overall portfolio‚Äôs value. I also own 10 ET $15c 1/2022 LEAPS as their prices are reasonable right now (but they don‚Äôt fit the model I mentioned above. I just work in the space and know pipeline operators well). 

The way you‚Äôre talking about buying is more to sell OTM calls against your calls to try and generate revenue without getting exercised over the time period. Which is a waste IMO.",2020-05-04

I made $1800 turn into $16k in 9 months during the financial crisis using LEAPS on BAC, and I was new to options trading.

Stocks look ahead, they also get purchased for growth not profits.

What is going to cause NAT to grow in value that isn't just a lucky grab of money that will be gone in 6 months.
People knew about the profitability of oil tankers since early april when oil got hit hard.

NAT was at 2.50 now it's at 6$ while the other oil tankers are showing very slow growth. NAT is actually one of the lesser options out of many oil tankers, based on ships and debt. It got a massive pump from Cramer then youtubers then fell from a trading vol of 100 mil to 20, it will probably be 15 mil tomorrow. If you were looking to invest in NAT you would've known that q1 and q2 will look amazing.

So if 300 shares get called before the news, I can play 400 shares on house money. If not, I'll sell my 400 shares around $2 and then the 300 shares are my house money. I can hold them through the news and the news will earn me $900 if it hits $3 after the news. The first scenario is ideal because it automatically locks in my initial investment and leaves potential for holding the stock long after the, hopefully, good news. The second scenario still locks in my profit if it hits even $1.85 but then my gains after that are capped at $900. Basically I'm making a bet that the stock will hit $3 before the news so that I can get rich quick. But of not, I would be happy with $1.85 to break even with 400 shares and ride the news with 300 shares that could sell at $3.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody knows for sure what will come out of the news Thursday morning. The hype that Microsoft is buying them is unsubstantiated and purely speculation. If it turns out to be true, sure, I could see this hit $3 or $4 - but if it's not, this will drop like a rock back down to around $0.50

&amp;#x200B;

Best advice is to buy the rumor, sell the news. In other words, take advantage of the tremendous volume the stock is currently seeing based on the speculation. Buy in, ride the upward wave, and sell before the official news comes out.

Lot of reading between the lines. Then again I have zero experience with if it's of value to reverse split a stock before getting bought out.

Although, I feel like the stock typically drops after a reverse split, which would actually drive value down per share wouldn't it?

I always assumed a buyout would be based on the actual value of the company, but this is just what I know about a non traded company purchase... Guessing share price would impact the buyout to get controlling interest... Unless they just absorb their tech and offices then disband the company itself.

If the stock breaks $3 before the news, hopefully my call with get excersized and it will cover my entire investment and then some. Then I have 400 left over to ride through the news. If the news is amazing, I'll hold and take a massive profit with the 400 left over, if the news is neutral or bad, I'll still profit from the 400 but just not as much as if the news was good. In this case it's a win win if the price hits $3 before the news. 

Then there's the other play, the price does not hit $3 before the news and I sell my 400 before the news drops to solidify my profits. Then the 300 left over can ride the news. If the news is good and the stock spikes to $3 my shares will most certainly get called and I'll make $900 on top of what I sell the 400 shares for. If the news is bad and the price drops I can buy back the calls for cheap to hedge the loss I will have occurred by letting the 300 shares ride the news, but even then after buying the calls back and selling the 300, it will all be profit because the 400 shares I sold before the news will have covered my entire initial investment if the stock reaches even $3 before the news.

&gt; One in your pants is worth two in your ass. 

If you've got a decently sized dick in your hands, stop showing it off in the shower lest you end up with a couple holes filled.

No one can promise you profits on any trade. No, not DD, not 10k reports, not a brother of the CEO and certainly not idiots on message boards. The only profit that's a promise is when the market sell clears in the green. IF you're lucky to be up, then take your scraps and leave when you feel comfortable with what you've achieved.

You see it all the time here that guys talk about ""exit"" points and usually people want to know the ""red"" exit. But really, having a green is equally important. If you enter a trade happy to make X. You make X. Then you leave and stop thinking about it (or reset and create a new ""X"" position). But don't enter a trade, set you green exit at X and ignore it hoping to get to Y only to fall to Z below your original buy in. 

They keep saying, profits are profits. There's a fucking weekly mainia stock here that, as close as you can get, can promise you 5-10%. All these guys holding for their 30-50-150-400%. Let them, take their money and enjoy your ""safe"" (as anything can be) 5-10% week over week. Componding your gains (assuming a trade never goes south on you) if you start with 1k, make 52 trades at 7% and reinvest, you'll see like 50k in 50 trades. That's insane. You're highly unlikely to reach that. 

But you're even more unlikely to reach it, let alone stay there, if you follow the hot trend all the way through the earnings call. Get your profit and get out. Things are always blowing up, sometimes its a stock but usually it's just folks accounts...",2020-05-04

The day it mooned was the release of Astrammune, a product that sold out in preorder. 

Just think of this industry in a post COVID era.

Look at the graph and set it somewhere below the last ‚Äúbounce‚Äù (resistance) so that the price has room to move. Otherwise normal volatility will end up booting you out earlier than you hoped.
