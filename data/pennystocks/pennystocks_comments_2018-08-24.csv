With that being said, I believe the thing to focus on when you start is not making money, instead it's all about experience and honing your skill. I told myself I didn't care about making any money in my first few years and only cared about living to fight another day and accumulating experience. I say start with a small amount and kiss it good bye then make the focus all about experience. If you trade $100 and manage to get 3 good months of trading before you lose it all, I think that's a huge victory.
