American Academy of Pain Medicine in March 2020 is a presentation which will happen on February 26th until March 1st.

SRNE is on a long downtrend. Two-weeks out is generally when I buy-in when I'm looking at the charts and see that they've settled close to a bottom before a rise. I take into account the health of the stock and their product a small bit but my play is to buy-in two weeks out and sell 2 days before the event. 

Bio-stocks are extremely hard to predict. I've seen FDA approval shoot a stock downwards. News sometimes comes out earlier than the date we are given. Sometimes not.

Even low volume (i.e. IMMP) goes up closer to the catalyst date.

I'll take a look at these types of bio-stocks 3 weeks out then 2 weeks out and try to find a safe floor where I can jump in and ride upwards. Some stocks you can ride the waves.
