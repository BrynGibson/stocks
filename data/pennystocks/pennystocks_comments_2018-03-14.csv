Yes 3 trades in the same ticker within 5 business days. So for example, if you buy - sell - buy the same ticker on Monday, you won't be allowed to trade until next Monday. Unless if you have $25K.

It's the closed-doors rooms and groups that either produce their own pumps or weed out noise to produce higher quality results and actionable information. 


Anyone who has been around this sub for a few years can vouch for the pumpers that show up from time to time. This sub in particular is vulnerable to pumpers because only highly speculative traders/investors come here, and a large part of them don't know much in general, which makes them an easy target for pumping schemes. Ironically, a sub like WSB is just as speculative, but the culture of the community (losing is winning) and mod-militancy (ban anyone who pumps pennies) prevents those same schemes from taking root. In places like r/stocks or r/investing, there is a substantially conservative flair to the communities, so pumping doesn't incentivize pumping. R/options doesn't translate to sub-pennies for anything. r/SA and r/TWS are pros, you wouldn't even get your foot in the door if you tried. Seemingly, r/RHP and r/pennies are the perfect demographics for roping in gullible people, you're all here playing $1 Keno and plenty of people are selling game cards. Ample supply. While you'd be pretty hard-pressed to incentivize all these people to drop all their money into a single round of highroller blackjack.",2018-03-14

Went to get short near the end of the day as it began to broke support, and ETrade told me they couldn’t locate the shares to borrow. Oh well. There’s a million opportunities.

One tip to other people trying to play these stocks is don’t let your first idea cloud your judgement, and be able to adapt on the go with the price action.

I watched the stock go from 280-300% up to 360% up waiting for the price to crack, and it was only at the end of the day that I realized if I hadn’t been so adamant on watching for falling signals, I would have been able to long it instead and make 60% in a couple hours.

191,JakeWasAlreadyTaken,dvpwruh,/r/pennystocks/comments/84bnku/how_much_do_i_need_minimum_to_day_trade_on_etrade/dvpwruh/,1,"Yes. 25,000 is the minimum for getting around the PDT rule that prevents you from making 3 round trips (open and close a position) in a 5 business day period. On the fourth, you can close the trade, but you’ll be unable to open any positions for 90 days.

If you do your research and study a lot, you can make it work. PDT is a good thing in the sense that it’s going to force you to only take on the best opportunities instead of trying to open any position you find.

The key thing is to never give up studying. I’m a newer trader myself, but a main message I’ve heard echoed by the greats is that people do one course and think they know enough for the rest of their life. What happens to them? They sometimes do well for a little while, but they always end up wiping out because they let their ego get in the way and stopped seeking knowledge.

As for your question, there’s no minimum for a cash account, but then you deal with settlement times and you can only go long. You can get a margin with 2000, but I recommend starting with a couple hundred more in case you lose money (you will, but limit the losses to 1% total equity per trade no matter what and you shouldn’t wipe out). With the margin you can use margin (obviously) and you can go short.

Don’t let other people sway you from going short. It’s the same thing as going long but in reverse. Sure, the risk is theoretically infinite, but if you’re smart, you’ll never let that happen to yourself. That’s why you cover your losses quick. If you have a bias, you’re basically cutting your amount of opportunities in half. If you find your better at one, stick to that, but there’s no reason to only ever go long because of the theoretically infinite loss claim that’s touted by long-term investors all the time.

Anyways, that’s way more than you asked for but I was hope it was slightly helpful. Best of luck!",2018-03-14

I’ve traded BPMX 4 times since $0.12. I’ve yet to lose a dime. I think I’m at total of 150ish% gain on this stock overall. 

It’s not going to zero any time soon, because the underlying product holds merit and is only rivaled by one other company operating in this same product realm (a gel vs. foam version of the same idea). 

Buy it low and sell it high. Luckily the timing has been such that I haven’t needed to burn any day trade restrictions. 

No one should be holding this stock long term until many factors change. It’s a pennynstock. When it’s green, flip it. When it’s red, wait until it’s green. If you get scared dump it. If you dump it, keep following the stock and see if you can learn anything from the behavior that takes place as it climbs/crashes.

With my initial 1k I threw 50% into a single ticker and split the rest between five others. I was stupid and lost a majority in the five tickers I put 10% in because I figured I'd hold them until earnings and i ended up selling most at a loss. The ticker I put 50% into ended up skyrocketing one morning and made like 70% gains. Since then I've just played it smarter.

Michael W. Moore Named Chairman 

Finzat has named Michael W. Moore as the company’s Chairman. Mr. Moore is a recognized leader in mortgage finance and investment and risk management. During his 15 years as the senior-most financial executive with the Chicago Federal Home Loan Bank, he was the co-developer of Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF), a mortgage origination platform whereby Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) members participate in a unique risk sharing arrangement with their respective FHLB, optimizing benefits for both parties. Mr. Moore in this new role as Executive Chairman is spearheading Finzat’s new product development in the housing market, which is a natural progression in validating Finzat’s token use case.
