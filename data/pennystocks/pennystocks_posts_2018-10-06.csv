1,$BLONF - CO2 GRO,9lx1zg,I_Zeig_I,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9lx1zg/blonf_co2_gro/,1,24,"Ran across this company in the comments of a weedstock discussion and thought I'd share. Currently at 0.15 USD.

They are a new company that specializes in foliar spray, a method of delivering nutrients/pesticides/etc to plants via a mist spray similar to what you see in the grocery store. Their product is JUST CO2 atomized into water to support vegetation growth and several trials with universities are showing it makes a big improvement. 

Currently have US patents and Health Canada is reviewing their application to allow use on Marijuana. I wont get too deep into it all but I think this is a sleeping giant for sure...

Here are some things I found. The new officers of the company and their backgrounds and how much money they’ve made are what really grabbed my attention on this

On top of all of this, I emailed the CEO  Ray Grimm of https://newyounow.com and it is confirmed through him that they are taking ownership of RCGP and there will be filings of ownership change on October 15th...this might turn into a huge merger play guys

Look at Ray Grimm’s success: http://www.raygrimmjr.com

Email him yourself like I did or call

UPDATE OCTOBER 6TH: Filings came out AH yesterday confirming a merger, Guys I’m doing more digging into the new CEO of $RCGP that CBD naturals is merging into and I’m starting to find some interesting things. Grimm was ceo of Laguna Blends, He orchestrated the RM into isodiol, Found a pr from isodiol that says that CBD naturals is a sister company. Helped them develop their water line. Have to ask Grimm. But after he stepped down as ceo there, it said he was staying on as an advisor. I’m not sure that he still is but I sent him an email this morning asking if he still was or not...still waiting on a response. Will post another update when I know more.
