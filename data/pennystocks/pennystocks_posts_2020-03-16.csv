3,Market halt ? No trading in the morning ?,fjhckg,3103MGunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fjhckg/market_halt_no_trading_in_the_morning/,1,2,"Robinhood Logo
Hi Zheng, 

We wanted to reach out to you in the midst of what we know to be historic and volatile market conditions, due in part to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In light of recent drops in the S&amp;P 500, there have been market-wide trading halts, triggered by mechanisms put in place by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Market-wide trading halts are designed to help stabilize the financial markets during volatile periods. Halts are issued by US equities, options, and futures exchanges and can last 15 minutes or the remainder of the trading day. 

Here are some good things to know if another trading halt occurs: 
Can I trade during a market-wide halt? You can place new orders during a halt, but they will not be processed until the halt is over and the market reopens. Please note that market orders held or placed during a halt may fill at a very different price once trading resumes.

Can I use Robinhood during a halt? Yes, you will still be able to view your positions, read your newsfeed, and contact support through your Robinhood app.
To learn more about circuit breakers, trading halts, and how they may affect your experience on Robinhood, please read our latest Help Center article. 

As always, thank you for being a Robinhood customer. 

Sincerely, 
The Robinhood Team",2020-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fjhckg/market_halt_no_trading_in_the_morning/

16,Robinhood warning. Missing money and they don't care.,fjts4v,majestik30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fjts4v/robinhood_warning_missing_money_and_they_dont_care/,2,29,"On Feb 25th I made a $1k transfer into robinhood which became available immediately. Two days later in the same week, I made a $5k transfer into robinhood which wouldn't become available because of my initial $5k transfer (most everyone knows this simple fact). Robinhood even messaged me to remind me that I would have to wait a few days for the full $5k to become available. 

March 3rd I ended my day with, I believe, a few hundred in my cash balance and no outstanding orders. 

March 4th I sign into my account to find a cash balance of $4,765.50 and a notice stating my $5k is now available for trading. 

Now, my math isn't all that but even I can tell you something ain't right with those numbers. 

I contacted robinhood numerous times through their help links and their attempts at a response were to explain to me how balances work and that I must have used the first thousand of the $5k since $1k would become immediately available from that transfer. None ever actually addressed the issue of the missing money. 

The last guy even seemed to understand and wrote that none of the $5k would become available immediately because of my initial $1k transfer two days earlier. But even he didn't address the missing money. I guess he also didn't bother doing the math. 

I write this as a warning to all of you who currently use our are thinking of using robinhood. Your money isn't safe and they could care less with their generic responses. 

I also write this to ask if any of you know what actions I should take to have my situation corrected.",2020-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fjts4v/robinhood_warning_missing_money_and_they_dont_care/

Ideanomics ( Nasdaq:**IDEX**) Announces approximately 1.5 Billion RMB ($ 215M)  Electric Vehicle Order from Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation

  
 \-Order is for 2,000 8x4 meter heavy trucks, for construction project use 

  
 \-Multi-year order is subject to lease financing via MEG and order fulfilment runs through 2022/2023

&amp;#x200B;

BEIJING / NEW YORK, March 16, 2020 / -Ideanomics, (NASDAQ: IDEX), announced a new vehicle order through its MEG subsidiary from construction services company Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation Services Co., Ltd., the leading construction site dump truck operator in Southwest China provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou.

The order is for 2,000 8x4 meter heavy dump trucks, for use in construction projects in various locations. The vehicles cost approximately 750,000 Renminbi (approx. $ 107,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling in the region of 1.5 Billion Renminbi, or approximately $ 215 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 and beyond. MEG has identified commercial heavy trucks as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV heavy trucks deliver significant ROI for fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""We are very pleased to be working with Mobile Energy Group and their Qingdao sales hub for this order, which will see us convert our fleet of heavy construction vehicles starting in 2020 and completing over the course of the next two to three years,"" said Yang Guang, Chairman of Sichuan Shenwu Yunli Transportation Services Co., Ltd. ""The MEG team's expertise and knowledge of the EV truck market, and the associated financing and rebate structures required for the electric vehicle market, were a key factor in our decision in the timing and placement of this order. ""
