16,RTShark,dxjfe59,/r/pennystocks/comments/8cyndn/april_17_2018_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/dxjfe59/,1,CELZ is a chart play over .014. It has triple topped there on the daily.  Break that it's prolly on.  Over .0157 probably pops nice.   That 014 is a wall though.  I sold half of what I still had today because of it.  May add again on chart break.  ,2018-04-17
