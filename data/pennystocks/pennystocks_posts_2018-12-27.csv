1,Looking for a free investment platform for EU citizens like Robinhood,a9xd4b,Elenrai,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a9xd4b/looking_for_a_free_investment_platform_for_eu/,1,16,"I have a habit of not being able to keep my hands off my savings, and I do not wanna tie my money up in a savings account in case shit hits the fan and I need money in hand, trouble is, I work 6 days a week at night, and have a sleep rhythm more in line with someone in the US or possibly even China, I estimate I have around 400$ to quite literally play with every month, without caring about them being lost, BUT!

The trading firms I see recommended from a google search are in the UK or promoted in ways that seem suspect to me, and I am incredibly confused about how that would affect me as a Danish citizen within the EU once the UK decides to get its thumb out its ass and leave the EU...and that variable makes me a little uncomfortable.

So uh...what trading platforms should I in your opinion take into consideration if I wish to trade stocks on NASDAQ and pennystocks??

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I have misunderstood anything, I am quite new to this and a basic commercial education only goes so far in explaining the stock market.

Feel free to ask for more details if needed!",2018-12-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a9xd4b/looking_for_a_free_investment_platform_for_eu/

Got a few hundred after Christmas.  
I was told not to do this because ""Penny stocks are not meant as ""cheap"" stocks to put a few hundred bucks into. Penny stocks are meant for you to buy thousands to tens of thousands of shares of a speculative stock""

10,PBYA 52 Week Low: Thoughts?,aa35xk,IknitSteel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aa35xk/pbya_52_week_low_thoughts/,1,8,"I picked up 3,000,000 shares of PBYA at an avg. of .00032 today. I plan on watching the stock and accumulating more shares if it continues to drop lower, but bought in just in case this is the bottom. 

I am pretty sure this company is tanking due to fear of a R/S and they increased the amount of authorized shares to 5 Billion. 

Despite the above factors, I still believe this is a very solid company. They have been making great acquisitions, increasing revenues quarter over quarter, and are in the process of settling 2 million dollars worth of debt. 

I see this as a long term play with extreme potential to the upside and low cost if I'm wrong. At these prices I think the stock is a steal and plan on accumulating for as long as I can, and will hopefully be sitting pretty when this thing finally takes off. 

I believe there are 70,000,000+ O/S currently... thoughts anyone? Anyone else strapping in for this ride to the moon?",2018-12-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aa35xk/pbya_52_week_low_thoughts/
