8,SDX.V Has very little retail interest,9oea25,BaydinMemeler,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9oea25/sdxv_has_very_little_retail_interest/,1,1,"Check these guys out. Great run E&amp;P company with Moroccan and Egyptian assets. Currently shares are halted as they are working out the details of a deal to buy a significant amount of BP‚Äôs onshore oil/gas assets (Reverse take-over).  I expect the shares will open significantly higher than the 0.96 it is halted at right now and continue to run for a week or so as new retail investors get in. 
My advice: Buy as soon as this baby resumes trading and then exit it in legs after around a week. Institutional money will wait for the retail influx to get flushed out out over 1-2 months before they increase their positions. At that point I will add to my long position (3500@.88) and sit tight for the 2019 drilling campaign.
Do your own DD, this is just a lead. Cheers.",2018-10-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9oea25/sdxv_has_very_little_retail_interest/
