Furthermore, when I look at clinicaltrials.gov, I can only see one ongoing clinical trial that hasn't completed phase 3 yet, and won't until June 2018. An action date will only come after the study has completed. Given what they are studying doesn't even begin to qualify as a priority, you're looking at another 10 months after that.

Also, these aren't exactly groundbreaking drugs they're developing, just some over the counter skin care products. The only interesting one is for psoriasis treatment, but that one is at least several years away, maybe even a decade.",2018-03-08

8 Reasons ADAC will be THE Penny Stock of 2018 

The big story with ADAC right now is its wholly owned subsidiary Alpine Industries, a precision machining and aerospace manufacturing company in Utah USA that currently holds over 30 defense contracts with the US Military (in addition to other non-military contracts). 
 
 

And Yes. YES. YES. YES. They are a VERY REAL government contractor with real employees and real manufacturing and real production and real CONTRACTS! Here are some third party links that monitor contracts awarded by the US Government to contractors:

http://government-contractors.insidegov.com/l/356665/Alpine-Industries-Llc 
https://govtribe.com/vendor/alpine-industries-llc-richmond-ut 

Alpine was recently acquired by ADAC and is just now beginning to get discovered by investors. It had been a privately held corporation until the acquisition. 

Alpine operates primarily out of a 10,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Richmond, Utah (about 90 minute drive north of Salt Lake City). 
 

Now, here are my EIGHT reasons why I think ADAC will be The #1 Penny Stock of 2018 

#ONE Trump’s 2018 Military Spending is $700 Billion 
Spending is up 15.5% from 2017 and we’ve simply never seen defense spending this out of control. Defense/Miliary stocks are fast-becoming the place to be. Military spending in 2018 is slated to be $700B and in 2019 it will be $716B. Companies involved in manufacturing parts for the US Military will see a huge influx of working capital with all this new money to spend. ADAC is definitely in the right place at the right time! http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/a-pentagon-budget-like-none-before-700-billion 
 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#TWO Alpine Industries has a PROVEN track record 
Alpine Technologies has been operational since 1974 and has completed over 2,406 contracts. This is not a fly-by-night-pie-in-the-sky typical penny stock. This is as legit as it gets. ADAC is an INVESTMENT and is still largely undiscovered by the broader market since it was privately held for 99% of it’s time in operation! 
 
Notice they have currently have over 30 US Military contracts! 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#THREE ADAC is now experiencing a period of “unprecedented” growth 
According to recent news Alpine is breaking monthly revenue records. For a business that’s been around since 1974 this is a big deal! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-military-defense-contract-orders-160000386.html 
 
 
 ADAC's parts are on the F-16 Fighting Falcon! 
Notice that Alpine does more than just US Military contracts too! Also notice that 6 of their contracts are currently IN PRODUCTION. Production means revenues! 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#FOUR ADAC is actively WINNING new Military Contracts 
On February 1, 2018 ADAC announced that they won a $1.1M contract to build landing links for the F-15 Fighter jet. 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adama-technologies-awarded-government-defense-130000317.html 
 
 
 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#FIVE Made in America 
 
With a Make-America-Great-Again guy like Trump in office that is increasing military spending one opines that these news monies will be spent IN AMERICA. 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#SIX ADAC will soon upgrade from Pink Current to OTCQB 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adama-technologies-corp-provides-market-180000617.html 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adama-technologies-corp-submits-application-140500879.html 
Why upgrade to the OTCQB? 
 
ADAC will appeal to a larger group of investors with the OTCQB tier. 
 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#SEVEN Potential for more acquisitions 
ADAC has already shown the ability to find and secure profitable acquisitions. 
 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

#EIGHT Military and Beyond 
As a holdings company ADAC has acquired more than just Alpine Industries. It looks like they are actively pursuing revenues in blockchain techonology and cyber defense!
