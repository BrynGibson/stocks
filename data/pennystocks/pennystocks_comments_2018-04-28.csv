The CEO is accessible and based on my recent discussion sales will grow at least 5x this year and the company should be able to reverse years of losses. 

For those that are not familiar with the company below are some developments that have taken place and some catalysts to look forward to:


* Bayer/Dr.Scholl's Partnership 

* B.Braun UK NHS 'Total Pathways' Joint Surgery Program 

* NHS UK Drug Tariff Approval 

* FDA OTC Clearance for ActiPatch 

* B.Braun Germany working on same 'Total Pathways' Program 

* ANDA US Distribution 

* Care Pharmacy US Distribution 

* B. Braun UK NHS 'Total Pathways' for Spine Surgery 

* 9 Country Distribution with MundiPharma 

* Licensing of ActiPatch for 'Pain Gear' product in Asia 

* Distribution with Performance Health, Global Company 

* 5/9/2018 FDA Meeting for adding ActiPatch OTC Back Indication 

* 5/29/2018 FDA Meeting for adding 'Post Operative Pain' Indication 

* Multiple Countries with a National Health Program looking at duplicating UK NHS ActiPatch Coverage 

* Clinical Trial for Migraine Prevention underway 

* Clinical Trial for Menstrual Pain underway

It’s too bad because there are multiple catalysts in the next 2-3 months with little downside or newsflow risk from here. I would encourage you to call the CEO Andy Whelan and the VP of sales both of whom are very accessible to get an update on recent developments. 

Sales will grow by 5x and the company will finally turn a profit this year.
