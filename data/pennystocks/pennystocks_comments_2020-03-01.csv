Losing then is not merely a random luck of the draw; it is unquestionably a matter of personal misalignment. In fact even if your goal was only 1.3 gains per trade this is setup doable in less than 2 trades a week in one year.

The most linear path is all in every step. However what's interesting is there's no ""floor"". It isn't that you lose 100% either if you fail. You just have to double for 10 and gain 50% for 16. And strangely people can make hundreds of bets, even win half, and still fail.",2020-03-01

1. You do not have to buy any stock you don't want (picking the coin).

2. You do not have to sell the stock before the inflection point (picking when to flip the coin).

3. You can wait as long as you'd like (choosing your opponent). 

It's like going to a Poker table and playing against the drunkest and stupidest person there and being able to see their cards and tell them when to raise so you can take their money. 

If r/pennystocks is dedicated to stock picking how in the world did I manage to get some idiot telling me that stocking picking is hard like you, you know, shouldn't do it? 

TL;DR: 

Ask: ""How hard is it (for you) to be right n times in a row? [Insert basic math broken down to a basicer format]""

Response: ""Oh that's a tough one mate maybe you shouldn't do that there son. It's insanely difficult. Doubling on a stock purchase? No way! That's insane!""

Read As: ""I need an index fund because I don't think I can actually make real money doing this.""

Bottom line: *If you don't have a knack or the skill to pick stocks them why are you here?*

TL;DR2: If you can't average consistent positive gains? Go to WSB. Suggest your random and fake DD there.",2020-03-01

The reason I posed this is because (and you can actually pick any goal) is because if we were to take a nominal pittance of $100 and consistently run it through a basic trade cycle we should be able to achieve any goal. You could stop at $25k and just start again with another $100. Basically no matter the rate, time horizon or goal we don't compound bet.",2020-03-01

Yes, you could indeed buy RiteAid. But the points you mentioned are your advantages rather than your downsides. The outcomes are self-defined points across a self-defined timeline (often that's what these places are for: quick stock tips. It isn't a philosophy club for sure) so you could sell at any rate, 1.4 for instance, and sell at any point, .7 per se. The reason I didn't include a stop loss is because most of these assets are volatile and most traders do so over days or weeks not years like say, a value investor.

Basically everyone has explained why it's actually dumb to invest this way since all of the counter arguments are either impractical (long times?) or pessimistic (consistent gains? what's that?) to the actual purpose.

88,Nick11235,fj6hg2v,/r/pennystocks/comments/fbsnun/how_to_find_a_good_stock_for_me_to_buy_hold_and/fj6hg2v/,1,"I'm sure there's some optimal ratio of portfolio to volume, if you get to high, then you just move the entire thing, too low and it's not enough of an impact. I'd suggest starting around 1:10, maybe max out at 1:2 or 3:4. It's all about experimenting, and once you mix in margin it should be tons of fun.

So, the thing is, this is actually a ^(little) bit illegal. I forgot the actual law, but it was brought to public attention bc some boomer newspaper posted some stock tips, lied, but most importantly he \*didn't make his position public\*. That's how they got him, not because he pumped and dumped a stock, but because he didn't disclose. Whether this could apply to a platform like reddit, idk (they've been fighting hard to avoid being called a distributor, bc then they'd not be able to moderate in ways they want as easily). I also learned about this when I was 8 or 9 years old, soooo, yeah.

See if you could find something that is tangentially related to current news, the best lies always have a little bit of truth mixed in. You could always make the news yourself (what's that, the CEO of SPY just got beer-flu? Better start selling everybody! What's that? The CTFRHLO of LODE just made a vaccine? Better start pumping, we're headed to Mars!). For the best leverage, I'd recommend using something in the 5-10 dollar range, as they'll have options available with strikes closer ATM while still likely having a low marcap/volume.

Of course, I don't recommend you do any of this, but lemme know ahead of time, y'know.",2020-03-01

12 days ago

Is  it a prudent decision for a publicly traded company's Board to initiate  and follow through on issuing private placement of Warrants to purchase  Common Stock, all the while, knowing the company does not have the  requisite number of available and outstanding shares of Common Stock to  meet the obligations of those Warrants, should they be exercised??  Further; charging shareholders with the responsibility to ensure the  obligation can be met by insisting the shareholders vote to amend the  Articles of Incorporation to allow the Board to effect and issue as many  new shares of Common Stock they deem necessary, in essence Carte  Blanche to enter into as much debt as they want, all without any future  check and balance, i.e. voting from shareholders rendering their  approval of such debt or capital raising. Moreover; engaging an  unprecedented campaign to force shareholder hands to effect a vote for  another Reverse Split, as a way to also garner the requisite shares of  Common Stock, to ensure the company's obligations under the Warrant  terms and conditions are fully realized, by including in the RS ratio,  enough shares to fulfill the obligations looming from the issuance of  said Warrants. This sounds like an egregious failure of due care in the  exercise of the Boards fiduciary responsibilities and in my belief  smacks of the fraud in the darkest sense.",2020-03-01

You have 80% chance to double your money (or lose it) so if you win you get $200 and if you lose you get $0. So +200.

You decide to break up your bet into smaller chunks of 10. So now you have the same spread but at a tenth of the intensity, at maximum you can win a string of 4 so you get 20 x 8 which is $160.

If you want we can go into the long math of this but basically every iteration reduces your odds of success. You're better off always betting once than betting twice.

Longer Explanation:

Let's take a fair coin. Now if I want to know how often I'll get heads I just take the result and divide by the outcomes. So 1/2. If I bet 100 on one flip I will either get 200 or 0.

Now let's bet again on two coin flips at half the purse at $50. So now you flip 2 coins. Since they're independent it is effectively (1/2)^2 or a 1 in 4 chance of getting heads twice. Your odds of getting the same $200 just fell. You may just break even. 

Flip 4 coins at $25 and you'll find that you have 1/16 to get $200. This continues ad infinitum. It seems like a paradox but basically your risk goes *up* as you try to segment risk. 

Now of course this is a stated problem with known probability so we could use Kelly Criterion to find the profit floor; it will *always* be less than the profit maximum though since it is, in simple terms, just an averaging function. 

Basically once you stop using simple Expected Value alone (for instance aggregating expected values into more complex formulae) you get a clearer picture. The raw EV for all of these bets is the same by the way.",2020-03-01

Email IR and ask him for historical stock prices and they will have correct versions. The reverse split messes with the charts and r/s the entire pre-chart showing incorrect numbers. I believe the only correct stock proce was 14.40 on oct 15 2009 but they only had a 10 mil O/s then so the stock price obviously was easier to move. We now have a 76 mil O/S stock. And of course, just trying to help inform.

Here is an article from oct 23 2014, IBIO max stock price of 3.21

I’m getting tired of nobody doing research, seeing people talk about a stock, throwing money at it mindlessly, then standing there confused and mad how they ever could have lost money.

Do your own damn research into companies before you put any part of your financial future in its hands... come on guys 

Anything you see in blogs or reddit should be taken with a grain of salt. At the MOST it should be a way to find companies you begin looking into and nothing more.",2020-03-01

Ik most everyone is here to make money, but money is secondary to the cure for me... so any flips i make on these penny stocks have gone to that. I dont mean to put emotions down here (stock choices are best made without them) but I'd say any company that works on a cure is good.
