It seems the president talked directly about AYTU medical device.

In paralel, if I'm not wrong, AYTU and XSPA are partners. I realized that last week they have coincidences in stock trends at more or less the same time. Then relationsip is there, isn´t?

What do you think about the partnership? Could we asume is a good point in time to enter for both before a ramp up together to $1? 

Anyone can see the pre-market for them?

 I have my main holdings of like ETH, BNB etc. But I was also thinking of some home run potentials over the next 5 years. All very under the radar, generally losing coins.

ZIL, COCOS, NCASH, ENG ( I guess a tad more notable), and I was thinking of ADA before it ran significantly (might buy a smaller amount and DCA if it turns, unsure).

CYLC has a tiny float of less than 1.5M shares which makes the stock more susceptible to volatility if demand hits.

Shares were also trading roughly 5x higher than current levels earlier this year!

CYLC is looking like a ground-floor situation that could zoom higher as more Americans consider growing plants and cannabis at home.

The coronavirus has changed life for many and being able to grow plants at home without having to go to the dispensaries could be a relief to millions of people.

And if marijuana becomes legalized on a federal level, the market will just grow even larger for the company's growing systems.

A countertop version of the company's game changing growing system could be huge!

Wall Street may be about to get a major wake up call to this thriving and exciting Cannabis company that is trading at just pennies!


CYLC has a history of quick jumps that can produce tremendous returns in the short-term.

This may be attributed to the fact that CYLC has a tiny float of under 1.5M shares according to OTCMarkets.

Low float stocks are considered very volatile vehicles and if Wall Street discovers how tiny CYLC’s float is, it could potentially lead to readers netting some monstrous profits.

The stock has doubled or tripled in just days many times over.

Recently on 3/23, shares moved from $0.06 to $0.1298 on 3/24 for a gain of over 100%!

Shares then sailed even higher to hit $0.18 on 4/1 representing a gain of 200% in less than two weeks!

CYLC was over 30 cents in January and over 45 cents this past October. There could be an epic bounce poised to happen if traders learn more about the company's growing systems.

The upside potential if shares move back to the stock's 52-week high would represent colossal gains of over 300%!",2020-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g73g5s/cylc/

Look at the FDA warning letter to “Pharmatech solutions,” which is operated (or used to be? The website is identical almost to DECNs) by Keith Berman...

I emailed the information email on DECNs page with a few questions pertaining to their announcement today... and surprise surprise received several nasty emails from none other than Kieth himself (or someone posing as Keith; not kidding...). Really doesn’t strike me as behavior from a CFO or president of a company on the cusp of “big deals.”

I think Keith has an army of posters across the internet and has been using the shitty sales of the glucose kits (used to be owned by Pharma Tech; seriously look at their earnings report) to fund his pump and dump strategy.

This guy is a fraud, and for all we know there is no covid test from his company in the works... where’s the hard data? Where’s the device? Where is the company on the FDA website?

Who is Keith Berman and why is there the same fluff filled press releases on his other companies websites? There is nothing of substance to this company, it’s a facade, get out now.

I am not a financial adviser nor an investment professional. Securities investments are speculative in nature and involve substantial risk of loss. I encourage you to consider all investments carefully. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*The Facts\*

BBRW is an established manufacturer of high-quality fermentation and distillation equipment and systems for the craft-brewing and craft-distillery industries. You can view a sample of their products here: [https://www.kinnek.com/brewbilt/#products](https://www.kinnek.com/brewbilt/#products) in 2018, they were awarded Start-Up of the Year by the Sacramento District of the Small Business Administration [https://www.theunion.com/news/business/exemplifying-excellence-byers-enterprises-brewbilt-manufacturing-llc-receive-honors/](https://www.theunion.com/news/business/exemplifying-excellence-byers-enterprises-brewbilt-manufacturing-llc-receive-honors/) They have also entered the market for cannabis extraction systems, their equipment extracts CBD and other compounds from hemp and cannabis for use in CBD infused products. BBRW currently leases an 8000 sqft manufacturing facility in Grass Valley, CA at a monthly rent of $4,861 and plans to lease an additional 7600 sqft expansion of manufacturing space in the same building.

In November 2019, BBRW acquired VetOnlineSupply, a publicly traded company selling CBD infused pet products, changed its ticker symbol to BBRW, the former leadership of VetOnlineSupply now manages the CBD pet supplies devision of Brewbuilt. As part of this merger, the newly formed company authorized the issue $5m of Preferred Series A stock to Jef Lewis, the President and CEO of Brewbuilt. As of December 31, 2019 these shares have not been issued and are recorded on the balance sheet as a liability of $2,289,884 in goodwill impairment and $2,289,884 of paid in capital. As part of the merger, $15,347,154 of VetOnlineSupply’s derivative liabilities were reassessed to a fair market value of $2,273,269 as well as a $5,077 debt to equity swap.

&amp;#x200B;

\*On to the balance sheet:\*

As of December 31, 2019 BBRW had $949,010 in assets, $435,164 of those being tangible. They also held $6,810,483 in total liabilities. As previously mentioned, $2,273,269 of that is derivative liabilities from the merger. Additionally, $1,511,096 are for sales which have been invoiced but not yet delivered. Assuming the company can fill all its current orders and the derivative liability from VetSupplyOnline is resolved, the total current liabilities are $2,325,567. As of Dec 31st 2019, BBRW had a book value of $949,010.

In the year 2019, BBRW did $1,589,728 in sales at a margin of 24%, subtracting operational expenses yields an operational loss of $594,237. As of December 31, they did not have enough cash on hand to cover a similar operating loss in 2020. I believe this is why they chose to purchase VetSupplyOnline, in order to raise money from the sale of their common stock or through the sale of warrants

The balance sheet from December 31st paints a picture of a company which is  growing quickly, but has not yet reached a sales volume to overcome its fixed costs. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Compensation:\*

Currently Jef’s compensation is entirely wrapped up the $5million of class A stock issued to him in the merger. He takes a salary of $200,000 per year and can choose to convert unpaid salary to shares of common stock at market price. Currently he is only expected to take $130,000 of that salary in cash.

The Previous CEO of VetSupplyOnline, Daniel Rushford, receives a salary of $36,000 but also owns 8 million shares of the outstanding common stock shares. They announced a cash dividend to be paid at the end of 2020 to everyone holding common stock and Jan 1 of 2020. This is where Dan will likely derive the majority of his income.

BBRW’s total expenses related to salaries is $515,638 which represents 47% of their fixed costs.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Risks:\*

This is a penny stock for a reason. The biggest risk, besides the continued unprofitability of the company, is potential CEO Scumbagery. At the end of 2019, there where 10 million outstanding shares of common stock, that number has tripled in the last 4 months which significantly dilutes the value for anyone holding shares. But Jef controls 100% of the class B voting shares and is authorized to issue up to 5 billion shares of common stock without prenotifying shareholders. This would obviously wipe out anyone’s investment in the common shares while keeping his $5million in preferred shares safe. He would potentially lose the value of any unpaid salary that was converted to stock, but could easily protect himself by doing the conversion after dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Why I like it:\*

I like BBRW because their sales growth YoY is phenomenal, but mostly I like them because after the $15 million in derivative liability reduction due to the merger, their shareholder equity is $949,010 while their market cap is only $622,000. This means it would cost you $622,00 to buy every outstanding share of the company, and if the company were sold that day you’d be owed $949,010.

Their project sales for 2020 are through the roof. As of yesterday they have taken $3 million in orders already and project to end 2020 with $5 million in orders, compared to $1.5 million last year. They are expanding sales into Mexico, Europe, and Asia and have signed contracts with distributors and importers in those regions. They are also planning to establish a quality management system that allows them to sell their products to pharmaceutical companies and be FDA compliant.

There is an additional COVID play here too. As a business with less than 500 employees, BBRW qualifies for a payroll protection plan which is a loan to be used to pay salaries and rent which represent 92% of the business’s fixed costs. If they had the PPP last year they would have realized $300,000 in operational profit rather than $594,000 in operational losses. The PPP loan is completely forgiven if they keep everyone employed through the end of the year.

My valuation of this company at the current level of outstanding shares is $0.05 per share, and that’s fucking harsh. Most other valuations I’ve seen are $0.07. See HokieHead’s valuations at various levels of share dilution here: [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=155129763](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=155129763)",2020-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g6yyt5/bbrw_is_massively_undervalued/

This has the potential to explode over the coming months or so. A good buy?

This really seems like a homerun, is extremely undervalued...

Its P/E ratio is literally 0.09 right now. To put that in perspective, healthcare stocks usually go around 25 PE, which means you are paying nothing for how much they are earning. 

The market cap is 2 billion.

the Volume is ridiculous, like 12.5 million shares just today.

**is excited to announce they are continuing their rapid growth and expansion plans and have increased sales and distribution channels for their EPA registered disinfecting solutions by introducing three additional distributors.**


Frog Foggers LLC of South Carolina, with offices in Charlotte, North Carolina also (www.frogfoggers.com), and eOn Mist LLC (www.eOnmist.com – to be active soon) of Missouri have joined PCTL’s growing network of fluid distributors and sub-registrants. Both of these companies have commenced sales and distribution of PCTL fluids very recently; production/receiving capacities will ramp up, given growth and volume over time. An additional distributor serving Missouri, is currently expanding into surrounding states. Combined, these three distributors will provide service to the southeast, south central, and Midwest regions.


“**Fluid sales and distribution are a major component of our current model**,” explains PCT Corp. President Bill Prince. “We now have distribution channels either in or within striking distance of several key markets which will be a tremendous source of growth for us in 2020 and beyond.”


The company is reviewing a large number of additional distribution prospects and **expects to continue its expansion** over the next several months with the goal of increasing PCTL’s regional footprint in several key markets.


“**We have many interested parties in our pipeline**,” says CEO Gary Grieco, noting that the company is expanding both rapidly and purposefully. “We are very thoroughly reviewing these companies to ensure they are able to meet both our high standards of quality and professionalism; in addition to being able to effectively service the strategic regions we’ve identified as holding the most opportunity for us.”


To further explain the company’s rapid growth plans, CEO Gary Grieco appeared on an April 21st episode of The Stock Day Media Podcast with host Everett Jolly.

I have to remind myself that there are always going to be good stocks to buy. Just be patient. You don’t always have to get in on every stock that is mentioned or that you’re looking at. On Monday or Tuesday I’m sure there will be different stocks that come up that I might end up investing in instead of the ones I am watching right now.,2020-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7a5tp/there_will_always_be_good_stocks/

Company put a 30% deposit on for the order. Maybe a good one to get into for the long haul? Been watching this company for quite some time and they have been on a steady improvement despite very little movement in their price.

Their PR:

Gaithersburg, MD, April 24, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verus International, Inc. (“Verus” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: VRUS)) is pleased to announce this update on its new medical supply division. The Company has finalized its first order, a $820,000 (USD) agreement for disposable medical gowns for a Danish customer. As it is customary with large production orders to receive an upfront deposit of at least 20% of the order total, the Company received a 30% deposit for this order. This initial order could expand into additional and larger orders in the future.

As part of the master plan to manufacture and develop a complete line of protective medical supplies, Verus is organizing its new medical division under the Verus Cares name. The Company has named Anders Gratte as President of the new division. As a co-owner of the Top Apparel Manufacturing (TAM) transaction, Mr. Gratte has significant experience with manufacturing and sales in the division’s target markets. His international experience is extensive and includes successful business start-ups in Sweden, Denmark, Philippines, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States.

“We are very excited to have someone of Anders’ caliber join the Verus team,” said Verus CEO Anshu Bhatnagar. “His international business experience is exceptional and his knowledge of manufacturing and sales in the protective medical supply market will give us a fast start as we begin to sign orders. We plan to develop a diversified product line that includes masks, gowns and other protective gear, giving us a full product offering with global appeal.”

In terms of operations, the logistical issues have improved to the point where the Verus Cares division expects to begin shipping sample quantities of masks within just a few weeks to prospective customers. Verus Cares has a significant number of contingent customer orders, pending approval of sample quantities, in addition to a growing number of request for quotes (RFQs) from large global entities seeking new sources of supply.",2020-04-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g7a0to/vrus/

If you go back and look at everything their CEO said, it’s nothing but general statements just to pump the stock. They haven’t made a single claim that names a specific company, team, or individual that is interested in their product.  

Just look at his statement on Wednesday prior to their “big news” on Thursday..


""Mr. Berman continued, ""Our discussion this coming Thursday will be longer than usual, and it will contain quite a bit of information, especially as we discuss the overwhelming response received from business and distributors for the purchase of the kits. We are overcome with optimism we are witnessing daily for this truly remarkable product.""

Basically he said “businesses and distributors” are excited and we’re going to talk about the excitement. Nothing specific. All generalities to build hype. 


Then they say “On April 13, 2020 the company engaged a publicist and a lobbyist. The publicist has engaged three media outlets, who have shown great interest in the story of GenViro! Swift and want to interview DECN CEO Berman.”

Which publicist? Most publicists are more than open with what they’re working on because THATS THEIR JOB! Have you ever heard of a “anonymous publicist” before? Which media outlets? That was on the 13th, where’s the interviews? 

And if you look into the “story” of this company you’ll find last November they lost in court after trying to sue JNJ for Patent Infringement over their glucose kits. Because their kits obviously aren’t as special and unique as they say they are. 

[DECN and JNJ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/j-j-beats-decision-diagnostics-again-in-glucose-test-patent-row)


They also said “In addition, the company's lobbyist has engaged several influential members of Congress who have spoken at length with the company and its representatives. The Congressmen have agreed to carry the ball on behalf of the company, beginning with direct communication with the Pence Covid-19 Task Force.”


First of all they go from “engaging a lobbyist” to “the company’s lobbyist”. There’s a difference between DECN engaging a lobbyist and actually having one. Kind of weird way to write that. 


And If this was true where are all the press conferences? We’ve seen congressmen name drop plenty of companies in the past month. The President said people should consider injecting disinfectant! But despite their mighty “publicist” and “lobbyist” Not a word spoken about DECN though...

Now look at this statement about sports teams and Fortune 500 companies....


This process began on April 20. The company's “GOAL” for GenViro! is not just to receive EUA approval from the FDA, but when this approval is received, to become the go-to testing solution, in demand by Professional organizations as well as Fortune 500 companies, even sports teams.

“Goal” is the key word here. They didn’t say they had deals with sports teams and Fortune 500 companies. They said their “goal” was one day they would. 

Everything he said was all fluff. Designed to pump the stock. 

Their CEO is a sketchy. 

[Look at their website. The “board” of directors is listed as one person. Him. ](https://www.decisiondiagnostics.co/about.html#bod)


This company was founded in 2001. Despite their self described claims as being “leaders” in diabetes testing their share price hasn’t been over .60 in FIVE YEARS!! 

Can anybody tell me when the last time this so called “leader” in their industry was NASDAQ compliant? 

From what I can see the last time this stock was over 1.00 was 2010, and it’s all time high was around $1.40 that same year. 

If this was a truly a “leader” they wouldn’t be going to the moon. They’d already be there. They would have planted their flag in the motherfucking sea of tranquility years ago.

BUT THEY SUBMITTED FOR THE SECOND KIT! 

So? They said that weeks ago. 

[first announcement ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/15748533)

On 6 April dude said:

“DECN had originally intended to submit its application for both of its Covid-19 Swift Kit products, the Professional version kit to be administered to by nurses, doctors, pharmacists and other professionals, and the at-home personal use kit we envision to be distributed by big box pharmacies, governmental agencies, home health agencies and directly by our own distributors. But because the FDA had yet to approve a kit designed for individual use, we decided to proceed first with the Pro version Swift kit and follow on as soon as possible with a separate EUA application for the at-home kit as a stand-alone application. We plan to use the same application with minor changes to reflect the individual use.”

Yesterday they “announced that it plans a second EUA submission for an individual home testing version of the GenViro! Swift Kit for home testing”

All they did was regurgitate what they said weeks ago to pump the stock. 

They went from we plan to submit for the second test on April 6th to we plan to submit for the second test on April 23rd. 

It’s all right there. 

Before you invest your money in a company, please read what they’re actually saying. 

I’ve been holding since .09. I’ve been watching it get pumped and tanking and laughing my ass off for weeks. But I’m still up 119% as I write this so it’s easy to laugh about. Especially since I only put fuck you money into this thing. 


It may turn out after all is said and done that their test is a legit product. But their CEO has spewed a lot of sketchy bullshit on the road to getting there and the SEC noticed. They weren’t named in the SEC’s statement along with all those other companies yesterday because the SEC had a special one just for them. 

I really hope this turns out to be legit and this runs up, making everybody a ton of money along the way. I hate to see people lose money. 

Hopefully one day we can all meet up and play bumper cars in one of our many lambos and laugh about this. Until then...

Please be careful when you invest in penny stocks. I’ve said this before, most of these companies are worth pennies because they’re not good companies.

I warned you guys about DECN pumpers few days back. Now, as we know, SEC has halted DECN due to their outrageous claims of ""perfect technology"" and forecasting that ""several hundred million kits will be sold"". I thought all the pumpers would go away now but I see a lot of people are still spreading misinformation and telling everyone to ""hold"" when trading resumes and that it'll be alright. 

FALSE

An SEC halt is no joke. It usually only happens when people are being scammed big times and when the company is grossly misrepresenting something that is attracting investors. 

If trading resumes on May 7th, which it should given DECN corrects itself and SEC is satisfied that they won't do anything more misrepresentation, then this will drop to .10s. And may slowly crawl back to either .20s or back to pennies depending on the update then. 

Anyone saying that this is going back to $0.50 is simply living in fools paradise and probably has a heavy bag themselves.

I now have moved my target for the same time frame to $2.50-$3. And I'm confident enough, and willing, to wait for a while to see that play out. Yet with this sudden volume, I would be almost certain that when this gaps up tomorrow, it go and hit a fatty wall. My guess would be around $1.

Yesterday was a big let down, today is a little scary.

If your money is locked in DECN while it's halted, the absolute worst thing you can do is let these people get your your head and spin you into a frenzy. There's a whole mob of people screaming in everyone's ears

""I TOLD YOU! YOU'RE ALL FUCKING DELUSIONAL! YOU'RE FUCKED! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!!""

Then you have the other end of the spectrum assuring you that this is just a bump in the road and everything is going to be fine, and then go right back to the moon.

Here is the reality of the matter. [There are 23 companies halted by the SEC right now, and nobody knows what the fuck is going on](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-takes-enforcement-action-against-23-companies-for-claims-relating-to-covid-19-2020-04-23). It is not just DECN.

Lets be realistic, that is, at the very least, currently, not a good thing. It's also not the end of the world. It's an investigation, and nothing is set in stone yet, and nobody knows what the fuck is going on.

So please, don't let the whirlwind of vitriol and insanity that is going on in this sub right now get you so worked up that you vomit. First of all, it's just money. Second of all, it's an investigation **not a judgement or conviction**, and we don't have all the answers yet. Take a deep breath, 

Take a deep breath, and try to not let everyone drive you fucking insane. Literally, take a deep breath, and count to 10.

**This is what user Gukaso posted:**

&gt;So this is what I learned from my visit today, I am trying my best to paraphrase as I did not takeout a note pad and jot things down in front of him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Berman was alone and had two ladies working in the office with him, I suppose one was a secretary and not sure what the other one was. He did not seem very professional and his office was not the cleanest. He told me that he does all his PR's, so basically it is a one man show over there.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was surprised to see a shareholder there and said he hadn't had a random person come inin quite a long time. He seemed somewhat unbothered by the situation with the SEC. Initially I asked him what he thought about it and he said that they got the news today through outlets as well, so they did not get any phone call or letter from the SEC as of yet. He did mention at some point that the SEC had contacted him before on a few occasions but he was surprised regarding today's suspension. He also stated initially when I asked him what he thought about how things would proceed is that they would be suspended for 2 weeks and then trading would resume.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked him well aren't you worried about possibly going into the grey list and he said not really, if that did happen we would bring it back out. I said doesn't take time? and he said why would it take time?  
&gt;  
&gt;He did acknowledge that he would put out a PR late Sunday evening going into Monday in regards to this. He also mentioned that the SEC itself cannot delist the stock from the OTC, that it was only the market makers that could do that. I asked him if he isn't worried about the market makers doing that? and he said he had a few large shareholders that would probably be in touch with the market makers regarding this matter. I asked him if he was going to show the SEC what he needed and he said that he didn't need to do that, and that he had talked to a few different lawyers and they had told him he doesn't need to contact the SEC. So again it looks like it is up the the market makers from what he was saying.  
&gt;  
&gt;His thoughts were that a few people or more from the message boards were behind this and that he is aware that there are always people accusing his company of negative things like dilution and offerings, etc. and that the huge trade that was planned out that sold like 9 million shares around .23 was the event that triggered everything. He felt like someone had planned that out over the course of the last month.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked him if everything with the FDA would be moving forward? and he said yes why wouldn't it? I said well I would assume that it would but wouldn't it make things more difficult? He said it may, but not necessarily. That he had two jobs, one was to get the product out and the other to make a return for his investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked him how come he would not show any FDA documents, and he asked me what makes me think that he should show it to the public or what makes me so privileged to see any of that? I said I'm not saying I am privileged I'm just curious. And he stated he is not going to show FDA applications etc. so that any other competition can see what they are doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;I then confirmed with him that at the very least if the product makes it out of the PEUA phase and into the EUA phase that the company would then be listed in the FDA's website, and he did confirm that that would be the case. He also stated that he thought the second application that they will be turning in now he thinks will take a bit longer for FDA to decide upon because of the first application. Not sure why he thought this but seems as though maybe because of the testing they are still finishing and the fast tracking they are trying to do to bypass the PEUA stage.  
&gt;  
&gt;At this point I can't remember much more, but I will follow up with another post and my own personal thoughts.

I wanted to buy stocks on the incline instead of what was flat or declining because I wanted I assumed they were performing well. But as soon as I refreshed the page it immediately started dipping red. Now it seems like a bad idea to buy within that first 10 minutes after opening? It feels like the rhythm is to sell and then buy after the first hour or so when the market stabilizes?

also, i'm quickly realizing that the stock market is heavily influenced by the news. it's not monty fool, zacks, or mad money who has the quickest insight- it's news blogs. I've noticed that all of the health care stock spikes are usually related to a write up in an academic or business website first. these articles are the key i think.

taking all advice. are these stocks recovering next week? what works for you?
