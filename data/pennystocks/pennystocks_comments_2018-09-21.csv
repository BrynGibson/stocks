Speaking of cash, they're down to less than 9 months (?) worth of cash on hand to continue operations. . .
  
And they originally estimated having results for their early feasibility study at the end of August. They pushed that earlier this month to February 2019. 
  
In the past few months, they were getting absolutely fucked by dilution every day first thing in the morning and right before close. The only reason it even looked like it could come up yesterday is because dilution was halted before and after the reverse split, but even then the stock couldn't rise. Once dilution starts up again, it'll be more of the same. 
  
I honestly think they might have a great product but I don't think they have a good shot of surviving. Especially if this second lawsuit doesn't get thrown out. They'll have to waste way too much money. 
  
If they make it to January, I'll see what the price is and how they're doing. But until then, I think it's a losing bet. Lots of people lost a lot of money on them already. I'm not in a rush to join the club.",2018-09-21

But at this point most companies are focused on growth and obtaining market share for post oct17. So the telling numbers I believe will come in the reporting period around February when the first quarter (post legalization) will be reported. Until that time it’s hard/not as telling to look at what companies have done in the past as a compass, because the market is changing and more revenue streams open up. Also when trying to grow at a rapid pace your concern isn’t immediate profitability. It’s more of a “if you build it, they will come” mantra. That said unless the smaller companies can innovate I’d expect a whole lot of consolidation in the sector in the coming year with the bigger companies being the beneficiary of these M&amp;A’s

In the U.S., approximately 500,000 people each year gets a burn that needs a graft. The bonus with ReCell is that it can be used for many other things: Scar removal, acne scar removal, wrinkly skin, any exposed skin from ulcerated skin, road rash from vehicular accidents, etc.

ReCell also received the more difficult to get FDA PMA approval instead of going for less rigorous FDA (361 pathway) that other companies are going for?
