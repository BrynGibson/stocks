I was once a newbie starting out, with not much understanding behind anything; no niche, no strategy, no consistent profits. This week I hit a milestone for the first time in my trading career, while I won't make it public, it gave me a valuable lesson on what can truly be achieved.

Pikers are the traders who have everything to lose. They are the ones who'll see what they'd deem as a ""perfect setup"" and trade it with the same risk as a ""ok setup."" This is absurd. These pikers make these minuscule profits and enjoy the small high they get for the rest of the day. While it's only a guess, I'd presume they'd feel perfectly content with a gain. As they say, you'll never go broke by taking a profit. Pikers, try this mindset instead, if it was a perfect set up, and you're making the same as a normal setup, you're fucking up. 

These educational services, which I decry as being dishonest, seem to preach a piker mindset. Make money quickly, then get out. This leaves the sheep, the ones that follow these gurus, without malleable risk parameters. All trades amount to the same sized positions, thus the value gained on each will be relative to the movement, rather than quality. In other words, a stock with a high potential to move 20 cents in your favor, will be traded with the same size as a lower-quality stock that might move 20 cents in your favor. Here's what a potential malleable risk structure could look like:

**Normal size:** 1000 shares

**A+ setup with a high potential of 20 cents+:** 5000 shares

**It works?:** $1000 gain at least

That'd mean on a high quality setup, you've given yourself a 100 cent wiggle room with your normal lower quality setups. That's only on one trade. You'd instantly be able to bump up your minimum size if desired. 

The next day you wake up, and look at the charts. The prior 3 days have been good to you, as you've gained in all. Let's for instance say you've gained roughly $100 per day. Then you see another A+ niche setup. You've already been gaining, and have that previous gain under your belt, so you risk it.

**New normal size:** 2000 shares

**A+ setup with a high potential of 20 cents+:** 10000 shares

**It works?:** $2000 gain at least

Not only have you been able to increase your minimum size, but now you're able to increase your max size also. Taking that one risk on that high quality setup reaped significant rewards. If you followed the piker route, you'd be up $400 in total after the two golden trades, rather than $3000. Take the risk.

I must warn those who are unable to see the danger in what's stated above. While it's easy to say trade large size on the golden setups, it's difficult to determine what those setups are. Screencapture your trades and watch them back, do it over and over again until most things become a habit. There should be no doubt behind what a golden setup constitutes, when you see it, you'll know it. 

Nothing is riskier than not being autonomous with your trading. If you trade based on what some wee wee said online, you're going to be killed. You can't trade your whole life following someone else. If you put both your hands on your eyes and dismiss this part, you'll end up wishing you listened before you lost everything. Imagine saying that you lost all your money because some wee wee said this super cheap pennystock was a good buy. Be honest with yourself. The existence of that virus is to take your money. Here's a few pointers:

* **Risk 3-5x on higher quality setups** 
* **10-20x if you have guts**
* **Never add more than twice on a losing position**
* **Hard stops are for the bathroom**
* **Never settle**

The (x)-(y) risk odds are what many newbies seem to chase. They look at a chart and think they have a 3-1 risk ratio. Something they may forget is the loss metric is certain, but the gain isn't. To say they'll gain 3 times what they risked assumes that the quality of their trade warrants those gains. This is foolish if prioritized. Rather, it should be something you'll notice once you've placed the trade. In other words, it's not predetermined. This is controversial, since many people preach having a set plan. I say have a plan once you've entered a position. This takes practice, because it'll require snap decision making depending on the time frame you trade under.
