So, when I get out I set a limit buy.  1 share.  I learn others too and do the same. So I get in on stocks at a price I like.

That way all my money isn't tied up in limit buys so I can keep my full buying power NOT locked up. I mean, it might be a month before it gets low enough.  I really don't want all my play money tied up for a month.  

Plus it keeps down the ""cancelling all limit buys for one opportunity then forgetting to reapply them"" potential.  


Once that limit buy executes I research real quick to see what people are saying, what the news holds.  Make sure the company didn't just fuck up enough to scare me away. THEN I'll commit something.  Half of what I intend to ultimately commit.",2019-05-30

2 Invest in what you know
3 Have safe stocks (mutual funds) and gambling stocks (2-5$ stocks). Use the safe stocks to give a baseline for the gambling stocks.
4 No penny stocks, too little chances
5 Divide the avg volume by the current volume. Set a go or no go number, I stick with 500%. This tells you that news has hit that stock.
6 If the opening hours of a new stock are leaping, you want in especially if it’s a niche market (BYND for example)
