-various IMPORTANT business meeting
-patented technology

-Unnecessary Euro Loan Submitted For 2.5m(mnga generates approximately 1m in sales monthly this loan would be paid back very fast but also help very much for upcoming plans)

At this point until further results, I wouldn‚Äôt buy a single share over .30, but that‚Äôs just me because of a previous mistake stated below.

Source: https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mnga/press-releases

Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not selling a single share for 3-5 years, and if I do sell I‚Äôm just short selling at a high to rebuy at a low to level out my high average. I bought 500 shares @.401 about 2-3 weeks ago OUCH!! Current price per share average is .3025)

What are your thoughts? 

How many shares do you have? 

How long have you been waiting on MNGA?

What is your average cost of shares?
