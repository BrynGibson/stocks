What do you think of today's disappointing returns and the health of the company? Do you plan on staying long, breaking even and leaving, or trying to get a modest return on a hopeful uptrend in Monday?

For me, I made quite a bit of money buying and selling during the week but unfortunately bought a decently-sized position on Thursday when it was almost at its high so I gotta stay in while I can. I've made very nice gains and would love to close out my current position at break-even and pocket the returns I made before. This is too volatile for me and if I don't see meaningful gains aftermarket during the weekend, I'll consider selling at less.

For those still optimistic of the stock, after consolidation that we saw yesterday (a sign of buyer uncertainty), the stock price inevitably fluctuates in one direction or the other and that direction ends up becoming the prevailing sentiment over time. Today we saw that unfortunately that was down. It'd be nice if news of the court case can break the cycle and create a strong uptrend but that is rare.

The company is in very dire financial straits and while I know we're awaiting pending news of the lawsuit, there may be more at play than we know. The stock may be a symptom of China's Penny Stock bubble and is not attracting attention of big players because doing a fundamental analysis of the stock reveals nothing promising, financially speaking.

Also, today's low breached 1.50, a key metric in technical analysis if you're into that (me, not so much, but I acknowledge it). The highs today *might* reach $2 if not more than $2 but I wouldn't count on it staying up, if it even reaches that.
