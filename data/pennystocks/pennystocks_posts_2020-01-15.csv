0,Question for Canadians,eoxl0w,globalvoyager,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eoxl0w/question_for_canadians/,1,10,"Hi there. Canadian noob here hoping for guidance. 
1. What platform do you canadians here use to trade? I use the bank because it's convenient even though the fees aa little higher.

2. The bank investing service is warning me against buying otc stocks in my TFSA and bringing up CRA penalties. Is there a big tax penalty or just the standard capitals gains tax? 

3. General question: what exactly is a otc stock. Is it just a company not listed on any major exchanges?

Hope this make sense. Thanks!",2020-01-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eoxl0w/question_for_canadians/
