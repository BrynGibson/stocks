But none of your reasons of “no revenue or profits” matters with a company that is expected to become profitable by 2022 and has an oligopoly on space. I agree with your conclusion, not the premises supporting your conclusion. Many people believe that SPCE will not only be suborbital flight, but will evolve into hypersonic travel where you can fly from a place like the U.S to Japan in two hours. Some believe the SPCE will grow into more than just tourism. Being the first publicly traded company in space and having a large influence on transportation can make the stock worth immensely more than what it’s worth now.

Building hotels is some blabber Branson spatted 6 years ago, it does not appear in the companies plans (website or filings), the only hotel/Moon/beyond mention (in website, filings do not mention anything about it) is about *transportation* which is in direct competition with SpaceX. The business model is SST which is a prototype for a higher altitude ZeroG flight and the potential for P2P Earth travel. SpaceShipThree plans have been scrapped a while ago too, perhaps because it is not a rocket hmm. In the meantime, while they attempt to finalize SST and try to make it profitable at $250k (for reference, ZeroG flights are $180k so it's a tough ask), SpaceX will start offering actual space and Moon flights starting this year as Crew Dragon's paperwork and testing is completed. I wish them well and I can see SST be successful if they are able to make it reliable and cost effective (which won't be easy), but I can't help but laugh that SPCE is considered a bet for space hotels or the Moon, they won't be any closer to that goal than the plethora of space stocks that will open up in the coming decade, built on the back of SpaceX's rockets, rather than a bet on SpaceShipTwo P2P.

DO NOT DO THIS.  Starting a business is a great idea. I’ve done that a few times also.  Study it for a year and wait until you have an idea you are really sure about before you pull the trigger. Study the market. Study your competition. Create a business plan. You have no idea what you don’t know at this point, and it’s best if you prepare and set yourself up to succeed before making the leap.
