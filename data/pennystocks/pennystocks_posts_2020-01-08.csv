One pattern I have noticed that has been very reliable and predictable is when I see that the days/ weeks prior to it spiking the volatility is extremely low and there is almost no movement going on. 

When I see that a stock is very stagnant and the has a morning where there is a ton of volume out of nowhere those stocks have seemed to be really predictable in terms of taking a small piece of that move. 

The thing is I don’t know how to actually scan for these stocks that have very little volume before they spike up.

10,LLEX on the rise - energy is the demand today.,elomx9,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/elomx9/llex_on_the_rise_energy_is_the_demand_today/,1,14,"Due to the recent event of the US base getting attacked, the oil will most likely rise. I introduce you to LLEX's chart, yet another chart with not only just an outside bar but an outside bar with a hodl feeling. Behold: [https://ibb.co/r2bNZCt](https://ibb.co/r2bNZCt)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a DM asking me a better understanding of outside bar of trends. Another example can be found here: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=llex](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=llex) In order for a successful continuation needing to occur is needing to break an all-time resistance, moving with the market, and most important, rally trend.  I love triangles, and a triangle like this is a rare treat not only in technicals, but the fact it's holding well; especially for options users &amp; cash account users. 

LLEX, currently on the intraday has support of 0.65 with a breakout point after hours of 0.77 (new support line). The past two days had the support of 0.77 but fell at the opening today. Has a weak put which is going to ending up backfiring towards the bears. My amounts of money' on LLEX over ZN any day, though ZN in my opinion, is just a shot in the dark lottery hype. Lastly, a very weak wall at $1, with soft volume today's opening, medium volume near closing, and extreme volume push near the losing of after hours. The EPS for LLEX shines positively out of most other energy penny stocks.  

As for HUSA, it tried, but didn't continue forth, leaving me to sell at 0.265 vs the 0.25 I bought last night, though any gains are better than no gains at all. Not a terrible call, but gonna express the obvious to the obvious, HUSA is okay to me personally, but not enough attention on the eyes due to its relationship between the past &amp; stockholders.",2020-01-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/elomx9/llex_on_the_rise_energy_is_the_demand_today/

(CSE: PREV) (OTCQB: PRVCF) (FSE: 18H) (the ""Company"" or ""PreveCeutical""), announces that after successfully developing water-based cannabis extract-infused soluble gel formulations (the ""CBD Sol-gel Formulations"") (see news release dated July 9, 2019), the Company has now completed a preliminary safety evaluation (the ""Evaluation"") of selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations in freshly explanted human nasal mucosal tissue (ex vivo).

Over a five-day analysis period during the Evaluation, there was no elevation in ""clinically accepted"" biomarkers of tissue toxicity. These results would appear to indicate that the selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations that were tested have no acute toxic effects when applied to human nasal mucosal tissue.


As medical research into the effects of cannabinoid acids in modulating disease pathways progresses, it is expected that benefits of cannabinoid acids will emerge, and the Company will be well-positioned with its CBD Sol-gel Formulations.

PreveCeutical's President and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Mak Jawadekar stated, ""The results from the Evaluation indicating no acute toxic effects of the selected CBD Sol-gel Formulations on explanted human nasal mucosal tissue is a good finding, and give us confidence to conduct further proof of concept studies.""

The CBD Sol-gel Formulations, when used with the Company's customized soluble gel (""Sol-gel"") applicator device for direct nose-to-brain delivery (the ""Sol-gel Applicator""), is expected to target direct and prolonged delivery of cannabinoids to a patients' central nervous system.

Future repetitive evaluations are required of the Company's sol-gel drug delivery research and development program (the ""Sol-gel Program""), which may involve pre-clinical/clinical evaluation of the CBD Sol-gel Formulation.

The app for practicing was Stock market trading sim app

I  bought $100K worth of INPX at .50 not too long after it turned down and  I was down -40 to 60k on it and I figured this might happen but I held  onto it because for some reason I thought it might go past 5.00 and it  did not long after I bought it

on the app I sold it at $6.81 so I'm at 1.3 Million starting from $100K

I've heard penny stocks are a scam or an easy way to lose all your investment

Can someone give me any advice because if that was a real $100k I would have just profited 1.2M

I get what I did was unusual and risky and it even seemed I had quickly lost half of my investment \[ 50k \] but I held onto it because I strongly expected it to go up in value and it did 

Are penny stocks scams? Or just very high risk high reward? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can I make money off penny stocks for real? I want to hit 10 million dollars and semi retire but I also have other plans to make much more then that but I want my first taste of financial freedom to be gained from investing in stocks 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big fan of gambling and I tend to be a good gambler and get lucky

I also prefer high risk high reward

And I have a goal of 10 million dollars starting from 100k-1 million

I have a talent that can generate me enough to get that starting amount but it requires some degree of luck and a bit help in completing the other part of it

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm in love with the fact that things can happen so quickly that said I don't obsessively monitor the price very often I tend to buy on my app and check it whenever I feel like it which I know isn't good and I would change somethings if it was real money

I'm still very new and I want to become good  and hit my 10 million goal

If that was a real 100,000$ I would be at 1.3 million now and would be smart enough to back off and just earn interest from that and then keep reinvesting what I could afford to

I also have a talent that can be used to generate 100K or more but it requires some degree of luck and I have to be very creative in that moment..... I'm working on generating money now and debating if I should use 100k or 200k if I end up generating 200k 

Oh Also I like to minimize the type of stocks to few and am in some cases very willing to dump all my money in 1 stock which is actually what lead me to now having 1.3 Million starting from 100K buying INPX at .5 and selling at 6.81",2020-01-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/elmwv7/need_help_with_this_penny_stock_question/
