21,HSGX reverse-merger S-4 filing due before end of next week,bxwvlj,born2rock4life,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bxwvlj/hsgx_reversemerger_s4_filing_due_before_end_of/,39,19,"**Note**: This is my research and my logic based upon that is speculative, so please do your own due diligence. Fpr the record, I am bullish/long.

&amp;#x200B;

HSGX is about to undergo a reverse-merger.  HSGX is being bought out by Ocugen as a shell for Ocugen's makeshift ""IPO,"" which per HSGX investor relations will happen by the end of next week when they're expected to file the S-4.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ocugen has a novel drug therapy for Ocular GVHD (OCU-300/310,) and is a phase 3 drug awaiting results and FDA approval.  If so, there are expected to be 63,000 patients who suffer from oGVHD world-wide currently, with that number growing by about 5,000 year-over-year.  Data from Phase 3 is expected to be released in the S-4 filing within the week.  They also have 4 other unique drugs in clinical stage phase 1 trials which are expected to release results later this year. With no other products to compare their leading developed drug candidate to, CRMD (CorMedix,) is a similar company biotech with one novel drug, designated FDA orphan status in Ph.3, that also has no market competition and several other Phase I trial drugs, and their market cap fluctuates between 150-250m.

&amp;#x200B;

HSGX holders are expected to receive 10% share value of Ocugen at minimum, and up-to 15% maximum.  The criteria for the max being given is Neocart being sold by HSGX (it has since sold,) and them terminating all employees, breaking property leases, asset sales, etc. giving them surplus cash per their merger prospectus to get that whatever the target is for the max (15%.)   That has all been done, so the numbers are all expected in the S-4.

&amp;#x200B;

Ocugen is headed by CEO Dr.  Shankar Musunuri , a former Pfizer executive who started his own company after his tenure at Pfizer, and then led his biotech start-up to commercial success before selling and heading to Ocugen a few years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Breaking down the logic of reverse merger;**

&amp;#x200B;

* It's a stock-for-stock reverse merger
* HSGX gets min 10%, up to 15% of Ocugen valuation / share value.

&amp;#x200B;

 Ocugen wouldn't want to buy out HSGX in a reverse merger rather than traditionally IPO if it wasn't cheaper.   Given the cost for a traditional IPO is 4-7% of market value, plus 4 million in other costs/fees with most firms, lets analyze cost.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Cap /  IPO Cost (millions)** 

100m = 8 - 11m 

200m = 12 - 18m 

300m = 16 - 25m 

400m = 20 - 32m 

500m = 24 - 39m 

&amp;#x200B;

  If they went cheap to avoid listing costs but plan to announce results with S4 filing, that to me seems bullish. They are paying for the company in stock value, not cash. The board who wants the merger sees value it would seem too, given they didn't sell out upon earlier news of Neocart sale. With there being a clause for each company to bail in the merger prospectus, it tells me the cash in hand that HSGX has after the Neocart sale isn't less than what they expect to have in share value post merger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, take a look at the first two tiers at 100 and 200m market cap value. 8-12m minimum in cost for IPO. With the logic that the reverse merger is ""cheaper,"" than IPO, that wouldn't leave much room for cost savings versus a traditional IPO with prior market cap at 9-10m before the merger occurred. All signs point bullish in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

  If Ocugen wasn't able to maintain value after the merger upon the announcement of the news, it's likely the SEC would not have agreed to postpone the delisting of HSGX since they had to appeal delisting with the merger information.    With the value at merger max capped at 15% for HSGX shareholders, it protects Ocugen from giving away more than the agreed upon price in the S-4 to ensure it's still cheaper than traditional IPO since they bailed out HSGX when they needed money, but ensure it has room to ""pop,"" upon their ""IPO,"" with their results filed in the S-4.  There is no logic to doing this RM (IPO,) only to release bad news at their filing formation. If the results were bad, they'd postpone until post-merger and cash out on initial IPO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, upon positive news and it still pending final FDA approval, the likelihood of approval with it being a novel drug, already designated orphan status, assuming it's safe and effective, will be very likely. The strong executive team will help them get it approved also. Other than the drug itself, all other variables are good that it will be approved upon being declared safe and meeting / coming close to primary-end points.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, these are my thoughts, but I consolidated my past few months of research and following of these two companies for those to see how I'm forming my speculation.  Whether you're invested in this or another equity, best of luck with your trading/investing.",2019-06-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bxwvlj/hsgx_reversemerger_s4_filing_due_before_end_of/
