ALWAYS use money you could consider already gone, dumps can happen any second and render your money evaporated.

Now shilling and pumping usually happens after the stock has already ran hard and the people who got in early need buyers, so they’ll shill and convince others to buy their shit.  You’ll be able to tell instantly by looking at the chart that you missed out on the ride, but most people are suckers and buy. So shilling and pumping does work very well, just convince everyone that you’ll get instant riches and they’ll usually eat it up.

I have NEVER been able to buy an OTC listed stock in TFSA.

As for the OP's original question of what the best broker is, its a hard question because different brokerages have various pros and cons. I like TD and Interactive Brokers for OTC Stocks (IB allows access to more unreporting shells, TD has restrictions - sometimes you simply cannot buy a specified stock, or you have to phone them to place the trade on some which is annoying af because wait times can be long)",2019-02-23

I'm super bullish on SSFT. If SHMP could run from sub penny to 95 cents, I'd say SSFT could go multi dollars. SSFT is an AI and other tech company, stock just started running last week. Volume picking up and a ton of upcoming catalysts expected which could send this thing in to orbit. Ie. An acquisition of another AI company, the 2018 numbers which are projected at $7M+, and continued deals with big names. Last year they did deals with Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, the San Jose Sharks, the Golden Gate bridge, Exterro, and more.
