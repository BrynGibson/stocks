Another Tip. It only counts for 3 per broker. So if you use 3 brokers you can do 9 trades a day and so on. While staying on margin

 I also have heard of a broker, the name escapes me right now, that allows you as many day trades as you want. I assume it has to do with cash accounts so PDT doesnt apply and they give you instant access to the funds unlike other brokers who make you wait days on cash accounts.
