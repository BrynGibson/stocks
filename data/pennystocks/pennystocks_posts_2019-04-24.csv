&amp;#x200B;

If you want to watch video instead of reading this thread check the link here for the video: [https://youtu.be/dlLl4OonFNE](https://youtu.be/dlLl4OonFNE)

&amp;#x200B;

As usual I got some backlash from Stocktwits bot profiles about $MBRX while from my observation it seems that those stocks that are pumped and do offerings have the most outrageous comments and general stupidity flocking around that lure some naive newcomers into believing these stocks are worth something.

&amp;#x200B;

$MBRX released news announcing conf call to discuss significant discovery for lung cancer and FDA activity. Sounds awesome but of course only maybe tiny minority knows that they do not even have drug that is nearing the developemnt finish line to start selling. So yes, news from biotech companies can be interesting to trade but not to mistaken with fundamental significance of business.

&amp;#x200B;

Call me suspicious but I do believe this was all just to announced offering next day which helped stock price to tank. These things are so common among nano and micro cap stocks.  How do you think such biotech without revenue can keep on rolling? Of course by offering more shares to new investors and diluting old ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

On other hand $RHE is real business that just struggles currently. Stock started rising on Thursday after hours after dropping 8k. In 8k they announced that they are doing deal to sell their properties for 28,5 million dollars in cash. This money is actually needed for this company while last 10Q (quarterly) filling showed troublesome company's situation like widen net loss, noncompliance with listing rules and troubles with creditors and more. Plus the company notified for late 10A filling which is late and still not released.

&amp;#x200B;

This deal is very needed for the company and the cash can help them stay afloat. So if you are interested in this stocks be careful and look closely to the deal while on 15th next month buyer must finish DD and announce if they are buying the properties. This deal is very needed for Regional Health Properties and can have huge affect on price. So keep monitoring and keep your risk in control!

2,$BIOAQ Bioamber Restructuring Confirmed. This #YOLO may change your life. #DDporn,bgqyco,MildCaseOfTheSquirts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bgqyco/bioaq_bioamber_restructuring_confirmed_this_yolo/,3,7," 

$BIOAQ BioAmber ran a Bio-Succinic Acid plant built in **2015 for $140M**. Bio-SA is a building block chemical derived from feedstock fermented by patented yeasts.

The company filed for **Ch 11** (5/8/18), which was later **dismissed** and filed as Ch 15 with CCAA as foreign main proceedings, PWC overseeing as court-appointed monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

This **plant supposedly sold for $4.3M** in CCAA (Canada) proceedings **(10/22/18)**.

[https://www.theobserver.ca/news/local-news/sale-of-sarnia-bioamber-plant-completed](https://www.theobserver.ca/news/local-news/sale-of-sarnia-bioamber-plant-completed)

&amp;#x200B;

**Fair market value** of the plant in liquidation scenario appraised at **CAD $70-$95M** per Nexant (5/22/18, appraisal ordered by PWC).

*See Nexant's appraisal on page 6:*

 [https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/car/bioamber/assets/bioamber-009\_060718.pdf](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/car/bioamber/assets/bioamber-009_060718.pdf) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Although the plant sold, the transaction remains ongoing. The **court ordered stay** has been **extended multiple times** **despite transaction closing 6 months ago**.

[https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/insolvency-assignments/bioamber/court-motions-and-orders.html](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/insolvency-assignments/bioamber/court-motions-and-orders.html)

&amp;#x200B;

The transaction is starting to look like a ""**Stalking Horse Bid**,"" in which the winning bidder required a **two-step transaction** via **IRC §368(a)(1)(D)** in order to utilize Bioamber's **considerable tax attributes**.  

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/368)

&amp;#x200B;

Both PWC and Blakes (BioAmber's Canadian legal counsel) have named this transaction a restructuring.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The purchaser (a JV between LCY Chemical &amp; Visolis) also purchased the plans &amp; permits for a second plant which require said licenses &amp; agreements.

&amp;#x200B;

LCY Chemical was just acquired by KKR for $1.5B on 1/31/19.

&amp;#x200B;

Visolis was seeded by Royal DSM, and retains a branch office on the same campus as DSM.

**There are many reasons why the shares may stay alive :**

&amp;#x200B;

* $320M in NOLs

&amp;#x200B;

* An agreement with CJ Cheljedang including plans for a (70/30) joint venture in future plants.

&amp;#x200B;

* Licenses &amp; Agreements required to run the plant and fulfill off-take agreement are tied to BioAmber Inc. ($BIOAQ)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely KKR is providing financing for $BIOAQ restructuring and future plants in order to expand their recent acquisition of LCY Chemical.

Very big names in the mix: KKR, LCY, DSM, Cargill, Vinmar, CJ Cheljedang

Total lottery play but the more I read, the more I like the odds.
