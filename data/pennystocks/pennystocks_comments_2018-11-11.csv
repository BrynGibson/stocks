9,ashimara,e9hk4kk,/r/pennystocks/comments/9w4qk9/camber_energy_cei/e9hk4kk/,1,"Why are they "" mostly to exceed expectation because of the recent debt ""?

I thought that the companies major assets were transferred with the bank note transfer a couple months ago.  Also, are you talking about the warrants and the bank debt or just the bank debt? 

What does the company currently own that is exciting and will drive value?

Honestly, when I went through their filings.  Their structure and financial position were very odd.  I try not to even buy speculative plays in companies that don't have a clear value proposition.  Might be a decent stock to watch for a day trade on momentum.

Best of luck",2018-11-11
10,slapsahoe,e9hkifc,/r/pennystocks/comments/9w4qk9/camber_energy_cei/e9hkifc/,1,Thanks a lot I’m new to trading for answering. I’ve been following them for over a month now. I have a small position in the company from what I got from there debt settlement they are receiving  payment for assets sold and has double their profit (since they no longer have a debt payment that ate up half their monthly income)that is why I figure they would exceed their expectations. ,2018-11-11
