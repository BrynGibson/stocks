Meaning their distribution chain which would also leave them with a good estimate of their forward guidance. Sure, they know where they’d like to be or what to do but they have to wait and see who all is going to become regular clients. From that point, they will have a much better picture of where they currently sit and then build from there. ",2019-02-06

It just needs to hit that threshold where it starts showing up a lot more regularly. So we can get good analyst reviews and estimates and sentient on this company. It may take a while but I think I’ve made up my mind and will start investing little bits here and there. Gonna follow what one guy does with all his penny stocks. He sets a super low price, maybe whatever the 52wk low is/was, and just make a good till cancelled purchase. That way, every time it hits the very bottom, it automatically purchases the stock.

81,1Dru,eg293xl,/r/pennystocks/comments/anle0b/what_is_driving_shmp_so_fast_and_crazy/eg293xl/,1,"I only have $1k right now. I kept selling for some reason. I mean, this is an absolute first for me. I have never seen a sub penny stock do this. This is an extremely rare event. Even more so when you throw in the fact that it has jumped to $.70 in just over a weeks time. Well, not sub penny. But from .01-.02 to where it is now. Once it came out of the sub penny area, it gained attention and blew the hell up. The patent being approved helped massively. Also, Morningstar has them rated with a fair value at $1.35. ",2019-02-06

I screwed myself basically all week last week because I kept waiting for a drop or even a reversal back down. I’ve seen it happen too many times. But I’ve bought in at .55 and .70 because the damn thing just keeps climbing 20-40+% a day lol. So yea,
