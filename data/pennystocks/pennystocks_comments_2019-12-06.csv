I’ve heard some people say that you can’t buy/sell more than once per day, and at most 3 times per week. Does that mean everyone that is working with $500-$5k are investing only once per day in some situations? What about when a company has a morning rise? Can these people not play those due to needing full access during the day?  Does this mean if I were to only start investing with $1k I would be at a disadvantage/not be able to take advantage of certain rises and dips?

I’m sorry but google didn’t really seem to help because I got some conflicted answers regarding this.
