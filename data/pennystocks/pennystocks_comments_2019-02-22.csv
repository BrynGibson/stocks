That didnâ€™t work till I understood this 
If a stock is between 5- 10 $ youâ€™re buy size has to be at least 200 shares that way a penny equal to 1$ or around there so that a 1$ move is 100$ in profits 
If it drops 20 cents thatâ€™s thatâ€™s 20 to 40$ in loses 
I try to keep my risk to reward at that range trying only to lose 20 $ 
If the price is 1-5 $ itâ€™s 300 shares
25cent to 50 cents a thousand shares
As the price of the stock gets  cheaper you need more shares so you can get out with it only going up 20 cents if it goes down 5 cents take the loss 
Iâ€™m trying my hand at .01 to.001 this takes some patients since they have so many shares but even there Iâ€™ve learned it takes 100$ 
At first ( and if my money is tied up I still do) I start early in the morning hunting the stocks that are gapping up looking for one with news and 15 million or less available shares and paper trade with 500 $ not allowing more than  a 50$ loss Iâ€™m about 3 out of 5 averaging 150$ a day it took me about 6 months 
Itâ€™s not the winning itâ€™s the losing you need to get good at Try not to lose more than 5 percent
