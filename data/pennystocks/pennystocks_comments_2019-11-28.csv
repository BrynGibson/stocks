Niche you say?

 

Oral and gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis affects almost all patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and [hematopoietic stem cell transplantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation) (HSCT), 80% of patients with malignancies of the head and neck receiving radiotherapy, and a wide range of patients receiving chemotherapy. Alimentary tract mucositis increases mortality and morbidity and contributes to rising health care costs.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis#cite_note-Rubenstein-3)

For most cancer treatment, about 5‚Äì15% of patients get mucositis. However, with 5-[fluorouracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil) (5-FU), up to 40% get mucositis, and 10‚Äì15% get grade 3‚Äì4 oral mucositis.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis#cite_note-Rubenstein-3) [Irinotecan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan) is associated with severe GI mucositis in over 20% of patients. Seventy-five to eighty percent of bone marrow transplantation recipients experience mucositis, of which oral mucositis is the most common and most debilitating, especially when melphalan is used. In grade 3 oral mucositis, the patient is unable to eat solid food, and in grade 4, the patient is unable to consume liquids as well.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis#cite_note-Rubenstein-3)

Radiotherapy to the head and neck or to the pelvis or abdomen is associated with Grade 3 and Grade 4 oral or GI mucositis, respectively, often exceeding 50% of patients. Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, pain and decreased oral function may persist long after the conclusion of therapy. Fractionated radiation dosage increases the risk of mucositis to &gt; 70% of patients in most trials. Oral mucositis is particularly profound and prolonged among [HSCT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation) recipients who receive total-body irradiation.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis#cite_note-Rubenstein-3)",2019-11-28
