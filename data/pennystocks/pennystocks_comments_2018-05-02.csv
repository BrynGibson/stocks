They pump and dumped their gold mining company in Africa that never actually owned mining equipment or claims, just a shell company with fake press releases and fake degrees etc.

Then when the stock was destroyed they restructured for the crypto craze and changed the name to Santo. They then created fake partnerships with Asian mining companies, lied about acquisitions, would fake press releases about earnings reports and “big news” with Canoepool upcoming. Eventually after enough heat on the dump part of the fraud, they made their twitter private, A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY, made their twitter private and began to delete users that called them out. Eventually they just gave up the fraud and deleted their website, social media, and support phone numbers. Now magically they are reformed under a new ICO with fake Ivy League degrees and incorporated in another non extradition country. ",2018-05-02

Usually just before a companies earnings report the stock jumps, it doesn't really matter if the earnings we're good or bad because you'll be getting out before the actual news released. This is called buy the hype not the news. 

Other stocks fairly consistently go up and down a certain amount and you can just keep buying low and selling higher. These are typically in the small range like 4-10% but if you watch a couple and do this a few times a week the profits add up. Consider an average of 10% gain per week which would be 520% at the end of the year vs the average 401k or etf which are usually in the 8-18% average. You just have to keep up on the news and hype to ensure the bottom doesn't drop out while you're in it. 

Or you could play the penny stocks that are hyped on various sub reddits, keeping in mind that many are pump and dump specials and as long as you're in early there's usually still room for more pumping as long as you don't get greedy and take 10-15% gains and GTFO. 

It's basically gambling with some numbers and statistics involved. ",2018-05-02
