(PURA) announced their intent to acquire Nouveau life pharma (NOUV) and turn them into their main Cannabis growing compound. They have 25 greenhouses located in Texas and are planning on building another 400+  

NOUV is currently priced at .0003, my thoughts are that after the acquisition and restructuring we could see a major bump in price. Nov. 15th is when the acquisition is supposed to be made official, I have picked up 1.3 mil shares on this... it feels like there is no where to go but up.

Anyone have any thoughts?",2018-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9rnlp4/pura_acquisition_of_nouv/

*This is strongly endorsed by* [u/DickheadEngineer](https://www.reddit.com/u/DickheadEngineer)*, the prophet who called out LODE at $0.15*

In 2017, they produced record levels of molybdenum at their Gibraltar location, despite dealing with the raging forest fires in British Columbia, with the two towns the majority of their workforce lives in being evacuated, and operating at minimum required number of employees. The fires in 2017 halted access to a new zone of the mine with higher grade ore, so they supplemented with stockpiled ore. The new zone is being tapped now. Share value decreased early 2018 due to the results of using stockpiled ore. Gibraltar mine has 21 years of life left in it, so there is still a ridiculous amount of ore to be taken. The Life of Mine annual average production is 140 million pounds of copper (\~$3/lb) and 2.6 million pounds of molybdenum (\~$30/lb).

The new plant at their Florence Copper mine was built in January and it is to be finished any day now, coinciding with the establishment of the leaching process in that same location. The first copper produced at this location will come before the end of 2018. The pre-tax net present value of this operation is $920 million. 85 million pounds of copper production capacity. 21 year mine life.

They’re in the final stages of releasing a technical report for their Aley Niobium project. With strong economic expectations and scalability. It cost them $5.4 million for the land, and invested $30 million into it, with a pre-tax net value of $860 million. This is the worlds largest Niobium deposit outside of two mines in Brazil. Niobium is used in all sorts of steel production, such as turbines, aerospace and automotive industry, oil and gas pipelines, and on and on.

They’re currently working on legal proceedings to start at New Prosperity, which has 5.3 billion pounds of copper (\~$3/lb) and 13.3 million ounces of gold (\~$1250/oz). “New Prosperity is a project that holds the potential to dramatically increase shareholder value and improve the economic well-being of local communities. Development of this large-scale deposit will be a major step towards transforming Taseko into a strongly positioned mid-tier mining company.”

Consistently exceeds growth compared to mining indices.

AND, earnings are 10/31 after hours.

I have no idea how this will pan out, though I do have a small position, 10 11/16 $1 calls, at $0.05, and 70 shares at 0.6576. My girlfriend was thoroughly convinced and threw $250 at it. I also know DE has some calls on it too. With that said, I will reiterate, I don’t know where this stock is going, but I have heard hypotheses of $1.20 by 11/15. Or you could lose all your money. I don’t know. I’m not telling you what to do. I’m not your mom!

Lastly, I’m excited. That is all. Feel free to post any corrections or updates you may find. And let’s make some money.",2018-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9rjzpi/dd_on_tgb_originally_posted_by_usamsonight4444/
