On the other hand it will not happen over night. I believe it will take a fairly long time for people and businesses to load enough data for this to be appealing for a buy out. So what to do in the mean time. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with holding long and forgetting about it. But another strategy is to play this thing by the OTC‚Äôs ‚Äúunwritten‚Äù rules. Some of those rules are sell the news (just have to figure which news constitutes a selloff), always take profits, play  pump &amp; dumps to your advantage.   If you start learning some of these rules you can make a lot of profits, then buy back in and even swing trade to accumulate more shares, then hold those free shares for long run while you have a pocket full of money. I do plan on taking a small portion of my profits to start a long position (like you are) a little later down the road. It feels much nicer to do that with free shares and a pile of money. Why the rant?? I‚Äôm simply hoping that what I‚Äôve learned playing this OTC can help some of you.

I didn‚Äôt invest much, but I was cautiously optimistic that we‚Äôd hit .04 at which point I was going to sell. Has anybody here used the app? I don‚Äôt have an android so I can‚Äôt test it. The videos I saw of it in action looked kind of sketchy. The concept is huge, I‚Äôll give you that. I come from digital advertising and this has huge monetization potential.

Here‚Äôs my BUTS. The website for the company developing it, honeycomb digital, is not even mobile optimized. Red flag for me. That‚Äôs the least you can do. The UX on the app looks terrible. Let‚Äôs be honest. The rendering of the arks looks more like a wireframe than anything ready for public consumption. The engine they‚Äôre running it on is publicly available source code. Are they just riding on the patented concept giving them value? I wish I could test it personally on iOS, but my gut feeling is that it‚Äôs far from a finished product.

I can‚Äôt find it atm but some of the investors in tautachrome have a checkered past at best. Some have been involved in other fantastical tech innovations linked to OTC. I can‚Äôt really figure out their endgame. If they‚Äôre legit or if they created all this buzz, including the telegram support group, to pump and dump this. I mean, that is a massive amount of work to run all those sock puppets.

The dilution from the offering is crazy. You can calculate the market cap before and after the offering. Market cap before offering was the same at 8$/share as it is 1$/share (comparable at least). That gives you an idea of the dilution at play here. I would have stayed in yesterday had the bounce yesterday not been attributed to news.

They could be going under soon unless they have a turnaround, which is why I sold. They have a lot of debt, not enough liquidity to cover their current liabilities and are losing money, iirc.

88,GourmetFilet,euv49hd,/r/pennystocks/comments/ch4aqx/ttcm_slide/euv49hd/,1,The app roll out was botched. Treating the official launch in play store like a beta. I thought the whole reason to have a beta group of testers was for a legit launch?? Glad I profited but I keep thinking what could have been if this company did it the right way,2019-07-24

92,Anarkrist,euw6qm4,/r/pennystocks/comments/ch4aqx/ttcm_slide/euw6qm4/,1,"I'm not disagreeing with you but, as a trader, I look for value. There is value in this IDEA. Now that they have opened the app up to allow you to add ""friends"" and such, and you can see their ARks, I can see the value. As it stands, there is no value in the application, but the potential is there, and I'll be interested to see IF the social media aspect (which is confirmed by testers to be in the 2.0 private beta) really brings anything to the table.

I'm interested enough that I'm buying at .017 and below. I may trade it between that level and around .02, but at least there is action coming from inside Tautachrome, and that action is visible, somewhat, to those on the outside. 

My gut is that this has some legs, eventually. But they really need a partnership, IMO.",2019-07-24
