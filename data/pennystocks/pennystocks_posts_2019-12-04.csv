If you're interested in trading pennystocks and other low cost stocks, I really suggest downloading Robinhood. Its a cool app that allows you to create your profile, start looking at stocks (and their history) and buy/trade. I've only spent like 10 bucks just to trade around stocks, currently, I invested in a stock that gets me monthly dividends. You don't need money to start a profile. :) 

Below is a link to sign up. Once you sign up you and I get a free stock (100%). Additionally, we also have a 1 in 150 chance of getting Berkshire Hathaway ($218.2), Facebook ($198.76), or Microsoft ($149.57) stock.  Lastly, also a 1 in 150 chance of getting GE, Ford, or Energy Transfer stock. 

Thank you and happy holidays!

I did some trading years ago at did pretty well (\~125% increase in \~14 months) but it was pretty much luck. I bought stock in a few companies that I liked, and they just happened to take off.
