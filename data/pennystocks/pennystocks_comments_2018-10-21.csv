18,acrotalus,e87dgds,/r/pennystocks/comments/9q72st/is_hiph_the_next_vitamin_water_red_bull_monster/e87dgds/,1,"Here is a recap of some of the recent current events for HIPH

1) Ryan Fishoff, CEO of American Premium, has a tremendous background which has groomed him for the success that he’s directly responsible for up to this point bringing HIPH from .0035/share to it’s current pps of .09 (a 2,471% increase). Fishoff graduated from Boston University and most recently was a Merger and Acquisitions Manager at CoBe Capital where he was directly responsible for over $500 million of M/A’s. 
https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfishoff/ 

2) ACCELERATED REVENUE GROWTH: Sales over the past 4 years (2017- $208k, 2016- $44k, 2015-$37k, 2015- $134k) 
https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HIPH/financials
Sales from the PREORDERS of the hydrogen infused CBD drink ALONE which was JUST RELEASED last month in September, 2018 were “well in excess of $200k” as noted by Fishoff. Sales from preorders of this one product alone exceeded sales in all of 2017!!! 

3) DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT for various beverages of HIPH with SingleSeed.com just occurred a couple of weeks ago! Lalpina hydrogen infused CBD water is already the #1 top seller on their website! 

4) HUGE meeting Fishoff just had with National Beverage (Nasdaq company ticker: FIZZ) on October 19, 2018! What will come of this? Will there be a potential partnership/distribution agreement, outright acquisition of $HIPH or a percentage acquisition of HIPH by $FIZZ are all possibilities. 

5) Fishoff has made it known there are 4 UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS that HIPH will make in the coming months (3 will be in the CBD/THC space and the other company has yet to be revealed which industry it will be in). Fishoff has mentioned he is looking to get into the CBD pet care business and the CBD topicals mens grooming products business as well. 

6) HIPH acquired Gents Co. last year, a high-end men’s accessories company carried in Bloomingdale’s, Saks and Nordstroms. (mostly hats: leather, wool, other fine materials and they are quite stylish…LeBron James actually is wearing a Gents Co. hat in of his pics on Instagram) www.Gentsco.com 

7) Fishoff has announced a JV to expand Gents into China (1.3 billion people live in China compared to 330 million or so in the States where Gents is currently sold.) 

8) Various podcasts from Fishoff are attached

9) Uplisting to OTCQB from Pink Sheets by the end of 2018 which requires audited financials and other stricter regulations which are all a positive development for $HIPH. 

10) $HIPH is in an agreement with Worthy (owned by Cardi B.) www.worthylux.com 

11) Fishoff is working to get product back on Amazon.com soon. LALPINA water was previously on Amazon.com in the past. 

12) Fishoff recently announced that HIPH has developed a prototype of a hydrogen infused THC drink and this will officially hit market by “the end of the first quarter or sooner.” 

13) Coverage from various third parties including ValuEngine and www.SeeThruEquity.com. SeeThruEquity officially began coverage of HIPH in Q2 of 2018 with an initial price target of .15/share. A couple of weeks ago, SeeThruEquity revised their price target upwards and set it at .30/share. As HIPH gets closer to .30, there will certainly be another revision. 

14) Fishoff is working on creating “IP to support our beverages.” (listen to Uptick Newswire podcast from 7-26-18) https://upticknewswire.com/interview-ceo-ryan-fishoff-of-american-premium-water-corporation-otcpink-hiph-4/ 

15) Fishoff created FashionCoinX exchange and THRD coin (multi branded utility coin traded on Fashion CoinX eschange…Gents and Worthy are already part of this coin)- an exchange to create utility tokens for their brands to engage their customers and provide deals to their customers. 

16) The LALPINA brand has over 1 million followers on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/lalpinabrands/ 

17) HIPH is a very unusual conglomerate microcap company in that it’s involved in just one industry but many including: 
1) Cannabis (hydrogen infused waters containing CBD or THC) 
2) Beverages (various hydrogen infused waters: regular, CBD and THC) 
3) Retail luxury (Gents Co. and Worthy) 
4) Cryptocurrency(FashionCoinX and THRD coin) 

18) Agreement with Soul Cycle for Gents clothing as well as LALPINA water 

19) Agreement with GNC (General Nutrition Center) 2 stores in L.A. for LALPINA water. This should expand worldwide as we ramp up production with our various waters. 

20) What’s the BENEFIT of drinking hydrogen infused water? 
HIPH is the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused CBD product and will be the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused THC drink as well! With hydrogen infused CBD water, about 90% of CBD is absorbed into the cells of the body immdediately so we can use much less CBD in order to achieve a greater effect compared to other CBD waters. 
With other traditional CBD waters, about 90% of the CBD is NOT ABSORBED into the body. There’s only about a 10% absorption rate. 

21) Celebrity endorsements (American rapper Flo-Rida, NBA star J.R. Smith, Pop singer Christina Milian, actress Cheryl Hines and others)

Sounds amateur, but one of them is barriers to new entry, and the beverage industry is notorious for this. The companies that most are familiar with have EXTREMELY high costs in marketing, advertising. This would make it very hard for HIPH to get anywhere you suggest. I know their drinks are in an emerging sub-market of beverages with their CBD and soon to be THC infused products that bypass cells in the bloodstream or something like that, but some of the most fundamental industry analysis sometimes need to be reminded. 

But hey, who knows? The cannabis industry is very, very young right now. I’d throw a penny at it. Good luck.

Ezra Beyman and Reliance Global Holdings controlled 1/3rd of the US mortgage market in 2008. Reliance Global Holdings has purchased the shell EOMN and has publicly announced in the latest PR that it will be entering insurance and real estate assets into EOMN. 

Relianceglobalholdings.com domain is owned by an entity called Empire Network as of Aug 17 2018.

Efficientcorporate.com domain is also owned by Empire Network as of Aug 28 2018. Efficient Property Management, a subsidiary of Reliance Global Holdings, owns thousands of units throughout six states. 

In the last paragraph of Bill Phillips bio you can see where Reliance owns Efficient Property Management.

Press release guaranteeing that EOMN will soon operate in the insurance and real estate industries.

Ezra controls Empire Equity Group, Empire American Holdings, Reliance Global Holdings. There is no telling what chunk of the assets will be listed here, but Efficient Corporate manages +2,500 units on their own. IMO that is going to be listed under this ticker most definitely. Let's try and find more domains of Ezra's subsidiaries that are owned by the entity ""Empire Network"" It certainly would fit EOMN nicely.

In February of this year Reliance Global sent a offering to the SEC which had an ""initial portfolio"" of multi family housing properties totaling 17,000 units across multiple states. This portfolio was valued at 1.7billion via the filing. Read it. It goes through their entire OTC fallback plan if they did not go the IPO through NYSE, Nasdaq route. They mentioned nothing of insurance entities in the filing and the fact that they have been added to the group of assets that will be entering this EOMN entity improves the value exponentially. Reliance owns tons of insurance entities across the US. (Valued at 1b.) 

Properties in the ""initial portfolio"" listed in SEC filing from Teiler match those found on RelianceGlobal. They may have gone bigger than they planned in the beginning. Going to announce soon IMO

It’s going to be huge. Ezra Beyman, billionaire, has the money and the reputation to take this where it needs to go. Many RM’s don’t have all the right pieces, this one has all of them. Best RM potential I’ve ever seen.
