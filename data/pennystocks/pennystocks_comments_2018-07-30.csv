-- solicit liquidators to bid on the acquisition and disposal of the

company's assets, including the Sarnia plant;

-- continue to actively engage with Qualified Bidders and other interested

parties to determine if, and under what terms, a transaction that would

result in the continuation of the company's operations is still possible.

We estimate this process will be conducted over an approximate two-week period with a target conclusion date of August 14. The company will engage with Maynbridge Capital, its interim lender, and all other secured lenders to determine the best going-forward strategy.

""We are clearly disappointed that the Qualified Bidders did not place an acceptable offer for Bioamber,"" stated Richard Eno, CEO. ""We will continue to be actively engaged with potential investors to seek an acceptable transaction and avoid the liquidation of the company's assets. Most importantly, I'd like to thank our dedicated and highly capable employees for their outstanding service to the company.""

Potential investors can contact Richard Eno in order to express interest in acquiring the assets or investing in the business.

Note that there can be no guarantee that the company will be successful in securing further financing or achieving its restructuring objectives. Failure by the company to achieve its financing and restructuring goals will likely result in the company and its subsidiaries being liquidated. Liquidation will almost certainly result in no residual value for non-secured creditors and equity investors.""",2018-07-30
