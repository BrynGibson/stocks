24,JETMF,7sg58b,ForAnarchy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7sg58b/jetmf/,18,17,"JETMF, or Canada Jetlines Ltd., is a Canadian based airline company attempting to capitalize on the ultra low cost airfare market. They currently are planning to launch with 4 planes (leased), with plans to offer low fare flights throughout limited routes in Canada, with goals to expand into international (primarily US) routes. They are attempting to limit operating costs by being based in secondary airports in large areas. Currently unprofitable, as they have not begun any flights, which are planned for Summer 2018.

This is just some cursory information I learned through my research, though I do encourage your own DD before jumping into this stock. Could be a reasonably sized ultra budget airline in the future, could also fall flat.

Full disclosure: Purchased 1200 shares on the dip yesterday, currently up 21.4 percent, though I wouldn't count on them to continue climbing sharply in the short term.",2018-01-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7sg58b/jetmf/
