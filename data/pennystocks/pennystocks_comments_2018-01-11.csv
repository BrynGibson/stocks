I can see where they need to keep raising an absurd amount of funds for this - they are absolutely burning cash - however, the fundamental premise is to use the data they collect as a tool to predict and persuade moviegoing habits. If they can get studios to sign promotional deals for films, they can use that leverage to push the theaters to allow more revenue and data sharing.

It's a weird spot to be in for sure since they're burning cash and have to rely on 8k and stock issuance for funds. 

I also think they have a big inroads to pivoting into any kind of ticketing, not just movies. They're already building the technology to do so - so maybe MoviePass is their proving ground, and they pivot into anything related to ticketing and take on Ticketmaster, etc. To me, that would be the long game and would easily make them profitable.

The result of that would be kinda catastrophic for a while since Ticketmaster invests in a shitload of concerts, physical venues - but could be very very beneficial for the user. Idk, that's kinda what I'm thinking at this point very long term.",2018-01-11
