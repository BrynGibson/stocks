XXII is holding a unique patent portfolio of methods to control nicotine levels in Tobacco plants and THC levels in MJ/Hemp.  So, applications in 3 industries:. Tobacco, Industrial Hemp, Medical MJ.

Big news from the FDA expected in the next few weeks.

ANPRM expected soon.

Previous contract manufacturing of very low nicotine (VLN) products for big name tobacco companies.

Research results due soon.

Market research in China and US show that smokers want  modified risk products.

Increased institutional ownership in the past few weeks.

This seems like a one of kind opportunity, almost too good to be true.  More experienced traders, what am I missing?  What's the downside?

Thanks in advance.",2018-02-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7y78h8/xxii_id_love_to_get_your_opinions_with_any_links/
