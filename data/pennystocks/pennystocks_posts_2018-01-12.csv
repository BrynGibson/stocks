Their new strategy is changing from acquiring mining rights to different gold &amp; silver sites to actually start mining and hopefully making money instead of sitting on assets. However it will still take a while to get the mining operations up and running.

The announcement of blockchain is likely a stock pump, but may also prove to be a good long-term investment.
