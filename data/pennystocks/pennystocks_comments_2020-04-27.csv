I am looking at your link and on page 5 there is a diagram. I think on that diagram the gold Y shape looking thing that is bound to the blue sheet is the universal antibody-modified nanocrystalline boron-doped diamond biosensor. Basically that is going to bind viral particles. This doesn't mean that it is looking for antibodies or even antigens. It is looking for coronavirus particles, such as the M protein that they are using in their figure (although that was for Influenza virus).

I get that it is really confusing, but basically let's just say.... they can detect coronavirus at a super low concentration.",2020-04-27

The call you own is a contract that allows the holder to purchase 100 shares of NAT at the price of $7/share on or before the expiration date.

If you paid 70 cents per share for this contract the price will need to be $7.70 per share at expiration for you to sell it at profit.

Currently NAT is $7.55, which means the inherent value of your option is 0.55. The rest is speculative value.

In addition, there are plenty of reputable companies who are simply small and their stocks are penny stocks.

You would be better off asking, why are there so many more scam stocks that are penny stocks compared to regular stocks. But that question also has a fairly obvious answer in that, its easier to scam with a low profile and value stock.

Then there were analyst calls with no analysts even present, press releases carefully worded to sound like they had come up with a magic UV light treatment, etc.  After I realized how little actual substance there is to this company, I decided I was going to bail at the earliest opportunity.

Seven days float is the amount of days (on normal volume) that the person shorting the stock would have to purchase to replace the Borrowed/shorted stock. 

If the stock suddenly starts rising the short seller may panic due to all the stock he owes. Say he shorts the stock at $1.20 as long as he can replace it at under $1.20 he is making money.

I was last in again at $1.31 waiting for next news so I could dump. Forgot to put a gtc sell at $1.95 and woke late so ended up out at $1.88.

I feel like it's been a long time since that half million tests arrived in US (supposedly), and they should be coming soon. Once those arrive it should run up again.

I'll probably buy a few thousand shares at $1.50, then add a thousand every nickel drop trip average down. Then dump again whenever the tests show.

Rinse repeat. So far it's been a nice swing trade stock. It is odd how more negative news stories are hitting now though. Like someone made a bit deal about the YouTube vid being pulled, and it ended up on an actual news site (podunk nowhere site, so who knows).

I just hope the younglings don't hold long term in hopes of a huge pay day. Sure, it could come... But easier profit just swinging it on the news and lack of news...

My goal is thirty to forty cents from my next buy. Or, news pops today or tomorrow and I miss out... Rather take bits of profit though...

Good luck on your next entry!",2020-04-27

Normally it may bounce off the bottom band and when it crosses above the mid line is where you would want to buy typically. However! It seems like it it could go either direction as it is consolidating hard and following a slight downward trending mid line on the 1m instead of bouncing around. I would wait for it to bounce and cross the mid line or get nearer to .8 which is what the 5m bands are showing. I think it will drop hard soon though and would be very surprised if it jumps above .9 WITHOUT a short sell off first.,2020-04-27

UAVS drones are used to survey large swaths of land, so if this wholesaler they are partnering with is intending to use drones as a delivery service, perhaps UAVS technology is helpful from a ""scouting"" standpoint. So maybe UAVS drone surveys and maps an area for the ""delivery drone"" to then navigate to execute the delivery? They have a whole page on their website devoted to ""precision farming.""

Or, maybe, just as you said, they are using certain components that UAVS uses in their drones and combing their technologies. 

I used to fly commercial quadcopters for a living. I'm not too familiar with the fixed wing drones, but I'm also wondering if these have lighter airspace restrictions since they are used for agriculture. If that's the case, they could cover more land faster than a quad or an octo copter could. I'm also curious how their flight life is compared to a copter. I'll have to do some DD on that.

&gt;Barrett Mooney, chief executive officer of AgEagle, stated, ""Over the past year, there has been a surge of prominent companies, including *Alphabet (Google), FedEx, Intel, Qualcomm, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Alibaba, UPS, 7-Eleven, Uber* and many others, actively developing commercial drone-delivery service initiatives as part of their long-term strategic plans. These companies intend to leverage the latest in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies to deliver food, consumer products, medicines and other types of lightweight freight direct to consumers and businesses in the fastest, most cost efficient and environmentally responsible manner possible - a practical alternative to costly auto transport.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""We have received our first *purchase orders to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry goods in urban and suburban areas*. We look forward to providing greater detail in the near future on AgEagle's plans to address the needs of this highly specialized new market and the specific role we expect to play in its ongoing development,"" continued Mooney.

The buy orders are of course cancelled at the exact right time.

But I wonder... If you held the stock and sold for a higher price would you fill their buy and force them to lose money?

1704,ShitPostGuy,forofjc,/r/pennystocks/comments/g91zqw/nancy_drew_and_the_ask_that_wouldnt_die/forofjc/,1,"No, this is just classic MM strategy. 

At one point on Wednesday, the spread was .018/bid .07/ask witch increasing volume. That’s where a MM needs to step in to close the spread and keep things liquid. As with most pink sheet companies, they didn’t have an initial position so they needed to acquire shares in order to function as a MM. 

They do this by “shaking the tree” which is increasing the ask price rapidly, to encourage retail investors to sell and take profits, then plunging the share price to encourage a panic sell off. That way they take a very large position at an average price between the two extremes. Now they have a ton of shares and can open shop for a ticker, profiting between the bid and ask spread.

The problem is some MM are dirtier than others and will manipulate prices to increase their profit. The 10k shuffle is a classic penny strategy where the will place functionally infinite bids and asks of 10,000 shares across a low-medium spread to rapidly fluctuate the price to try to get investors to sell to them before backing off and allowing really supply/demand to take over and set the price. 

That’s what I believe I was seeing this morning with the 10,000 share ask that just wouldn’t go away and the low bids that couldn’t be undercut.",2020-04-27

I don't think the oil glut is going to stop and ppl aren't going to sell loaded up VLCC with $4 barrel oil for cheap. Imo I would sit on that VLCC oil until it gets back to $40-50 a barrel flip that and your golden. 

EURN said for every $5000 increase makes their yearly extra net $115 mill. If you do the math of their fleet this is going to be some ridiculous earnings.

Renting a VLCC in Jan was $25k a day which is break even for a VLCC. But prices are charging up to $300k a day.

1790,exccord,fos2pyk,/r/pennystocks/comments/g90rn9/nat_starting_off_strong_today/fos2pyk/,1,"&gt; Bear in mind with the price of a barrel of oil being so ridiculously low (I didn’t even know it could go negative), this will have a temporary positive impact on the oil tanker industry. Oil producers are looking for places and ways to store oil because they can’t just flip a switch and stop oil production. Oil must continue to flow through pipelines. This creates a strong buy or call situation. When the oil industry recovers then these kinds of stocks will correct, most likely sharply, and create a great time to short or put. Good luck timing the peak and correction.

Its been a damn good time right now for buys and calls.  Just wish I knew about all of that...definitely dont care to risk financial ruin over that and become a poster boy for WSB.",2020-04-27
