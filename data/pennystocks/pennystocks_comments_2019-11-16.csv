There is currently another bot called u/kzreminderbot that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [this link](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&amp;subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot) to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
