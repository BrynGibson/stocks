5,Thoughts on LIGA stock,8k960k,Check_the_Register,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8k960k/thoughts_on_liga_stock/,0,0,"I've been invested with them for about 8-9 months now and am happy with the stock. If you haven't seen it I recommend checking it out.


Only concern is that its pretty much plateaued this whole month. And today it went down 18% and the volume seems to be average to me. Are they diluting the stock or is it just profit taking from older investors?


Anyone that is currently invested in it or have looked at it for a bit what are your thoughts for now? ",2018-05-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8k960k/thoughts_on_liga_stock/
