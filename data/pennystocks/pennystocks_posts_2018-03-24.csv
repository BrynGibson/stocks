0,Question about buying stocks at 0.0001,86ppci,Threadender79,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86ppci/question_about_buying_stocks_at_00001/,29,19,"Total noob here but can they even go any lower than that?  Reason being that it looks like that is the floor for all stocks I've seen.  So, if I bought say $2000 at 0.0001, all I have to do is see it go to 0.0002 and I've doubled up.  Rinse and repeat.  

Obviously someone has to buy all those shares at 0.0002, and obviously it could go to zero as well, but that's the risk I'm willing to take.  And wouldn't my buying that much stock make the price raise in an by itself?  Is this concept stupid?  Thanks.",2018-03-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86ppci/question_about_buying_stocks_at_00001/

2,Been watching ELTK for a couple days,86t7g6,Mr_Bisquits,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86t7g6/been_watching_eltk_for_a_couple_days/,3,1,"Tech companies got pretty hard this week overall, even as up as AAPL and GOOG, but I’ve seen ELTK drop hard after a week of consistent smooth growth. I’m not thinking of long term purchase here but maybe a 1-2 day flip when I expect it to bounce back up with the rest of the tech companies in the coming weeks. Especially once tariff news fades.

3,$ENRJ - $UAVS - reverse merger DD,86t1fw,Teutonicz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86t1fw/enrj_uavs_reverse_merger_dd/,10,6,"I ain't ever seen a reverse merger yet, what can yall tell me about their success rates in general compared to IPO's?

$UAVS is an agricultural drone company partenered with a software company (NASDAQ: RAVN) that enables the drone-collected data to direct the application of fertilizers/pesticides into fields with precision agriculture.

From what I've seen there is almost no way to invest in drones in the market with the exception of a military based drone company and several others on foreign markets which makes me think $UAVS will have a good shot in the medium term to build up into a strong long-term.

I was specifically wondering what kind of PR do reverse merges accompany on opening day? Is it reasonable to suspect that $UAVS will announce some big deal pre-bell?

Secondly, ENRJ was pumped and dumped over the past week, where it went up 200% and down 60% where the current price sits... so my logic is, this stock is going to be automatically HEAVILY shorted, easily 20%-40% of shares still need to be covered. It is going to be r/s 25:1 meaning it will have approximately 450k share float. with 80-160k of those shares shorted, so that adds credence to that they'd release PR to flush them out from the get go... on the other hand they may wait to release PR so it gets shorted even heavier
