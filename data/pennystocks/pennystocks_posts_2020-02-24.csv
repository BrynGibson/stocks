I've lately been researching ways in which I can make more money online and stumbled across this sub. I'm kind of nervous though on where to get started and whatnot. I've been browsing E-Trade's knowledge base and that's been helpful.

But my other issue is I don't have a lot of money. At most I'd be comfortable with putting $50 down on a stock or some stocks every paycheck. But I'm out of my element here. I'm comfortable with doing market research and whatnot and my ultimate goal is to no longer be broke as fuck. At $700 every two weeks from my full-time job that's not exactly phenomenal. Only saving grace for me is that rent is cheap for my area. 

So here I am! I'd love to make some decent side income doing this but want to get into it smart.",2020-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8jt8u/want_to_get_into_trading_looking_for_some_advice/

10,Documenting Stock Trading Journey - 2020,f8ijb3,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting_stock_trading_journey_2020/,1,23,"Back in January of 2018 I funded a Schwab account with $6,000. The primary goal of this account was to swing trade lower priced stocks ranging from $0.25 - $10/share. I have been trading for close to 10 years and my primary strategy of trading is through technical analysis. I don’t trade a lot of stocks, at max I may trade 2-3 in a week. But as most of the experienced traders know, as you trade for longer amounts of time you become more disciplined and refine your skill set as you go. So on the weekends I would screen for stocks and study charts I liked for the following week then look for entries early in the week. I stick to a strict stop loss level based off the chart or a percentage I am willing to risk and am always looking for at least a 5% gain from my entry before I consider an exit point. I also allocated roughly 25% of my account balance to each trade I made. At this time that equated to about $1,500 per trade. This strategy has worked well for me for a long time so my goal was to do this consistently and see what I can turn the starting $6,000 into. I traded throughout 2018 with the occasional couple week break here or there. By the end of February 2019 my account was over $10,000. I thought, not bad for trading sub $10 stocks and capturing 5% to 10% on most trades. There were the occasional trades that would capture more than that but I wanted to stick as close to my strategy as I could and ensure I was staying disciplined. So February 2019 comes around and I have a balance in my account of just over $10,000 so I now am allocated roughly $2,500 per trade I make. Still sticking to my strategy of having a tight stop loss, smart charting analysis, and looking for 5%-10% profit on each trade. Of course there are losses sprinkled throughout but they are far outweighed by the many wins taken throughout the year.

So then comes February 2020, looking at my account as it currently sits at $21, 327. My account growth from 2018 to 2019 was over 70% and my account growth from 2019 to 2020 was over 108%! At this point I am 2 years into this trading strategy and would like to document year three to see if I can replicate it again and get this account to 30k-40k by February 2021.

So I plan on starting next week (Feb. 24th 2020) to see what I can make of this account another year into the journey. Except this time I want to provide monthly recaps of the stocks I traded and how those trades played out and keep a running breakdown of my account balances and what stocks I am trading currently. I think it will be cool, (especially if the account goes up a good bit this year) to look back at the analysis and monthly breakdowns and see how the performance was. These first two years I haven’t really documented much or done much analysis on my account so I would love to do that this year and share it with everyone.

I do share charts and the trades I am getting into as well as when I get in the trades and at what price on my twitter account: [https://twitter.com/thebreadmakerr](https://twitter.com/thebreadmakerr) if you want to follow along and see what I am up to daily. I plan on providing weekly recaps on my twitter account and then deeper monthly recaps and sharing them on twitter. i will breakdown the wins, losses, and be as transparent as possible about my account and how it is progressing. Hopefully you enjoyed this story and want to follow along, I am excited to see how it goes! Thanks for listening!

TL;DR: Funded an account in 2018 with $6,000. Trading stocks under $10 a share and trading based off of technical analysis. Turned the $6,000 into $10,000 in year one and turned the $10,000 into $21,000 in year two. Starting year three on Monday Feb. 24th and would like to document my progress and trades I make on my Twitter account and have monthly updates on Reddit to see if I can double this $21k I am going into year three starting with.",2020-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f8ijb3/documenting_stock_trading_journey_2020/

**LPCN** up 67% and gapping after hours - this shows a strong setup for day 2 continuation tomorrow. I'd like to see continued volume in the premarket above $0.65 to confirm day 2 interest in the stock. On the daily chart, we have a gap above $1 -- this is likely the ultimate target if everything goes as planned premarket. A push towards $1 will require a break over the after hours highs of $0.775 w/ &gt; 150k volume per minute. 

**COCP** big runner today off virus news -- looking for a gap up tomorrow above $1.75 + ultimately push towards $2 magnet level. Play this one safe with smaller size.

**TOCA** held $1.90 again today - this has proved to be a key level for this stock multiple times now. I'll be watching for a similar play as we had this morning, tomorrow. We need to see the stock holding above that key level again tomorrow in the premarket (with no negative news / offering) and we can pop again at the open towards $2.50.

**CODX** needs to hold $3.70 in the premarket on any dips + see a break back over $4 with consistent volume. This one has had trouble holding gains lately, so we need to see confirmation of interest day 2.

**VXRT** swing idea looking solid, looking for a breakout + trend hold over $1.40 tomorrow or in the coming days this week. Clear R/R levels on the daily chart. Over $1.40 this has room towards the $1.80 level.

**ELGX** Really impressive bounce off lows -- look for continuation tomorrow IF $0.95 support holds and a breakout over $1.15 can run towards $1.50 on good volume.",2020-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f905mi/watchlist_225/
