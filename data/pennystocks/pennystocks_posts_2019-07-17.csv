1,$CBBT - Opinions? The Next SLS ??,cebj9k,GreenStonks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cebj9k/cbbt_opinions_the_next_sls/,3,13,"CBBT has been trading sideways with recent peaks. 

They have a patent pending for a device for Alzheimer's disease which is supposed to be going to clinical testing. The Price has been gaining traction since May or so, and it trades at roughly 20 M volume on average. Price is 0.0008 and has moved as high as 0.0014 this Thursday past. 

I think someone is front loading or insider trading might be happening as I have not seen recent news since the patent news in December. I feel that something is going to happen. Sentiment on ihub seems really positive and otcmarkets has no negative warnings.

Here is an ihub post suggesting they think the price will run to 0.01, [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=149544604](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=149544604)

and i always take that with salt as potential pump and dump!

However, this link : [https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read\_msg.aspx?message\_id=149870630](https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=149870630) shows a graph where the price has entered into consolidation and is having some bounces. 

I think all this stock needs is news to break (which i think it will soon) and people are going to pop this like SLS, FCEL, etc. Need you input, please DD as I am still looking up as much as I can to decide my strat!",2019-07-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cebj9k/cbbt_opinions_the_next_sls/

It's extra money so not a big deal if it ends up lost, but would be nice to give her a retirement suprise in 5 years! I don't know a ton about stocks, I use Motley Fool for myself and have done pretty well, but those are too spendy for what I'm looking for. My choice for myself was SNMN and ECSIF, haha, I'd like to use someone else's guess this time, mine not so great!
