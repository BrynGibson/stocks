""Around the world, authorities are turning to drones in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, using them to **enforce lockdowns and disinfect urban areas**. With dozens of cities in lockdown, the technology has become an important tool in keeping people off the streets.""  


Vislink has substantial knowledge in this field and signed several contracts with government agencies for drone solutions.

In November 2019, Vislink announced that it had been “[Selected to Supply California Law Enforcement Agency with U.S.-Designed and Manufactured Drone Solution](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-selected-to-supply-california-law-enforcement-agency-with-u-s-designed-and-manufactured-drone-solution/)“.

&gt;*“Vislink was selected primarily based on having the only drone-based video transmission system proven interoperable with existing state and local law enforcement agency fixed and rotary-wing aircraft currently operating in the surrounding region. The inclusion of the MicroLite 3 in the solution was driven by its compact form factor and ability to securely transmit high-quality live video images.”*  
*“We continue to be a technology leader whose downlink solutions answer the needs of today’s law enforcement organizations,” said John Procacci, Vice President of Sales for Vislink Technologies. “Providing systems that support inter-agency coordination has always been one of our key strengths. Police and military agencies are increasing their use of drones in their operations. The MicroLite 3 is a natural fit for the growing numbers of drone-based military, law enforcement and commercial applications, and it opens the door for us to explore new opportunities in these areas.”*

&amp;#x200B;

On November 11, 2019, Vislink announced the renewal of three-year service contracts with **twelve UK Police Forces** for its Airborne Data Link (ADL) infrastructure. The company further said that “there is also the potential for purchases of upgrades to installed ground infrastructure, as Vislink incorporates new technologies that increase capabilities for the police forces. This includes deployment of the Vislink TSM-2020 video aggregator. The TSM-2020 allows the onward transmission of airborne data to tactical ground forces deployed with smartphones and tablets over 4G and coming 5G networks.”

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware of Vislink's history, but I see substantial upside if they announce another government contract during the current pandemic. Their last offering was at 0.22!",2020-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fvd3ys/visl_overlooked_coronavirus_drone_play_trading_at/

Not related to penny stocks but took me a solid few days to figure out the code and figured you guys would enjoy the data. But you can tell it’s somehow related because healthcare has a bunch and so does energy. But you can see that technology and consumer cyclical have more hype which makes sense because people are buying entertainment and food. Because they have nothing else to do. Also this is for 4/3 specifically I can do it for 4/6 when that rolls around if you guys want.",2020-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fv8m5s/i_sorted_out_stocks_by_how_much_hype_theyve/

There are also a couple others LGNYZ LGNXY, but what needs to happen to the main stock for these to go up? Do these act the same as regular penny stocks on the OTC or do they only go up/down based on the main LGND? Also what is the difference between the three different CVR’s?
