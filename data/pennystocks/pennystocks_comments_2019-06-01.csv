At no point do i consider this to be altruistic or even slightly “correct”, this is just exactly what I would do, with no merit or accolades to back up my 2 cent opinion:

* if a going rate of $0.16/share can be locked in, I would sell 466,666 shares. This would net back ~$75,000, covering my ass should things not work out &amp; enough to call it a good profit. I would stash this money away and not eyeball it unless things look hairy.

* the previous sale will leave the position at 1,200,000 shares. This is still an extremely large position that will result in profit beyond my wildest dream should this thing go to $3.

We live in a 50/50 world at the end of the day. Either an outcome happens or it doesn’t. There’s literal millions of different approaches  to handle this but the way I would choose to logically break it down leads me to 2 paths.

Anyways, I thought I was fucking Gordon Gekko himself. I turned $9500  into almost 40k! 
Who would have thought 10 years later it would have hit $ 7.50? At that price my shares would be worth $675,000. ):

You already won.  You ought to walk away while the going gets good.

Let's be clear, putting 50k into one stock and having it go up around 5x in 1 month is a miracle.  Take the miracle.  

Most people that don't know how to walk away loses.  Then they suffer emotional consequences that make them a gambler.

Let's be objective, you're asking internet strangers to see if you would cash out on a miracle or not.  And then you feel like an idiot when people tell you to cash out.

You're already emotionally compromised.  You're an introvert.  You're sensitive to what people say.  You're trying to find any sort of evidence that this COULD go up to $3.  Like a gambler.

That's not good.  That means you don't have a profit objective.  You don't feel like you won already.  But I'm telling you, you already won.  This is an insane amount of return.

Or you could just do the top comment suggest, sell some and let the rest ride.  Maybe you got some ""inside"" info.  Maybe you do have an uncanny advantage.  But if it were me, I would still sell.  The gain is unbelievably good, and I would be jumping with Irish joy if I made that return even if I only put $1,000 in.

1) sell half, let the rest ride. It hits $1 or $2, you panic and sell the rest. Result: huge profit. On the other hand it could drop down to $0.06, but you still come out ahead on both halves.

2) sell it all now. You've made over 4x your money in profit. You capitalize on your good luck and use the profit for stable investing, like S&amp;P500 or dividend stocks.

3) don't sell and hope it continues on a rocketship. First result, it hits $0.17 and then crashes to 0.09. You feel foolish for not taking profit at a better level. Result 2, the magic stock market fairy decides your wildest dream has come true and you ride your lottery ticket of dumb luck to Pluto and beyond. You can buy everything you want and you can retire.

Also you might want to consider why you bought into this stock in the first place. Is it possible you got in at the perfect time because someone else said it would go up? If so, it's highly likely that the bubble you're sitting on will pop, and the guy telling people to buy shares makes a lot of money because people followed him for no reason.

Things like 0.03 -&gt; $3 do happen, but usually they're cases of massive fraud and then combined with market hysteria and the exchanges being slow to halt it for investigation. I saw DRYS go from something like $6 to over $100 (or was it $200?) in 2 days. The second day it was halting like crazy. Then it closed for investigation, when it opened long enough for people to sell it was at something like 40. Most people didn't get in under 40. I completely stayed out of it because every time it crossed another $10 I felt it was already too overdone. When the bubble pop is imminent but it doesn't pop, it's pretty phenomenal. I haven't seen anything like it since.

Well actually I lied. There were one or two sympathy bubbles in related shipping stocks a day or two later. I made about 50% on overnight shares. I sold at open. It went up for 30 seconds and then crashed hard.",2019-06-01

If you take out $150,000, you’ll still have $116,000 in the stock. You’ll be profiting $100,000 overall and you’ll be playing on the houses money. 

If you keep $116,000 in the stock and it goes to $3 like you think, you’ll make $2.175mil. If you keep all $266,000 in and it goes up like you think, you’ll make about $5mil. 

So here’s my thinking: if you take out $150,000, you get your initial investment back plus $100,000. If it goes up, then you make $2+mil. If it goes down, you don’t actually lose any of your money. You’re still up $100,000. If you keep it all in, you could make $5+mil. If it goes down, you’re out $50,000.

I have some RGSE shares left in my Robinhood account from before they delisted from NASDAQ. Now it will only allow me to sell them, I couldn't average down when it bottomed at .07. 

All PV products have some components from China yes. Although I bought one of the PH 3.0 systems in April and it says Made in USA on every single package. All of the electronic peripherals were made in USA as well. 

California recently mandated that all new construction residences be built with PV. The product is being embraced by HOA's that dont like the look of traditional panels. Also ,it is a way to prepare for wildfires for those in areas prone. Utilities have a hard time restoring services so residents need to be self reliant. 

Downside is the initial cost if the product, especially with tax incentives tapering down. Also, some cities and utilities charge insane permitting fees. It is a hard demographic to reach.
