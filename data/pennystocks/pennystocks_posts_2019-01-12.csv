0,What type account to open?,af9q1m,Mystic68,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/af9q1m/what_type_account_to_open/,1,13,"Hello I recently began the setup for an IB account. However as a student I don't have the income of 40,000 it asks for or the 20,000+ liquid net worth necessary to trade. I mostly would like to start of small and maybe try paper trading as I learn and gain more experience. I do have a regular income that I make and am saving up in order to slowly learn penny stock trading. Is there a way to go around this or should I open a cash account (which also requires a 20,000 worth). Any help would be appreciated.
