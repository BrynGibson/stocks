Earth Science Tech, Inc. (ETST) Orders First Commercial Production Run of Hygee™ Kits

Launch of new medical device to fight STIs slated for early 2019

DORAL, Florida, Dec. 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST) (“ETST"" or the “Company""), an innovative biotech company focused on the cannabidiol (CBD), nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields, medical devices, and research and development, today announces the production of the first commercial production run of Hygee™, its new, original medical device to fight sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The official launch is scheduled for early 2019.

After numerous partnerships, tests, distribution agreements and prepping, ETST has officially ordered a first production run of Hygee™. Initial marketing will target North America, South America, Asia and Africa, and the Company will package Hygee™ in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese and Arabic to reach an wide audience of consumers.  These languages are mother tongues for 1.5 billion people, with many other ethnic groups using English as a second language. By offering Hygee™ in different languages, ETST can reach the majority of individuals globally, as well as those in the Company’s current agreed distribution network, shared in November.

The Hygee™ self-sampling kit includes a discreet, wearable medical device that enables a woman to anonymously test for STIs such as chlamydia. Testing for this disease is particularly important for pregnant women, who must be screened for chlamydia infections to minimize the risk of transmission of the infection to their babies during childbirth. In any given year, approximately 8 million women give birth in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Morocco, Djibouti, and Vietnam where Hygee™ will first be offered.

While this niche represents a considerable market for the Hygee™ medical device, opportunity exists well beyond pregnant women. The World Health Organization recommends that all sexually active women aged 15 to 25 get tested yearly for chlamydia, representing a market of about 500 million women worldwide.

Dr. Michel Aube, ETST’s CEO and chief science officer, states, “No other existing method of collecting genital specimens from women is more convenient or more efficient than Hygee™. Through intentional design, Hygee™ is a ‘mistake proof’ medical device with extremely simple instructions that allow any woman, regardless of age or education the assurance of correctly using the kit on the first try.  With roughly 130 million new chlamydia cases diagnosed yearly, according to the WHO, Hygee™ is dedicated to this area of women’s health.”

ETST’s projections for Hygee™ anticipate strong sales growth in years two and three after product launch. As soon as year one, sales of Hygee™ and the associated in vitro molecular diagnoses should reach between $1.5 million and $2.5 million USD. Second year sales should reach $1 million monthly and up to $20 million yearly as early as the third year. These numbers are supported by the fact that chlamydia is a global issue; that the company’s network of distributors is worldwide; and that the thin structure of the device and the stability of the specimen collected with Hygee™ ensures that it can be easily dispersed on all continents.   

“We believe that ETST has developed the best tool on the market to fight STIs, which will provide an exceptional service to women who use Hygee™,”  states Nickolas S. Tabraue, the company’s president, director, and chairman. “The production of the first batch of Hygee™ is very exciting. Our team believed in the success of Hygee™ from the first day we acquired it. Now, we will do everything possible to spread this fabulous medical device everywhere on the planet to protect women and their future babies from the terrible, adverse effects of chlamydia and other STIs.”

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Northsight Capital, Inc** (OTCQB: NCAP) today announced that the company has launched its new enhanced Cannabis careers web site, [www.420Careers.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zEEP34S3-URSmq45bGPLxOtCs7DVI3yjc198WWC54Rn5o2hbtmNZ2jSffI3AgAxM3s-ZEsxsU5zDzIxSmMt14hR72gSqqg02fdH6NrZWKBY=) . The site, first launched in 2010 is considered one of the leading career sites in the Cannabis space. The site has been updated with many new more user-friendly features making it easier for job seekers to post their resume’s and employers to access them.  


The 420Careers site also has geotargeting. Geotargeting helps businesses determine the geographic location of someone visiting a website and then allows them to deliver various content to that visitor based on their location. It will enable companies to pinpoint data such as country, region/state, city, metro code/zip code, organization, IP address, ISP, and other criteria.  Businesses servicing the Cannabis industry currently face many regulatory hurdles as well as increased competition. State laws require dispensaries to keep their marketing efforts within their state's borders and within the age limit for sale of their products to minors. Geotargeting eliminates that problem.

Northsight also recently announced that the company has entered the legal CBD market with an agreement to be a distributor of CBD oils for SeniorsCBD, a product of SeniorsForCBD.  [www.SeniorsForCBD.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AsbBDS6-C02yMMsid1jrrXbwHu5KcU_CzycXTVJBeqlJdTYs4GrlOEnBO0II7zeDKLWTHZ5xFvLg_LUXJxsJri3Fjakg3WTl_DqZj4PWnnQ=) Seniors are currently considered to be the primary purchasers of CBD, in many instances using CBD to replace their dependence on opioids and other pain medication. The company plans to launch its first CBD products in early 2019 and is in discussions with sub-distributors.

15,I have done a bit of foot work for you all (PHGI.CN),a7fmuw,justbeaguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a7fmuw/i_have_done_a_bit_of_foot_work_for_you_all_phgicn/,1,0,"I've gone to two different Canadian pharmacies (Shoppers drug Mart, Walmart) and asked three pharmacist/techs the same questions:

1) if medical cannabis became legal right now, on a scale of 1 to 10 how confident would you be in your abilities to explain patients bringing you prescriptions on how to use it properly and safely.

1 (asain male pharmacist, early 40s appearance) said confident at all, 0.

1 (Asian male pharmacist,  late 40s appearance) said they were unsure but could google it, feeling a 3.

1 (European female tech, mid 20s appearance) said they were very confident, and could google it, around a 7.

I then asked them ""when your pharmacy introduces new products do they offer the training on their own or do they send you out/modular training"".

All three stated the training comes from the head office, and is either outsourced to another company or is done with online modules. the Walmart pharmacist told me when a new product is introduced to the market, a third party comes in to educate them in the stores, after educating the company on the top level. 


I then ask them what they expect to happen with medical cannabis and training:

All three said they fully expect the training to come down from the top, and in their opinion it will probably be a third party doing the training who is a lot more experience in it. 


What does all of this mean? Absolutely nothing other than I like to invest in companies like PHGI who do all of the hard work, and end up getting contracted to places like Walmart.

If Walmart can contract out the education, the liability for malpractice does not fall on them in any way. If something goes wrong, PHGI and individual pharmacists are to blame.
