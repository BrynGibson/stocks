Why? Why do you think it's gonna bounce? There's 3 vague comments in this thread so far all saying ""Yup, picked up 75,000 shares me self."" And""yup, it'll run""

What the eff are you guys talking about?

This literally sounds like a Discord group is all commenting on a post to pump the stock. If you can't post DD or TA or any real reason to buy shares, I would warn everyone to think twice about buying 1k+ shares and being left to hold the bag if I'm right.

If someone can prove me wrong before the bounce, please do so. If it bounces later for a significant enough time for people on this sub to make a profit too, you can all /u/ me and say ""I told you so""

But answering ""Company is shit tho why will it bounce?"" With.  ""Technicals brah.""

That means nothing to me and I'll be happy sitting this one out and taking a light ""haha, ya missed out loser!"" If it actually pumps for real rather than what seems orchestrated.",2019-06-22
