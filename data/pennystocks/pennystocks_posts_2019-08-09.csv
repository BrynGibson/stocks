13,$PTAM Updates coming as per CEO/Company. Merger announcement. Check this out... SHELL sold!,co2ybb,Shelby_Picks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/co2ybb/ptam_updates_coming_as_per_ceocompany_merger/,4,2,"Its officially sold, check it out.  [http://www.minamargroup.com](http://www.minamargroup.com/) 

For those that don't know, Mina Mar does OTC mergers. 

In the Aurora Discord room someone figured out that a green energy company - [Potash America Corp (OTC:PTAM)](https://potashamerica.net/who-we-are/) \- is entering the cannabis sector with some type of acquisition of merger. The CEO literally just released a filing that shows he now owns over 80% of the outstanding common shares of the company, and they just added a new section to their website that talks about Cannabis, and actively pursuing companies to invest in. This could be very big if it pans out.

Here is the report from this morning.

[http://equitybulletin.com/2019/07/renewable-energy-company-entering-cannabis-sector-receives-rare-5-star-technical-rating-from-fnw/](http://equitybulletin.com/2019/07/renewable-energy-company-entering-cannabis-sector-receives-rare-5-star-technical-rating-from-fnw/)

I found this most interesting actually...

&gt;As of March 31, 2019, the Company announced it has no warrants outstanding with no stock options outstanding. This allows the company to move with technical perimeters, unlike most OTC companies that are restricted based on the number of warrants, stock options outstanding, and toxic notes. PTAM has a clean balance sheet, which makes it able to trade freely.",2019-08-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/co2ybb/ptam_updates_coming_as_per_ceocompany_merger/
