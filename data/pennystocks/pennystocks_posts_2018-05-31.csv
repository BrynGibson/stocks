1,Please advise on wash sales,8njh1w,GoldenJoe24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8njh1w/please_advise_on_wash_sales/,4,2,"I have stock XYZ that is currently $0.06. Two years ago I purchased 100,000 shares at $0.10. Two weeks ago I purchased 40,000 shares at $0.04. Now, from what I've read, any shares that I buy within 30 days (before or after) of a short sale counts against those shares. But I'm not clear on the relationship between short and long shares. If I sell 40,000 of the long shares that I bought at $0.10, does it count as a wash since I sold long, despite having bought 40,000 shares two weeks ago?",2018-05-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8njh1w/please_advise_on_wash_sales/
