33,truthlesshunter,fegjefz,/r/pennystocks/comments/eoxl0w/question_for_canadians/fegjefz/,1,"Most of our banks are good to trade with. Scotia, TD, RBC are very good, albeit slightly more expensive than things like questrade. The thing is that you have direct access to your money at all times, so that helps. Also, they have promos that can give you a similar or lower fees (e.g. if you trade over a certain amount per month/quarter, the fees are the same as questrade, promotions with your bank account, etc.).  
      
I was 99% sure that you couldn't trade OTC in a TFSA. Maybe that varies bank by bank? I know of two banks and you can't trade OTC through your TFSA because of the higher likeliness of scams. Anything you trade in a TFSA does not have tax implication (hence tax free savings...)   
     
An OTC stock is a stock listed on the OTC. The OTC is just a difference market. Just like NASDAQ, NYSE, TSX, etc. OTC has much looser regulations and they are much cheaper so you have more startups and also more ""scams"" on there where the company just tries to drain whatever they can from investors. OTC has different levels (OTCQX, OTCQB, Pinks, which has its own levels as well, etc.) depending if the company is late with their filings, missing documentation, etc.",2020-01-15

Very low operating cost/lb (about $1.21/lb) of copper produced.  Current copper price at about $2.82/lb, so you can see the profit potential.  Expect worldwide copper prices to increase in mid/long-term due to electical vehicle, renewable energy, and infrastructure build out.  Strong, reliable management; high IRR; well over 60% insider ownership of total shares.  Production output scheduled for 3 stages, Phase I being 25 million lbs/year.

I’ve been in on this one since September at $0.22. 

I know they say not to go long with Penny stocks and, so far, my experience has matched that notion with any others stocks I’ve played with. 

However, this one has been a long, slow, mostly-stable burn that’s increased in value very consistently over the last several months. 

You never know, I could wake up tomorrow and find it worthless, but I feel good about it. 

Plenty of cash through 2021, trial approvals, more news coming through the pipeline, and rumored partnerships (supposedly with Merck, but who knows?). 

Currently sitting at $1.21/share. I’d love to see it around $3, but I’ll probably sell most of it off around $2 if it gets to that point without any more news of partnerships.

i figured id collect the premium and buy shares and then sell calls after the drug update.
