I’ve been searching up and down Twitter. No verified date for PR. All the big hitters have been saying mid May for weeks now. Mid May could mean this week or next week. This sub will most certainly blow up once there’s a confirmed date.

Anticipation for PR should hopefully give the stock a nice steady increase in the meantime.

Their official website only says May 2020, so it could be any day. Isn’t the anticipation fun though?

“The Company’s manufacturing partner is completing the packaging, release and shipment of Consensi™ to Kitov’s marketing partners, that is expected to begin selling Consensi™ in the U.S. in May 2020.”

“Kitov expects to receive between $28 million and $36 million in milestone and royalty revenues from 2020 through 2022.”

This causes the price to drop momentarily, giving you the chance to get in at a more reasonable price than if you tried to rush in during premarket or right at open. The only risk is the price taking off and staying up without letting you get in, but the SAFE way to get in is wait for that dip they create.

Yes there is also the option I lose more but so far over time I have always been able to recoup my losses. I'm up a few hundred percent over the last year or so. I've looked back at old stocks I've lost on and sold and 99 percent of them continued to drop and I made the right move by getting out.

I’m not married to DFFN. I just wanted folks to make money. I have done so. But the higher the price gets the higher the risk with all the warrants outstanding. And we have roughly 7 months or so before they run out of money. Fundraising will happen. The question is “is DFFN going to raise money by pricing warrants that will come back to bite shareholders later or are they going to compete offerings?” Likely both. And now that we’ve answered that we need to ask “when will DFFN raise money?” One would think they would raise money after the FDA announcement. After all they stand to make more. But what if someone attempts to exercise a warrant immediately after the FDA announcement? Will DFFN want to complete an offering before that? I’d say the chance is moderate. However If they announce FDA approval of the ARDS trial I would close out my position and be happy with what I got. Fund raising will happen after that or someone is going to exercise a warrant. That will be a good time to get back in. Circumstances pending of course!

I dont really bother looking at stocks that have pumped like 20%+ because odds are I've missed my chance at a good entry, or by that time I'd probably see it here. (If I'm bored I'll check those ones out though) I like to stick to ones that are 10% up and under. I click on all of those and first look at the volume.

""We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name Verve Ventures, Inc. On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to American Strategic Minerals Corporation and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. In June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In October 2012, we discontinued our real estate business when our former CEO joined the firm and we commenced our IP licensing operations, at which time the Company’s name was changed to Marathon Patent Group, Inc. On November 1, 2017, we entered into a merger agreement with Global Bit Ventures, Inc. (“GBV”), which is focused on mining digital assets. We purchased cryptocurrency mining machines and established a data center in Canada to mine digital assets. We intend to expand its activities in the mining of new digital assets, while at the same time harvesting the value of our remaining IP assets.""

For the fourth quarter, the company announced total revenue was $30,535,000 compared to $23,379,000 a year ago. They smashed earnings this quarter- Expected EPS: -$0.21 Actual EPS:-$0.14 
Here's the Earnings Call Transcript: https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/05/07/sprout-social-spt-q1-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx

Revenue is forecast to grow faster than the US market- They've also been debt free for the past 5 years.

I'm also loving the cup shape of the chart right now, especially following the 52-week high they hit Friday. I am holding this stock for 1-4 weeks. There's more to this in regards to coronavirus success businesses. The volume on it is low right now and I have strong suspicion it's going to pick up. I'm expecting the share price to dip about 30% and then spike to another 52 week high. TA says this is looking bullish. Got a second opinion from my broker and he's excited about this one too.

I’m not sure what makes Eric Wold an expert on this. He’s speculating based on some rumors. It was a great in and out opportunity. I made $1500 today premarket. Now if more information in the future is revealed that increases the merit of a merger, count me in.

I just wouldn’t base my investment strategy in the long term based off the rumors of one article that was blown out of proportion.

AMC is a dying business that makes money on concessions. AMC has $4.7 bil in debt. Patronage has been on the decline since before covid-19. I don’t see patronage returning to what it was before covid-19, let alone higher.

Here’s an article with the opinion that a merger doesn’t make sense: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-05-11/amazon-amc-deal-makes-less-sense-than-buying-a-studio

2977,EducationalArugula96,fquaelj,/r/pennystocks/comments/ghopp9/ogi_sure_tanked_it_hit_its_lowest_low_again_thus/fquaelj/,1,"Cannabis market as a whole is slumped in general for multiple reasons.

Massive levels of oversupply, because the big guys like CGC, CRON and ACB have focused on output capacity. Now they’ve achieved said capacity, and the market is way oversupplied. This of course brings down average price of your product, leaving many companies screwed.
Plus, the retail market in Canada is mostly undeveloped. There are clubs/stores of course, but overall saturation to the market is low currently, and concentrated in certain areas.
Market overvalues big players and undervalues smaller companies

Plenty of growth to be had in the future, but what that has signaled to me is to buy the most efficient, well-run company, with good leadership.
That’s hands down OGI. Everything they’ve done is calculated. They boast the lowest cultivation cost because of their three tier growing system which benefits them in way of lower overall overhead than competitors. They also have not focused on output, but quality. They have tried to produce premium brands, instead of focusing on growing the most weed possible. This can only benefit them in the long term. Plus, OGI’s leadership is top notch. If you’re the type of investor who really values the executive team being open and honest about the company’s challenges and upsides, again OGI is still a great choice. OGI was the first company to sound alarm that the next year of earnings for cannabis companies is going to be extremely inconsistent. Like big “surprises” up and down, OGI said it’s not possible for retail to be consistent with level of supply being pumped currently

What I see happening: over the next few years you see a huge consolidation occur in the Canadian cannabis market, as big players continue to burn through cash at crazy levels. Some will go out, some will get bought. But there simply isn’t enough room for all of them to survive and expand.",2020-05-11

3031,yourfavbrownguyy,fq96re0,/r/pennystocks/comments/ghjnjo/microsoft_buying_microvisionlooks_like_its/fq96re0/,1,"I don’t believe it. Classic pump and dump trend similar to UAVS x AMZN which took place a few weeks ago. 

This website seems like one that churns out articles for the traffic and banks on CPM ad $. Wouldn’t be surprised if people pay the site to write certain articles. If you look at the rest of the contents the topics are allll over the place including CBD, password security, etc. topped off with an article about MVIS x MSFT. 

I think since the rumor hasn’t been squashed and the volume is still high some people are still trying to get the price to go up this week to make a profit. 

I just hopped out of Reddit back to his landing page for today’s watch list from Tim Sykes as he had linked to the same article you have just on a different site. I read the email right away and that link he provided was to a clickbait website but when you click on the link it was a 404 - most likely a deleted article. As I went back to get the link for reddit I just saw that Tim has now removed MVIS from his watch list. 

Full disclosure, I follow Tim Sykes just to see what he has on his watch list and if any of those Penny stocks have the potential of being pump and dump where I may be able to snag a quick 20-50% profit. I personally think Tim is more of a marketer than a trader and wouldn’t recommend to follow him. With all due respect. Whoever you follow in terms of watch lists, etc. goes without saying, always do your own DD. 

Do as you wish. I personally will stay away from it as it had already rallied over 200% this past week and for the same penny stock to do that again is less than likely. Also because the news seems like a rumor. That being said, because the rumor is still floating around it is definitely possible that the price will climb over the next day or two (prob not over 100% again) but will inevitably come back down.",2020-05-11

I started out as a greedy son of a bitch and I had 200$ profits on both LLEX AND VISL. But in didn’t sell and I’m still stuck with them 2 weeks laters. I learnt from those mistakes and now I always sell quick and I’ve been making money. Yes these guys are scam artists and yes what they are doing is wrong. But people out there will always be doing this and we can’t stop it.  So far I’ve found it more time than not, easy to make money by following these guy. Yes I have gotten screwed on 1 stock.

You say it's a **fact** that this individual is buying upvotes and using alts, but you offer no proof.  Just opinion stated as fact.

This entire sub is manipulation and pump-n-dump, so I find it curious you're singling out this one individual.  Unless . . .

&gt;  Some promoters are more cleaver. Intentionally create controversy about their stock pick.

So perhaps you're the *clever* one here.  By your logic, you must be an alt of Salm, vilifying yourself in the hopes of gaining more sheep.  Well done, Salm.  Well done.",2020-05-11

2. If you post DD with links to your supporting original source material they automatically get removed. So this encourages serious posters to leave and rocket ship posters to enter. If your post by some chance makes it it will eventually get locked down and you will notice someone close to the mods posting the exact same thing you did suddenly trending in the sub. Never fails! In any case the argument that mods don't remove posts falls flat. They remove serious threads all the time! Rocket ships get to stay.

OP, who has his face to his name so I respect that, will show results proving the frauds callouts are no more than gambling. What I suspect will be proven:

* Promoter has an influence on the price

* Longs have lopsided odds, where shorts are heavily favored

* When the promoter stops pushing the stock, the price drops

Sure it can! Figure the average trade amount per trader is 100. Meaning that some traders who copy trade with more size, some with less, but it averages out to 100 shares. 

100 * 5000 is 500,000 volume he's pumping in on average. A small minority of those buyers are profitable. After enough variations, no long, other than the promoter, will be profitable.",2020-05-11

We bulls only advantage would be the extended hour trading. Which starts a little earlier than other apps. 

TD ameritrade (thinkorswim) is just better for a more advanced trading :

1: there’s a stock simulator so you can test your theories without losing money

2. Indicators, they have a lot more customization when it comes to looking at charts

3. You can trade OTC , which you can’t on many platforms

4. Free level 2 data

5. Downloadable Desktop trading platform
