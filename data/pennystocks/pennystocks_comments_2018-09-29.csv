But within a 1 -3 cent range. Like, without fail, it seems to go up one day and drop the very next and cycled back and forth everyday.

A smart person would say no, of course, its dead in the water. However looking at the past trends of the stock this is not the first time they have dropped almost all of their value and bounced back from the grave. Does that mean it will? no. However, it will create speculation that it will which will create some nice spikes. I bet it will spike at least 10% by January or i'll eat 24 cold taco bell tacos. ",2018-09-29
