9,NormanMitis,fl6139d,/r/pennystocks/comments/fmsvg4/tomdf_new_entry_into_testing_kit_scene_look_out/fl6139d/,1,"Thanks for the heads up on $AYTU, I wasn't aware of it til now. I'm holding $TOMDF atm and though I'm a chart trader, I try to find charts I like with strong catalysts and $TOMDF fits the bill. My thoughts (mostly on the charts):

$TOMDF - There's been some heavy selling at times but the buying pressure has been constant for a couple of weeks now (and began to explode on Thurs). I think if the bulls can break through the .17 ceiling this is going to go nuts - I'm basing that purely on the amount of volume pouring in/ chart breakout pattern/ and nature of this catalyst.

$AYTU - Like I said I just now am looking at the chart for the first time but it reminds me a lot of $TOMDF in it's key elements. Huge volume backed explosive move followed up with some grinding/consolidation and an attractive breakout trigger point sitting not too far overhead. I think if $AYTU can break the ceiling in the 2.05 range then it's likely to run like crazy as well. Very similar chart and identical nature of catalyst (the type that generate panic buying).

&amp;#x200B;

Chart wise I think they're both primed, very strong overall but both are trading at short term lows after recent pullbacks. I honestly think they'll both either breakout or fail to breakout, but again that's just looking at the charts. I don't know enough to break down the merits of each company's product and their individual chances, however in cases like these I've found that it's just the promise of potential alone that sends these things flying.

$TOMDF is priced in the .10s and those tend to be more volatile (and therefore more potential upside quite often, as well as risk) than a stock trading above $1. $AYTU's market cap is almost twice as high as $TOMDF, but the devil is in the details. 

I think they're both great looking speculative plays atm, risky as heck but some strong price action/charts and crazy upside. Hard to pass those up imo. $TOMDF feels like it could be the bigger ROI at current levels, assuming both breakout, but that is far from a certainty. 

Thanks again for highlighting $AYTU, I was surprised to find a good post here. Maybe I should give the sub a chance after a bad first impression. Cheers",2020-03-22

I don't see AYTU having a market cap of BLPH. Most likely closer to CODX. Tests and treatments are like apples to oranges.

That said, comparing test with test. If AYTU captures the same market as CODX. That would be around 266M cap. For a while CODX was 17-21. After market correction, the price is currently stagnant at 10-11. Price target at around $7.20 with a short squeeze. 

Now, the speculative cases,
1. AYTU gained rights in Mexico and Canada as well. Will that means approx 3 times the market cap? Then times that by 3, PT at $21.60(do your own math with population, assumption taken- population to be the same) 
2. AYTU performs better than CODX because it can be a potential self administered test that CODX cannot be. PT yet to be determined but could take it to ALPH level.
3. AYTU only captures CO, Divides by 50. Back to 52 week low most likely.

 ADVICE TO INVESTORS NEW TO OPK:  


If  you've done your research, then you know about all the positive news  going on with OPK and its business growth and you are probably wondering  why the stock price is so low. Here's why...  
Here is the step by step as to why this stock is only $1.40  


1) You buy the stock at $1.40  
2) Big shorting companies sell a ton of shorted stocks to lower the price.  
3) Price drops to $1.20, you freak out and sell your stock.  
4) The combination of them selling their stock and you selling yours drops the price further.  
5) They buy back all the stock they sold plus yours for $1.10.  
6) They hold on to their stock until new investors come in wondering why the stock is so low and buy in.  
7) Stock price goes back up.  
8) Repeat steps 1 through 7  


The  only way to beat this cycle and see the stock rise to what analysts say  its worth (between $4-$6) and possibly much higher due to all the new  testing sites is to BUY and HOLD your stock. EXPECT them to short the  stock which will lower the price, then BUY some more, Buy doing this,  you do not let shorters buy back at a lower cost than what they sold  for. Once the risk outweighs the reward for these shorters, I promise  you they will move on. How do I know this, because investors can only  lose what they invest, but the potential for loss for a short is  unlimited. They have everything to lose AND MORE.",2020-03-22
