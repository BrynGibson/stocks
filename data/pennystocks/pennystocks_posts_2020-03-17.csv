30,Where to next for beginners?,fkds8t,itsalwaysdeniz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fkds8t/where_to_next_for_beginners/,1,12,"Hello guys. This will possibly be the millionth post that starts with the sentence ""I am new to trading""

I have been following this sub a while and have got into some interesting stocks through it. Like CPE, CHK, SWN which have been performing quite well, and I have been short selling on the go and increasing the amount I have on these papers. Then I have some shares in other oil/energy and biotech companies, which havent been performing very well, but not too bad either. My biotech papers are rather big companies like GILD, so I can see it as a long term investment too. I so idealistically, and oh well greedily too went in TSLA as well and oh my oh my. But it's all fine.

The uncertainty I am having now is.. where am I headed with the penny stocks? I will surely keep at least some a good while as their future looks if anything highly promising. But I still have a feeling that I will simply not know when to jump off the train. 

So that's why I had the urge to post this question here, to the more experienced, and who is maybe not a full-on day trader as I am not. How do you generally know when to jump off? Also, what sort of a balance do you have between your stocks? Do you only have penny stocks? Or do you generally use your gainings from these to get these so called blue chip stocks? 

I hope these aren't all non-sense questions, and I know there absolutely is no definite answer. But I am very interested and grateful to know more experienced investors' approach on these matters. Thanks y'all!!",2020-03-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fkds8t/where_to_next_for_beginners/

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

NEW YORK, March 16, 2020 -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2753212-1&amp;h=393612129&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a new vehicle order through its MEG subsidiary from rental and leasing services company Beijing Silk Road Rainbow Car Rental Group Co., Ltd., the leading bus operator in Northern China for several major metro markets, including Beijing.

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

&gt;  
&gt;Brian Cox, Chairman and CEO of Surge Holdings, commented, “We are generating significant traction in our Surge Logics subsidiary.  This is best illustrated by the fact we achieved unaudited gross revenue of nearly $1 million in January 2020, close to a ten-fold increase versus the same period last year.  This puts us at an annualized revenue run-rate in excess of $10 million within this division alone.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Carter Matzinger, President of Surge Logics, added, “The success of Surge Logics reflects our recent expansion initiatives including our investment in the development and launch of InTake Logistics, a proprietary intake management solution for law firms specializing in mass tort lawsuits. Our growth also reflects the synergies of our strategic equity stake in Centercom Global last year, which is having a sustained positive impact on our revenue.  This investment supports our ability to rapidly scale the business, as Centercom provides sales support, outbound client qualification, reporting, database programming, software development, and other various operational support services for Surge Logics. ”",2020-03-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fk81r9/surg_someone_just_slapped_ask_for_21000_in_one_go/

I can also do some simple analysis like volume breakouts, gap ups, gap downs, gainers, seasonality (if certain stocks do well a certain month. This sounds dumb, but Chinese stocks for example almost always perform worse in December because of Lunar New Year), etc.

The main site would be free with a paid option to support the work and potentially hire someone to do the analysis.

Nice!

Bio stocks are typically safer in outbreaks like this. I mean real ones, not the pump and dumps.

A few things I forgot to add to my initial [information](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/fi1giu/ogen_may_be_leaving_the_station_sunday/) and [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/fibhnv/ogen_changes_to_conferences_and_other_updates/) are that OGEN has NO debt and is fully funded through Q2 2021. Being that they are also finished with P2 and now compiling results, their expenses have almost certainly plummeted.

They are not at risk of having to shut down the study from COVID 19 concerns or infections, as other studies are, because the study is over. This is an important point because chemo/radiation patients are much more susceptible to very poor outcomes from COVID-19. An infection could have destroyed the study or made it impossible to continue. We're past that.

I almost sold half today knowing we were facing a massive drop with the futures market tanking, but I talked it over with my group, we reviewed our reasoning, and I held. I'm glad I did both. The position is solid, IMHO, and when I reviewed everything again, I couldn't find the flaw in the risk/reward of the position.

As I stated in my update, very large buys have been coming in. Another large buy came in today. We still have a belief that someone is angling for a buyout. Take that for what it's worth, which is just speculation, but it's based on the reasons previously given.

**If you can find a flaw, let us have it! We are a community!**

Don't get me wrong, I'm very apprehensive in this market being bullish on anything, but I can't find a reason to exit.

However, considering the market, I am lowering my expectations. IF this runs into results or with results, I may exit at $2+. I will definitely be using a trailing stop-loss and closely monitoring my charts.

God speed.",2020-03-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fjxr9z/ogen_still_holding_strong/
