6,$GRYN Green Hygienics Holdings Inc.’s (GRYN) Rebranded Cannagram Services a Key Platform for Growth Strategy in the Premium Cannabis Industry,9xo16c,louied91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9xo16c/gryn_green_hygienics_holdings_incs_gryn_rebranded/,1,0,"[https://www.networknewswire.com/green-hygienics-holdings-inc-s-gryn-rebranded-cannagram-services-a-key-platform-for-growth-strategy-in-the-premium-cannabis-industry/](https://www.networknewswire.com/green-hygienics-holdings-inc-s-gryn-rebranded-cannagram-services-a-key-platform-for-growth-strategy-in-the-premium-cannabis-industry/)

* Advanced financial and communications are offered by Cannagram Services to the cannabis industry; the platform is expected to position GRYN for vertical expansion and increased exposure
* Cannagram Services is one of three brands acquired in the Canna Brands Portfolio; others are Myijuana, a sales generating portal, and CoursePro Academy, an educational destination
* Long term, GRYN plans to expand its IP portfolio of brands first domestically, then globally, as a suite of products that will establish the company as a leader in the premium grade cannabis market

Green Hygienics Holdings Inc. (OTC: GRYN) eyes its rebranded Cannagram Services as a vital flagship platform for its recent trio of acquisitions, creating a catalyst for strategic growth in vertical markets. The purchase of the Canna Brands Portfolio advances its own business model and enables the company to position its brands in vertical markets ([http://nnw.fm/t8Yl1](http://nnw.fm/t8Yl1)).

Cannagram Services, CoursePro Academy and Myijuana together advance GRYN’s strategy of expanding its product sales and exposure in the full-scope premium cannabis industry, targeting the top-end medical and adult-use recreational markets. Science-driven cannabis growing methods are linked to its proprietary systems, algorithms, software and customized hardware. In a commercial environment, GRYN uses hybrid-aeroponics cultivation to produce pharmaceutical grade cannabis at a high yield and low cost.

Cannagram Services is able to concurrently offer the industry advanced communications and financial services while also extending a brand awareness platform for GRYN. It will also offer cross-portfolio resources, the company said.

CoursePro Academy creates an educational destination for the cannabis industry and provides another way for GRYN to introduce its own technologies and brands. The company sees it as an important asset.

Myijuana can create consumer sales and generate product revenue while offering a mix of content, including e-commerce, reviews and news, in a portal format. Its online Myijuana Dispensary Directory drives revenue through advertising, premium listings and reviews.

Together, these three core strategic acquisitions form an important platform that is expected to build “substantial revenues” for the company, according to Matthew Dole, SVP of business development at GRYN ([http://nnw.fm/nXDs5](http://nnw.fm/nXDs5)). He added that the company’s expanded IP platform, plus its own existing line of brands, will be used to advance its business model.
