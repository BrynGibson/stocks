THIS EXPLAINS WHY THEY COMING OUT STRONG GETTING A LOT DONT LIKE FILINGS AND SUDDENLY TWEETING AND DROPPING PR's!!!""

Read and digest Stockmoney2's words here. This is the BIG picture!!

*** Now were connecting dots.. *** 

Quoted from 22 yr Ihub Vetern ""zyx1002"" :

""Here are the facts and I will share what I have verified: 

1) Sohm has real generic drug manufacturing facility in India as many others 

2) A big % of prescription and generic drugs we buy here in USA are made in India 

3) FDA has huge staff in India and infact they have staff permanently stationed in the office of the big drug manufacturers like Ranbaxy 

4) You need licensing to make those drugs in India and bring them over which is a painstaking and long process in India and Sohm has the licensing 

5) They were selling drugs in the USA and in fact, they hosted a pre-oscar party a few years back where they gave them out as goody bags. It is well documented and I know of one big name Hollywood producer who was in that party. 

6) The generic drug market is highly competitive in USA and it is not easy to sell them here. 

7) The CEO had a heart attack in 2015 and various health complications and everything stopped 

8) Now he is back in charge and pretty much restarting the effort and have already signed some good distribution agreement 

9) Yes they have diluted some in the past but that is nothing compared to most OTC players who dilute billions of shares with no business at all. 

10) I have gotten confirmation that there is no dilution happening now or in near future. They have gotten money to operate the company and sign new distribution agreements. 

11) They may have paid themselves which every CEO of a public company does so. They have to pay their bills too. 

12) In summary, this freaking thing is trading at 0.0008 not $8 for all those shortcomings. But it is not a scam. It is a real business. 

13) Now the CEO is getting it back on track. Let us hope he is successful. 

14) It is worth at least a penny imho. ""

---- Conclusion ----

My best friend bought this at .0009 today and I feel like he already owes me a boat.. This is hands down the best triple penny play run since the BVT* run of July 17, which many will remember I spearheaded... This is it people.. All out alert to all family in friends. Buy NOW or keep eyes on this ticker!!
Umm. My first big DD packet so go easy on me.. Kinda just quoted alot but I'm happy with it. Be nice. Good luck to all. In my honest opinion.

Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH), a FinTech service provider delivering mobile banking, prepaid debit and credit and telecommunications services to underbanked and underserved communities, announced record revenue for fiscal year (FY) 2017 reaching more than $53.8 million, a more than 52-fold increase over revenue for FY2016. The gross profit for FY2017 was $2.4 million, versus a gross loss of $31,000 for FY 2016. The results for FY2017, which ended December 31, 2017, were posted in the company's most recent Form 10-K. The Company's 2018-Q1 Report on Form-10Q has also been submitted and shows revenues of $20.0 million compared to 2017-Q1 revenue of $0.5 million. Net Income before non-controlling interest for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.5 million compared to a loss of $1.7 million for the same period in 2016.

Management has been focusing on improving the health of the company and positioning for growth in underserved markets, while minimizing and retiring convertible debt. The increase in revenue is mainly attributable for several acquisitions that NXGH accomplished. The retirement of all convertible debt was a major stepping stone to improve the financial health of the company and protect its future value. In total, the Company was able to retire over $10.8 Million in debt.

NXGH's total revenue for fiscal year 2017 wasa record $53.8 million compared to $1.0 million for fiscal year 2016. This yields a 52.3 times increase in annual revenue for 2017 versus 2016. The gross profit for FY2017 was $2.4 million versus a loss of $31,000 for FY 2016.
Net loss before non-controlling interest for the year ending December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million, compared to a loss of $10.0 million for the same period of 2016.

""After several successful acquisitions, and retirement of all convertible debt, I am very pleased from the results,"" stated Arik Maimon, Founder &amp; CEO of NXGH. ""Now after our auditors have removed the Going Concern for the company on both the 10k and 10Q filings, I am extremely confident that NXGH will have a very strong future to bring significant value to its shareholders. Our Business plan has been clear since day one and now management has been proven to be able to handle any challenge along the way.""

The NXGH product portfolio called ""CUENTAS"" (launching in Q3 and Q4 of 2018), will be the first multifunctional Mobile Wallet, allowing users on a single platform to seamlessly perform a myriad of financial transactions including, but not limited to, mobile banking, international remittances, bill payments, gift card purchases, health insurance purchases and domestic and international telecommunications ""Top-Ups"", along with newly created robust Reward features.

""Our Board of Directors, executive management and the collective group has succeeded in truly remarkable acquisitions, execution and performance on our annual and quarterly profitable results. This reinforces our FinTech business model and management's plan. We are equally as excited to execute and launch the balance of our comprehensive multithreaded plan called ""CUENTAS"" for all of our customers, shareholders and employees,"" stated Michael De Prado, Founder, President &amp; COO of NXGH.

""We are very proud and excited to be a part of the NXGH Group as the growing synergy between telecommunications and financial marketplaces is becoming more of a reality and necessity,"" stated Orlando Taddeo, International CEO of Limecom, Inc.

I was reading that AKER has been granted 180 days to meet a bid price requirement of at least $1.00, and that this _might_ be done through a reverse stock split.  To me, this is a buy signal, but the fact that the founder just left, along with earnings report coming out tomorrow (?) might be a signal to short.  Can someone with more experience shed some light on this?
