While the NASDAQ and the nyse have certain requirements to be traded on them, many penny stocks actually trade through other smaller exchanges that don't have the same requirement it's whenever it comes to reporting financials and the like. I could start a company in my garage, decide to make shares of it publicly available, and trade it on some of these smaller exchanges as a penny stock. Only if I wanted to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ or some other International Market with similar requirements would I be required to produce what you are asking for. This is one of the reasons that penny stocks are so dangerous and are so susceptible to pump and dump schemes",2018-07-12
