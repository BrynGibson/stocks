*Going Concern – The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, during the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company incurred a net loss of $ $7,586,580 had negative cash flows from operating activities, had a working capital deficit of $8,109,483 and had minimal revenue-generating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In this regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans or through additional sales of equity securities. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising this additional capital or in achieving profitable operations.
