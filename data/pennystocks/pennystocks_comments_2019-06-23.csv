Cheapest pair I saw was $70 each for nothing special. No sales. Employees all just standing around. No customers. Left and walked over to Macy’s and found nicer looking pants for $35 each.

13,Bubonic67,erv5g24,/r/pennystocks/comments/c40del/jcp_jc_penny_thoughts/erv5g24/,1,Why does a new CEO automatically equal a better change in sentiment? Not trying to be a dick - genuinely curious.,2019-06-23
14,mtooth,erv75kh,/r/pennystocks/comments/c40del/jcp_jc_penny_thoughts/erv75kh/,1,"Yes that's a fair criticism; it does not automatically equate to a change in sentiment, I am definitely speculating :)

The previous CEO did a pretty poor job and was effectively removed by the board; they spent the last 6+ months with an interim CEO who obviously is a bit of a lame-duck and cannot really execute a long-term plan for the company - so there wasn't much compelling reason to own the stock.

I expect the new CEO will be able to re-capture some of that $2B in sales as earnings.  They have a bunch of lease renewals coming due in the next two years where I anticipate favorable terms given the over-supply pressure retail REITs have experienced.  The new CEO was head of merchandising at Macys and helped drive some of their online sales growth, which should be useful experience for any running any retail company these days.

This company will not be a growth machine, but it's just way oversold right now and the risk/reward profile is nice; I predict it will return to fair value $5 - $7 range by December/Jan if new CEO executes properly.",2019-06-23
15,born2rock4life,erva6oe,/r/pennystocks/comments/c40del/jcp_jc_penny_thoughts/erva6oe/,1,"Retail outlets in general are dying. Look at Ascena. Same story, after a huge impairment charge due to their inability to pivot in the age of multichannel marketing and distribution. I wouldn’t short a stock that’s already extremely low as any good news can bring it out of a tailspin and double and quadruple in a day. Don’t want to risk that kind of margin call unless you have tons of spare BP aside from the shorted shares. Even still, if you’re going to short it it’s far safer to wait until such a day occurs and wait for the first sign of a red day after it goes on a parabolic rise. Best of luck",2019-06-23
