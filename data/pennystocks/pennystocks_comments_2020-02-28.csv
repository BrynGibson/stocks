A.) Every store already carries Lactaid (lactase enzyme, the enzyme people with lactose intolerance are lacking that metabolizes dairy sugars). Take some lactase, eat your cheese, and all is well.
B.) There are a plethora of life-threatening diseases with research efforts that are either underfunded or nonexistent.

Should see some choppiness here around ~1.20 (50 day moving average). But I‚Äôm fairly confident it should be able to break. I am 100% confident we‚Äôll be firmly in the green though. Even if shorts can hold it under for a bit I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre going to regret it.,2020-02-28

They tweeted something about CV today. Was told they release case studies related to their product weekly. Going to keep a sharp eye out for it tomorrow.
