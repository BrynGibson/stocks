As long as it hold 24-25c area i think its still in play. If it were to selloff to 22-23 i think it might suggest the run today was just a head fake. 

Last time it ran to like 32c it ended in after hours and then the whole penny market sold off the next day putting the kibosh on the rally. If it were to break 30s tomorrow it would fly. 

I like their product. Unlike alot of penny stocks their product actually seems like it has a chance to make a difference and be a real disruptive tech in that stent market.

He didn't get to be a billionaire Jewish guy because he is stupid, and he makes great choices on the best kind of companies, I.e. insurance and real estate. I believe he will want this stock to make it to the NASDAQ and I believe he has the resources in one pocket to make sure it happens.

Plus, the companies he is into are already successful and hugely profitable, and bringing those into this shell is already a success. He's already made it clear this is what hei's doing. There will be no dilution coming because he already has all the money to make sure there are no toxic notes. These opps only come along once in a great while.

This is the most important PR. This says it all and shows how wise they are and how careful they are about making sure everything is done properly. This means a lot and it means that have huge plans for the future. https://www.accesswire.com/513651/Ethos-Media-Networks-Inc-EOMN-Announces-a-Change-of-Control

New management's focus will be on acquiring companies in the insurance  agency and real estate sectors, and in many cases are controlled by  companies affiliated with Reliance.

Accordingly, new management's business plan is, first, to acquire the  target business or businesses while EOMN is a non-reporting issuer;  then, when the SEC-compliant audits of the business or businesses have  been completed, they intend EOMN to become a SEC-reporting issuer again.


All this is happening according to plan- and fast.

The main thing is these need news to run. When the news runs out, they stop running. When nothing to look forward to, they stop running.  Ezra is already showing he is on top of the PR's, so that leads me to believe he will be on top of posting whatever needs to be done. I don't have a lot of faith in a lot of these stocks, but I believe Ezra will put up the money to make sure he is properly advised. Ezra is a billionaire genius. Guys like him don't buy up shells to let them sit and go to pot. He is on top of things. Plus, his CPA is his share holding partner on this, which says a lot.
