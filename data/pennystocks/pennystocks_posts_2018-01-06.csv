Chart looks great for a breakout. I'm not the smart chart guy, but I'm in a group where a super smart guy makes constant amazing and consistant plays. Stop loss at .96 to be safe, was told it will pop in 2 weeks and that he'll br buying a few thousand more shares to help it run once it hits 1.2. 



IDXG is his secone recomendation, was told go all in on both MBOT and IDXG and PTIE (60% MBOT, 30% IDXG AND 10% PTIE) 


I'm not buying IDXG yet, but heavily recomend both of them due to how good this guy is. Last call he had was SEED, where I bought at .89 and sold at 1.10. Wouldn't recomend going all in since this is a Reddit post, but buy a few hundred shares if you want some free grocery $$ if you wanna play safe.",2018-01-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ohbtb/mbot_shitty_company_good_12_week_swing/

Brown has an impressive track record with increasing share prices of companies he's been involved in. 

This mining company is in talks of diverting business to cannabis, hence a main reason I invested.  I feel this stock could move massively with no news, just the fact they are getting into cannabis.",2018-01-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ok3y5/thoughts_on_vtno/
