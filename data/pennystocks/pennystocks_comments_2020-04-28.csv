There are other good drone selling companies out there. Beside that, Amazon could just buy UAVS in an instant. Would be more profitable to them.

I work in Additive Manufacturing (3D printing), specifically medical devices and we constantly build parts for companies who don‚Äôt have a 3D printer yet or don‚Äôt have the expertise to. We build their parts and then they use them to validate and test to one day manufacture on their own once the product is tried and true. The statement also said they are still pursuing other opportunities with their expertise. Again, sounds more in line with my example above. This would only mean a small uptick in revenue that wouldn‚Äôt continue longterm. Just my two cents though. I still have 2500 shares. We can still hope! :)",2020-04-28

Once I sell, I'll use my profits to buy into penny stocks 100 shares at a time.

I think that's the future. One of these big 3 theater companies need to work w at home rentals, such as Redbox or Netflix, etc. I look for this to happen 2020-21.

Not to mention the unemployment. I think we are looking at a hover around 30 points down and here for S&amp;P until June/July. If earnings were scary for Q1 then Q2 will look like Armageddon. If the 2nd wave hits in August then the great depression will start by September.

Personally, I think it‚Äôs the time to get in on some of them. Real estate connected to commercial spaces like malls and venues will likely stay hurt, but residential spaces I think will see a faster recovery. With congress putting money directly into people‚Äôs hands through a boost in unemployment benefits and the stimulus check as well as putting in breaks for homeowners, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see nearly the foreclosures you would normally under this kind of unemployment. 

RWT, MITT, and MFA are my real estate plays. All of them were stable in their share price until 3 months ago and each took a 75-80% hit. They‚Äôre based in New York or California which are both real estate markets that will recover faster than the rest of the country. They‚Äôre not quite penny stocks, but they‚Äôre under $5 at this point and have started tracking back up. 

GNC is another I got on, once people can get back out a little, my guess is their stock jumps back up sooner than later. They were between $2-3 before pandemic. 

As for earnings, I doubt they‚Äôll have as big of an impact just because everyone expects them to be bad and everyone knows why. Earnings serve as a way to tell how the company is operating and performing, but they don‚Äôt really do that if the company wasn‚Äôt able to operate and perform. In fact, you might actually see some spikes if earnings aren‚Äôt as bad as people expect.",2020-04-28
501,rowtyde37,foxzwpo,/r/pennystocks/comments/g9yosj/stocks_to_watch_for_4292020/foxzwpo/,1,"As you can see, there are a lot of different ones people are telling you about because they have either did their DD and holding out for a quick sell, waiting for earnings/news to increase (all news increases stocks for the most part right now), or because they are long term like me and invested in companies they know have a high PVE even 3 months ago 

This is a warning, however. You'll see what they suggest, but also read the ones telling you about their losses or bag holding. I bag held USO after big talks and a potential for an OIL WEEK and lost about 20% of my portfolio between USO and IBIO because the point of a penny stock isn't to hold it for a month. That's where chart reading is important. 

And again, profit margin. If you don't plan to have thousands of shares in a penny stock and selling immediately, then take the long term route and buy smaller shares of $10-$20 stocks with FVE of 3 to 4 times more than you're paying. But do it for the right stocks. And keep an eye on the FVE in case it drops.

Prior to the Covid-19 panic, the UVA technology AYTU was ""developing"" was an intracolonic catheter that could possibly kill bad bacteria in the gut and intestines but without hurting the tissue. However, they based this off of models and have not performed any significant tests, at least none that have been published. In fact, the researchers only just published their first proof-of-concept study in October of 2019 in the United European Gastroenterology Journal. Again, this treatment has not been independently tested, studied, or verified.

Fast forward to the pandemic. AYTU implies this same untested and unverified treatment could also work on Covid-19 by injecting a device, not in the anus, but in the throat, and for the purpose of killing, not bacteria, but a novel virus that we still don't fully understand. Not only that, but AYTU is selling this as fact to drive up their stock, which is exactly why their videos have been pulled.

But, let's assume for a moment that the treatment works. It's still years away from working because it needs clinical testing and verification.

The 8k released aftermarket concerning the Board of Directors change was a necessary formality, paying off the last Director/Chairman, and replacing him with Brian Conway. Not much more to say about that. 

I would agree about the DPAs, and actually think this volume, despite the aggressive dilution, is extremely hopeful. We have so many buys, and so many eyes, OZSC is definitely showing up on a few scanners. Once DPA is signed, we will see that volume reflected in the pps, as diluters won't be taking advantage. I will be making another post on this shortly.",2020-04-28

Yes, at first I was surprised and disappointed by the significant dilution and price drop today.  But I think you're correct; the final lenders seem to be getting in as much dilution as possible before the DPAs are all finalized.  So overall my outlook is also still positive, I bought more on the dip today.

This is what Brets Chilcott bio says on the AGEagle site...

""Prior to AgEagle, Bret was the Founder and CEO of Solutions by Chilcott, whose proprietary manufacturing processes paved the way to the initial AgEagle fixed wing design.  He also served as Vice President of Business Development for First Source Composites where he spent nearly eight years leading commercial and government sales for the industrial composite parts manufacturing company.

""A  niche that we serve is carbon fiber infused components. They are foam-cored encapsulated in various layers of carbon fiber.  This process creates components that are very light but yet very strong.

Anyways, the option will become illiquid. It is really hard to sell a contract for 12 shares. So you can't exit after the split.

Now the question is, do you think USO will rise in the next 2 years? I personally think, there is very little chance, that we will get a backwardation situation. So USO is just going downhill from here. 

So best you could do is exit as soon as possible and never touch USO again. If you are lucky, the bid ask spreads on the option are still reasonable early in the day. So you could cut your losses.",2020-04-28

Quick recap: 

* This company has been busy for the last 10 years doing R&amp;D, lead by an apparently highly skilled  Founder/CEO and a quality team.  
* Last year they signed their first few deals in the touring industry, including international sales. 
* Late last year they sold their first model to a customer (the CEO's Mom) and have since sold a few more. 
* They have over 4,000 pre-orders, held by deposit
* They launched, in March, two new products: a Deliverator and a Rapid Response machine. 
* The Rapid Response machine is currently active in a pilot program, used by Eugene Fire Department (hometown of Arcimoto)
* The stock hit it's all-time lowest value the same day they announced plant closures due to the virus: $0.96
* [2019 Earnings Report](https://app.greenrope.com/c1.pl?63dcd14900d57955512845242285ced0ae41f5477d268a44)
* [2019 Earnings Video](https://youtu.be/I6AhDVCkDFg): recap
   * Met all goals except for manufacturing capacity (in-part due to closing plant in response to COVID-19)
   * Ready to meet all capacity needs now with 4000 presales
   * Goal is to land a major wholesale deal, which would lower the MSRP of personal-use vehicles
   * Penned pilot program w/ ""major national grocery chain"" with the deliverator. (the biggest news, imo)
* Since the earnings release:
   * [Applied for a $30M Federal Loan on April 15](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2020/04/15/arcimoto-using-coronavirus-shutdown-to-prep-30m.html)

My plan? I rode the wave on this think a couple of times...but then missed out on the biggest single-day earnings. I am back in now @ $2.11 and plan to continue dumping money into this think until huge news releases later this year or the company completely fails.

But actually I do see the deliverator being something that universities would buy, because they always want something that is small to go around campus with.

The rapid responder seems identical to the first one lol, but I do see the potential application.

Overall seems like a pretty cool product, but the masses aren't going to buy this as a everyday car so the market is somewhat smaller.

What is different about an OTC stock is that since they‚Äôre not part of a major exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ), they‚Äôre not required to submit financials for vetting.  This saves coMpanies who sell OTC stock a pile of money in documentation prep and auditing.  Have you noticed even Nintendo is OTC.  While it‚Äôs important to perform your DD for any stock,  with OTC stock there‚Äôs more RISK, so it‚Äôs good to keep an eye on it if you‚Äôre heavily invested but nothing makes money every day.  What I like to see is that they provide the shareholders with as much information about their business as they can:  prospects, contracts, growth.   It seems to me that BBRW has done all this, their growth is promising, their debt is payable, everything has been posted and linked in different threads on here.   If you‚Äôre looking for a quick pumpNdump this is more of a buy and hold in 2020.   This industry doesn‚Äôt seem to have suffered much with the pandemic.

&gt; They are one of the older/more mature technologies, but they have a total platform including EV fleet vehicles to launch drones from and software. Their Horsefly drone has been in testing with USPS and their vehicles are in competition for the next gen USPS vehicles.

&gt; Logistically, the total integrated mobile launch platform makes more sense to me than the more static location models some are working with. Matternet is also going that route and partnered with Mercedes Benz. It's too bad they're a private company.

They've been in development since at least 2016 and are based around quadrocopters.  Their delivery system is a little more versatile since it's a basket that holds the package and not a uniform plastic box like the other main players right now.

It's interesting to hear that they're looking like a strong contender for USPS right now since the last info I heard was that their vehicle partner had dropped out.",2020-04-28

The way the law is written, stimulus checks are actually just advanced payments of a new ""recovery rebate"" tax credit for the 2020 tax year.‚Äù

And 

‚ÄúThe amount of your stimulus check is based on your filing status, your adjusted gross income (AGI), and the number of children you have who qualify for the child tax credit (they must be 16 years old or younger). If you filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return, the IRS will get this information from one of those returns (whichever one you filed most recently). However, you could have a change in circumstances this year that shrinks the recovery rebate credit allowed for 2020. This could mean that the stimulus check you receive this year is larger than the authorized tax credit on your 2020 return.‚Äù

Now are trying to build hype so they can get out.   Fact of the matter is  this company's sales dropped from 2018-2019 and I bet they are even worse now.  They have a 4-1 debt to assets.  And they ""claim"" to have a bunch of future sales which means fuck all. 

Also the craft beer movement is getting over saturated so sales will fall.  And when a brewer goes out of business they sell their old equipment that's worth a lot of $$ so they miss customers that way. 

If people thought this would be a huge company an investor  would have paid for their debt in equity in the company.
