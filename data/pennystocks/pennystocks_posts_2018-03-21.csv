0,ATE question,8617vo,Anderjesse,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8617vo/ate_question/,17,31,"Morning ladies and gents. Quick question. If I understand correctly Antibe Therapeutics just successfully passed stage 2b of testing. Now, my question is do they not have to still pass through stages three and four before their ATB-346 could possibly be accessible to costumers OTC in stores? I read also that phase 4 takes a minimum of two years of testing. So realistically we can expect to not see any major profits for another 2-3 years?",2018-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8617vo/ate_question/

2,OTC Pump &amp; Dump Promotions Never Came Back?,85z61t,No_Travel_Blog_Here,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85z61t/otc_pump_dump_promotions_never_came_back/,6,6,"I'm watching a lot of training videos - some of which are from around 2011 - 2013. 

It seems during this time there were a lot of really great OTC pump-and-dump promotions that traders could make really great returns on methodically, by simply signing up for lots of scammy penny stock newsletters (like one I keep hearing about - Awesome Penny Stocks) and paying attention to which ones actually successfully pump. 

Then the videos around 2014/2015 seem to say that the whole OTC pump-and-dump tactic stopped working - the whole thing dried up. 

For people that have been trading for awhile - can you explain what happened?

And - do you anticipate this having a rebound or do you think it's still dead now?",2018-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85z61t/otc_pump_dump_promotions_never_came_back/
3,BTL.VN Long Strategy (Target 50% Upside),85ycvv,nicky009p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85ycvv/btlvn_long_strategy_target_50_upside/,2,2,"BTLVN is a block chain technology company trading on the Toronto venture exchange. They are building enterprise block chain software with many commercial applications but currently there is great promise for use in the energy sector with a partnership to be announced shortly. The company has been trading down lately due to weakness in bitcoin pricing even though it is not directly related to crypto mining .

technical perspective: stock is currently at support levels and Iâ€™m expecting partnership announcements in Q2-3 to cause a rebound with a short-term target price of $8.53/share a 50% upside where the next resistance is at.",2018-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85ycvv/btlvn_long_strategy_target_50_upside/
4,Answering all questions for beginner trader about penny stocks (with Video),85y73j,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85y73j/answering_all_questions_for_beginner_trader_about/,27,3,"Hi, pennystocks subreddit members,

I thought to revive the old project I started some time ago. If you are following me from the beginning (when I used to have my old youtube account) you should know that I really like to use Google data to find information on searched keywords, keyword terms and associated volume. 

As well I like to use Google search trends which can very precisely forecast the mania and bubbles while Google aggregates the mass hysteria that is being typed into Google search box, like in example ""bitcoin"" or ""marijuana stocks"" etc..

So just to make this description shorter, I will tell the whole idea behind this video series: I used Google keyword data to find penny stock related search terms. Downloaded all data which I will base my future content with. 

This information is real questions and terms people type when searching for the content related to penny stock trading.

Initially it came to market (2015) around $1-2 with a peak at around $3. It then fluctuated (2016-2017) around a few cents and nothing came of it. Recently its gone from $0.09 in January to now, where its at ~$1.12. I slept on it and suffered, then bought in at $0.63. Hesitant to put in more and hope for the best or take the risk and pour more into it. Would like to hear everyone's opinion.
