Selling non producing properties and equipment as well as raising money to fund the 24-7 shift. Currently running 8-10 hours. They have all equipment necessary to run 24 hours a day and from what I gather just need the funds to pay the man hours. They seem confident their Santa elena mine will pay out well under this 24 hour shift. They are currently working deals with other companies to let them mine mexus' other 2 properties while Mexus collects royalties. This should have them collecting money off all 3 properties instead of just the 8-10 hour shift from the Santa Elena mine. Looks like this could be a good play. I am worried about the financials though, they look pretty bad. If they pull off all they say they are doing I think this could be well timed for a turn around. I dont really play with penny stocks and small caps though. Usually value investing large caps. What size is your position?",2020-02-23
