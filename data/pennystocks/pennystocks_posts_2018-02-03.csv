1,BLPG (interesting exposure to the marijuana industry),7ux4hz,seebz69,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ux4hz/blpg_interesting_exposure_to_the_marijuana/,17,2,Very interesting stock. The marijuana industry is strangled by scrutiny and regulations by federal pressure towards banking/taxes. Blue Line Protection Group has secured safe and compliant transportation for the entire industry and is expected to grow revenues of over 700% in 2018 alone. I personally think this is a great opportunity to get in on the already hot ‘pot stocks’ and provides a unique exposure. Its experiencing alot of resistance around .045-.06. Im expecting .2 by mid summer. Thoughts?,2018-02-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ux4hz/blpg_interesting_exposure_to_the_marijuana/

Been lurking here for a while. I went in on this on a tip from a friend after he showed it to me and some research. They just put out in my opinion an awesome quarterly and was wondering if anyone else has this on their radar?

7,Hemp,7uxddu,seebz69,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7uxddu/hemp/,11,10,"The last stock that i would strongly suggest buying is Hemp inc. They have no revenues or numbers on the books?!?! Well, For about 4 years hemp inc has been growing and cultivating hemp and kenaf in North Carolina (along with cultivation facilities accross multiple states).. 18million pounds to be exact. They are finally ready to start selling this newly high in demand product! They can sell the kenaf for about 2-4$ a pound. Expect hemp inc to start getting some attention come Q2 2018. The industrial hemp revolution has only just begun as all these regulations begin easing off and the public begins to see the environmental benefits of this movement. Thanks for listening! My 3 stocks for 2018... (BLPG/HEMP/MGXMF)",2018-02-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7uxddu/hemp/
