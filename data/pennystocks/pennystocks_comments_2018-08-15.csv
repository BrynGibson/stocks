This was a bonus and not intended to pay for my time, which was billed separate. This was intended to give me an equity interest in the company and to reward me for my work. So, not shitty at all.

What does have me concerned, though, is that no one will deal with this. It doesn't help that the volume is super low. It's been listed for over a year now, and the price hit triple from what it originally listed at, but it is currently about double, so I technically have double the equity.

But I can't effectively sell my shares because the market volume is no where near the amount of shares I have. I was planning on selling a fraction, and even that fraction was more than the past 30-day volume.

So, I presently have theoretical value. If things heat up and the company uplists, it would be a completely different story.",2018-08-15

Otherwise, apart from brokers, you can always try to find like-minded individuals in rooms like these so as to conduct a private transaction.

David Choe (born April 21, 1976) is an American street artist. His figure paintings, which explore themes of desire, degradation, and exaltation, are characterized by a raw, frenetic tone that he has termed ""dirty style."" In the graffiti world, he is identified with the bucktoothed whale he has been spray-painting on the streets since he was in his teens. David also hosted DVDASA, a lifestyle, relationship and entertainment podcast with co-host Asa Akira. He also became widely recognized for his watercolor works which exhibited in his solo show at the Museo Universario del Chopo, Mexico City in 2013.

Does it have a ""legend"" attached (on the back of it perhaps) that describes restrictions on the resale of your stock, perhaps? If it does have that legend, any sale would need to be conducted in accordance with those restrictions to be lawful. There might be restrictions on when you can make the sale (lock up period) and/or the type of investor you can sell it to.

If you end up selling the stock privately in certificate form, you'll need an attorney to draw up a purchase and sale agreement or similar to effect the transfer of ownership.

Good luck!",2018-08-15

Manipulative pre-arranged trading between straw buyer accounts at prearranged and ever-increasing prices is often the prelude to a pump and dump scheme. 

Basically the golden rule is only trade stock when you want to trade it.

 Never allow someone else to direct  the trading of an asset you own,  unless you have a written agreement on how to do it, like an investment management agreement, which is not the case here.",2018-08-15
