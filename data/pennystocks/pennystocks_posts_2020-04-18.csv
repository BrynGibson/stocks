How much do you typically invest into a specific penny stock range at a time? I noticed I tried to sell a penny stock with at around $5000, but got stuck buying at the limit when volume wasn't that high. It kept working with partial transactions in a course of about 1-2 hours. Is this typical? I know every company is and should be looked at within a case by case basis, but do people have a typical range on how much they put into stocks within the range of :

0-$0.30:

$0.30-$1:

$1-$4.95:

Most of the penny stocks were related to biopharm (SONN, I sold $10k usd less than one hour before news by the way) and even random ones like TLBT and AKRX prior to the rs and surge respectively.

During this week, the market was going crazy with the ups and downs. My play to play off pumpers in CNK and PLAY got hit hard, and my high risk reits (NRZ, MFA) seemed to swing off the volatility off the Dow, SPY, and even the nasdaq.

But I noticed a lot of my penny stocks, aside from the reits, weren't heavily impacted by the overall market. In fact, I've even seen some of the pump and dump stocks go UP with no news at all.

Question: My question is how much of an impact does the overall market have with pump and dump penny stocks?  Thank you in advance

DD in description,g3t9o2,TampaSunset,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g3t9o2/nat_is_going_to_the_moon_in_the_next_few_weeks_dd/,54,54,"I‚Äôm going to skip past explaining what an Oil Contango is. Also if you haven‚Äôt noticed, we‚Äôre in an oil crash on top of all this covid-19 volatility. 

Regardless, OPEC and Russia are claiming they have come to a deal to cut production, it‚Äôs not true. The saudi‚Äôs can still maintain profit while prices are near $20 a barrel. Low prices is bad for the U.S. oil game. Russia and Saudi Arabia are in a good position financially when U.S. oil is not doing well. 

Anyways this is where this play comes in.

$NAT is an oil shipping tanker company. They store oil on large ships and charge lots of money to store oil. They are currently charging 5x what they used to 6 months ago due to the over supply of oil and demand for storage for said oil. 

Their CFO recently bought 60,000 shares for $4.725 on 3/30

[source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/nordic-american-tankers-ltd-nyse-175556983.html)

Another interesting thing to note is their [dividend history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nat/dividend-history)

See the steep rise in 2014? That was last time barrel prices were dropping like they are now. 

**Low oil prices = good for oil storage tankers**

When they increase their dividends ‚Äî expect for institutional investors to hop in to secure nice dividends on a cheap stock. That‚Äôs going to be a huge jump in volume and it will send the price sky rocketing. Meanwhile, you‚Äôve been holding the whole timeüòâ

This is going to moon, hop in Monday. 

As of now, it‚Äôs trading for $4.06 I expect a movement to at least $6 maybe even $8 a share. 

Also, $STNG is another lucrative play but it‚Äôs not a penny stock...

Without going into too much detail, I am a long term terminal cancer patient with no family. Hence, I am not remotely worried about retirement or extremely long term investing. I am also not the type of person to buy and sell like mad on a daily basis. I don't have the energy, time, or smarts to do so. I am also on disability and don't have large sums of money.

However, I do have a few thousand to play with (separate from my savings) and with the market the way it is I have been dabbling a little in stocks I think are well below their value both to educate myself and because why not?  

However, my question is more specific to sub-penny stocks (there doesn't appear to be a separate subreddit for them?). A friend was talking about tucking some money away in super cheap stocks just on the offchance one of them gets bought or has a breakthrough or a really good earnings report or something, carrying them up a chunk and giving a nice return on the relatively cheap investment.

I guess I wanted some feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of stocks with 2-3 zeros after the decimal point. Maybe some suggestions on ones to look at. Or just general advice about them. Doing a search on here brings up precious few results (only recent one I noticed was repeated mentions of EWLL).

If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.
