Also, I'm on my phone so I'll keep this short.


&gt; This sounds true but do you believe a company can essentially reinvent itself by taking advantage of an opportunity? 

Uh, yep. 


Not all opportunities are equal, though, so it depends on the opportunity.

Looking at your example of DECN, their market was diabetes, and they do fine within their market. This opportunity comes in the form of a massive new market for them to break into using their existing technology. So far they haven't done anything wrong with this opportunity.

Will DECN pull it off? Time will tell. I'm playing it by ear.

&gt; Or do you think no matter what a company that has never been worth shit will find a way to fuck it up and be worthless again based off it's history of never being worth shit

Like I said. It's a company that does fine within it's market. Do I think no matter what a company will screw up an expansion based on their historical valuation alone? No, of course not. That's ridiculous. There's too many factors being ignored, mixed with romantic notions that talent always equals success. 

It's the business world, and their product is one that can't be advanced much at all within that market. In business, relationships are formed, and sometimes they last. It's unrealistic to expect their CEO to expand into a market where there's just not much room to expand.

This isn't a Disney movie. Sometimes talented people lose, sometimes talentless people win. Sometimes there's just nowhere to go/expand into.

But now there is, so we'll see what happens.",2020-04-07

To answer your first question, of course a company can reinvent itself. It happens all the time. Apple started out making niche computers that had a small slice of the market compared to PCs, then they fell apart, came back with a better product, then added personal electronics like the iPod and IPhone, started distributed media through ITunes and now Apple TV. 

Which leads to your point about DECNs CEO and CEOs in general. Go back to Apple, what was the difference there? Steve Jobs. CEOs have a huge impact on a companies success and value. Look at the ride Travis Kalanick took Uber on before they even went public. He had to leave the company he founded just on the notion his presence there was too toxic to have their IPO while he was there. 

DECN is so shitty it can’t even maintain minimum compliance to be on the NYSE or NASDAQ, which is why it’s a pink OTC. 

According to Wikipedia Pink OTCs are defined as “companies in the Pink market tier of the OTC categorization system do not meet the United States' listing requirements for trading on a stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Many of these issuers do not file periodic reports or make available audited financial statements, making it very difficult for investors to find reliable, unbiased information about those companies. For these reasons the SEC views many of the lower-tier companies traded on OTC Markets as ""among the most risky investments"" and advises potential investors to heavily research the companies in which they plan to invest.”

When you research their Chief exec, Keith Berman, this guy has an Undergrad in Business and an MBA, his Bloomberg bio has his industry as “Software” but he’s currently listed as the founder/president of two other bio companies and he’s been affiliated with DECN since 2013. 7 years and that company is shit. He has no medical background and based on his company’s performance he’s not a great businessman either. 

When it comes to DECN, they primarily make diabetes tests. They’re so passionate about it they spent years in court fighting Johnson and Johnson over a glucose test J&amp;J started selling, a lawsuit DECN ultimately lost in 2019. As far as I can tell the litigation goes back to at least 2013, with DECN winning a few rounds until they finally lost. Having to waste capital fighting a monster sized company like J&amp;J I’m sure had an impact on their ability to run a successful company. 

But even then, you have to ask, why does a company that’s been around for 18 years only make one product?

Or to reframe the question,
Why does a company who’s one product hasn’t brought them enough success to maintain NASDAQ/NYSE compliance tried something different in 18 years? 

I gotta guess it’s either lack of leadership, lack of talent, or lack of resources. Or perhaps a mixture of all three. 

But, there’s always a chance they strike gold with the rona. 

But not off the test they’re waiting for approval on now. That’s a short term win that we can all make a lot of money off of. 

The long term potential comes from the next one. 

The one they’re waiting for now is what they call the “pro” version of what they call their “swift kit” It’s a test for doctors and healthcare professionals to administer to patients. 

The next one is the home version. That’s the version they can sell in CVS/Walgreens etc. and grandma can go buy one if she gets a fever. 

This can possibly be a long term money maker for them. If COVID-19 turns out to be a seasonal thing, like Dr. Fauci, the CDC and so many others have predicted, in years to come, DECN cornering the market in at home testing can be huge. Every year the rona comes back, and folks will run to their local drugstore to grab a test and then make a decision on seeing their doc or not. 

But...18 years is a long time to suck. Having the right leadership to bring the right product to market at the right time is hard. This is not a company that’s proven an ability to do that. If it had, it would have stopped being a penny stock long ago. 

I hope this helps. Doing as much research as you’re comfortable doing before throwing your money on a position is always the way to go.

Now I am only down about $250 and I expect to see profit sometime this week but the fact I got into this company when its stock was at its peak recently at $0.149 shows I did not do my DD cause if I did I might've backed off for a week or so and watched it play out due to who the CEO is and taking other things into consideration like it being an 18 year old company but still an OTC stock which in return would of atleast allowed me to have bought the stock for $0.069 last week which would of been about double the amount of shares for the same price.

Like go more Alamo Drafthouse style with smaller showings, more individualized experiences. Less people in one area, especially with coming out of this virus situation will attract more interest I initially. 

That being said, the Wonder Woman 1984 release is what to watch for as that is one of the first ""blockbuster"" scale movies to go straight to streaming that would have rocked the box office normally. If it explodes and shows how strong the stream release can be, I expect another dip in the value of theatres which may indicate a culture shift. If it bombs then theatres still will have a very strong revival if we can get back to normality.

These type of ETFs are designed to return 3X the % change of the index they track on any given day - they will not necessarily move parallel to the index. 

If the underlying index goes up 1% on a given day, the ETF will go up 3%.  If the index goes down 1%, the ETF will go down 3%. It’s not always exact because the fund achieves this through advanced financial instruments and lots of leverage (debt) which are tricky to perfect. 

I’ve been following BRZU for a while but you can’t use it’s past history as an indicator for future growth.  These ETFs have a tendency to trend downward because of the nature of their movements.  Say the price is $1 and it drops 10% to $0.90, it would need to increase 11.1% from that price to get back up to break even at $1. They’re best used for short term trades when you feel you’ve identified a specific trend (upward/downward) in the underlying index they track.",2020-04-07

Third aspect I have had a coronavirus nasal swabs test and it is not a comfortable one ,hence fingerstick tests are important.  Now I dont k ow which companies will end up perfecting and hence my investment in different companies at the same time. 
Given the history of decn fingerstick testing history and them working  with the koreans who are destroying the shit out of covid 19, this company is one of the possible ones to succeed . But as I said above whenever you are investing in a penny stock you should invest what you are comfortable with that means not your rent/food/car/ children money.

I bought this stock almost a year ago when it was at 2 cents. Well before there was a virus and obviously well before they were announcing a testing kit for it. That was a complete surprise to me.  I bought it for different reasons and to keep for years but now this is a whole new ball game.  I do not believe this is a pump and dump anymore. If you're willing to hold on long term (months or years) there is no reason not to believe this stock will hit a dollar and potentially  a lot more.  That's my plan. I have 110,000K shares .

The machine would grind old tires and the patent, the machine was able to separate the steel belts from the rubber, quickly and efficiently, and they had several contracts lined up to sell the recyclable rubber which was going to be used in blacktop pavement. If you ever been to Arizona, much of there rubber went into the hwy 101. It was huge for AZ because driving on that highway was quiet. They laid the rubberized blacktop on top of the concrete.Since I'm in manufacturing it was easy to talk with the owner. I'm not saying Tyrex rubber went into the hwy, what I am saying they used this tech of old ground up tires to pave that hwy.",2020-04-07

&amp;#x200B;

Lafayette-based Viemed Healthcare is sending equipment and respiratory therapists to hospitals in Louisiana and across the country to assist with coronavirus patients.

&amp;#x200B;

The company, which specializes in at-home respiratory care, is working with several states to supply ventilaytors, oxygen concentrators, masks and BPap ventilators over the last four weeks as the COVID-19 cases have surged in Louisiana and across the country, company co-founder and CEO Casey Hoyt said.

&amp;#x200B;

The company is also hiring respiratory therapists – “as many as we can get our hands on right now,” Hoyt said – to help.

2020-04-13 05:22 PT - News Release

Mr. Casey Hoyt reports

VIEMED HEALTHCARE COMMENTS ON COMPETITIVE BIDDING

Viemed Healthcare Inc. is supporting the recent decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), due to the novel COVID-19 pandemic, to remove non-invasive ventilators (NIV) from the next round of the competitive bidding program (CBP) that was expected to begin in 2021, as the company believes that the inclusion of this life-saving device in the program could have had a negative outcome on patient care that is predicated on frequent and substantial service.

The company had prepared for the CBP over the last year, and had submitted bids in a majority of the areas around the country. The company will continue its existing expansion plan to provide this critical therapy to as many patients as possible around the country.

""We are excited to see CMS make many changes during the recent pandemic that we believe will have a positive impact on patient care,"" said Casey Hoyt, Viemed chief executive officer. ""We are extremely pleased with the recent announcement from CMS to remove NIV from the competitive bidding program which preserves the reimbursement needed for our company to continue investing in patient care. We believe this clearly signals the need to properly reimburse for clinicians to provide frequent and substantial service in the home for respiratory patients in order to prevent another hospital surge. This is a major win for Viemed's patients as we will have the resources to continue developing more critical care solutions aimed at improving patient quality of life.""
