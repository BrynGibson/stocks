The fed reserve basically prints money (some people might argue this point). With a blockchain backed currency, creating new money is not only likely to be more difficult but people will be able to get a good idea for where that money is going. I’m willing to bet the government would not be in favor of this.",2018-01-20
10,Talonx4,dsz2wg6,/r/pennystocks/comments/7rq2wk/why_doesnt_the_us_government_apply_blockchain_to/dsz2wg6/,1,"I agree with this.  Governments do not want every dime tracked.  Imagine if we could see every dime the government spends.  I am sure they wouldn't want to have lots of things found out.   

Hell, we can't even audit the federal reserve right now.  As of now, we have no idea where USA money goes.  Even our congressmen have no idea.  The federal reserve not only doesn't release this information, but they don't even track it.  There's a reason for that.  

I agree it's bad in the long run, but it has allowed America to look to look rich beyond belief.  Two cars and a home for every American.  If all that money was tracked, we would find that it doesn't exist.  Banks basically loan out more than they have and if people saw that there was literally no cash and that their investments and savings accounts are basically IOUs it would cause a panic.
