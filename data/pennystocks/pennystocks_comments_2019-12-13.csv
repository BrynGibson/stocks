29,DecadentHam,faormeh,/r/pennystocks/comments/ea1ssq/check_out_amtx_for_2_day_trading/faormeh/,1,"There are a few factors here. The price of the stock, the float, number of trades, volume history etc.

Looking at AMTX it's trading roughly 20,000 shares a day. That's roughly $20,000 at $1 a share per day. If you were to trade $1,000 you are 5% of the volume for the day. You're buying/selling will impact the stock price and there's no way to get out easily. You'll have to keep matching the bid/ask price.  

But there's that trade variable. How many people are buying and selling? Is that volume from many trades or a few? If it's only from a few traders, who will buy/sell your stocks? There are so few trades happening with AMTX that even a small buy/sell moves the price up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

There's no set amount of volume to be trading. There's too many variables. Practice and study, you'll understand it in no time. Look into $ volume and match up the charts. A $20 stock with 10,000,000 volume will behave differently than a 0.01 stock with the same amount of volume.

I like liquidity, if volume dries up I get out.
