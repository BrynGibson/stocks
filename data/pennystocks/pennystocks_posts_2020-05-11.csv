There a few bullish moving average signals. The 8 day SMA (green line) has just crossed the 200SMA (blue line). The 20 day EMA (pink line) has crossed the 50 day SMA (yellow) and looks on course to cross the 200SMA as long as we say movements to the upside running up the merger.

Technical Analysis

Green line indicating a positive trend, red negative and white the strength of the trend.  Bare in mind that when the white line is over the range 20-25 this indicates a strong trend so there are signs of a strong positive trend here. Will be monitoring the ADX in case of the line creeping into the higher regions.

OBV is showing that more people than ever are accumulating the stock in the last week than at any other point - 448.25m

&amp;#x200B;

Stochastics are in the 40-50 region with a downward bias and RSI flirting around 50-60 region. As long as RSI maintains this region and doesn't push into the overbought area I will expect to see some more bullish sentiment.

21,What does this stock trading message actually mean?,ghzltm,songtailor,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghzltm/what_does_this_stock_trading_message_actually_mean/,3,13,"Question: I already have like 6,200 shares in the stock DECN through Fidelity. I bought those like a month ago before the stock was suspended. It seems like all other companies BUT Fidelity are trading it now. I get the message: ""(TC9050) Opening transactions for Caveat Emptor are not permitted because of the risks associated with these securities and all Microcap securities.""

There is no ask or bid price listed on Fidelity. Both are 0. I called and spoke to a Fidelity trading rep and I asked what that message means. She said, ""I don't know.""  She basically said to keep checking it every day until it is trading. Doesn't make any sense. 

Can anyone explain what this is and why they won't let me buy it? DTTC reinstated the stock last week, obviously. The price is visible bouncing up and down on Fidelity's website all throughout the day, which is ignorant because they won't let me buy it. Every time I call, they keep asking, ""Are you trying to sell?""  It was like talking to a wall with two different people. I said, ""No, I'm trying to BUY MORE"" and they were clueless.

I'm reading that other people on Schwab, Vanguard, etc., are trading this stock. Why would Fidelity block it? I'm puzzled by the part of their message that particularly says, ""...because of the risks associated with these securities and all Microcap securities.""

What the heck? ALL stocks and securities have risks associated with them. You could lose money at any time.",2020-05-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghzltm/what_does_this_stock_trading_message_actually_mean/

The machine sells for $31,000, but the real money-maker is the $900 filters that get changed regularly and between patients.

Why is this a COVID play? Because COVID causes fluid imbalances in your body that are difficult to manage. With Aquadex, your doctor hooks you up to the filter and it manages the water content of your bloodstream automatically. [The WHO designated fluid management as a key problem in effective COVID treatment.](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/330893)

Before COVID, CHF struggled to get these things into hospitals. But now, Aquadex units are selling like hotcakes. CHF has had to [rapidly scale up their production](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-doubles-production-staff-aquadex-smartflowtm) to keep up with demand. In NYC alone, they have [increased the number of units by 300%.](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-announces-300-increase-utilization-aquadex-therapy) Doctors love these things because the automated fluid management frees up MD/nurse staff/dialysis so they can treat the trillion other patients flooding their ER. It also more controlled than diuretic medications and avoids side effects. Once the units are in hospitals, they will get used and those $900 filters keep getting rolled out the door.

This company has a dogged history. It struggled to get on its feet early on, flip-flopping between products and reverse splitting its stock to hell to stay compliant. Further, they really failed in marketing a great product. If you look at their balance sheet for last year, they burn tons of cash on admin and marketing without much to show for it. I think, for those reasons, a lot of investors – myself included – were or are not bullish on management long-term. However, COVID is turning out to be the exposure they needed to push product and for once they are actually rising to the opportunity and pushing.

The play is to pick up shares (if you pick up tomorrow at pre-market opening, you'll be in before earnings are released) now. You can dump after earnings, or hold for the duration of COVID – their next quarter will be probably also be stellar.

My position: $CHFS x 2000 long, (although I might pick up a couple thousand more pre-market tomorrow).",2020-05-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghzj2u/chfs_sleeper_covid_play_earnings_tomorrow/

For noobs, by a noob.",ghynm0,FatalComplex111,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghynm0/really_long_poorly_formatted_guide_on_how_to_stay/,18,88,"[Edit: someone please redo this and reformat it]


Much like myself,  I'm sure people that are starting out are lost when it comes to getting into a stock early, instead of hopping in after, or during the tail end of a pump hoping you can still ride the wave - after good news, ( or bad news) drops. You might also wish you knew when events were taking place in advance. 

So heres what I've figured works pretty well for me so far. 

- My first resource is here. Basically just to see what stocks seem to be popular, and get a few to add to my watchlist. Also some of you post some really fire DD, which is always appreciated. 

- Second, I'll go on stocktwits and add those few to my watchlist on there. That app is pretty amazing. It shows news, analyst ratings, and a chat type thing where I've been getting a general sentiment. Some people may have been holding a stock for a while and suggest it's a dumpster fire, a load of ass, a diarrhea dump. I've also seen POS (piece of shit). It could also be the opposite. Theres also much more, all for free. (I think)

- Something else in my bag of tricks, I downloaded an app. Its a scanner. For penny stocks. Its called **Penny stocks: OTC &amp; penny stock screener &amp; tracker** 
There is a preset filter for our type, penny stocks under $1, I go there and filter by volume. That way I can see what's about to pop off. I believe volume increases, and price follows. Correct me if I'm wrong but its pretty reliable. I add things with multiple times their avg. volume to my watchlist, then do my research via previous resource.(stocktwits)
***MAJOR KEY ALERT.  BE WARY OF RANDOM PUMP AND DUMPS ON THAT APP. THERES LIKE 1 OR 2, AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY SUPER OBVIOUS, USUALLY WITH STUPID NAMES, AND MOST LIKELY WILL BE CALLED OUT IN THE BUILT IN CHAT BUT JUST BE CAREFUL.***

- And for the coop de grassy. I will visit all the companys' websites that are on my watchlist. Did you know that your favorite stocks website has an ""Investor Relations"" section? I didnt until recently. It works, and will have all types of information. I just click the upcoming events &amp; announcements part. The best part: you can sign up with your email to recieve alerts for info/news/announcements/upcoming events. That way you will be one of the first to know, instead of having to wait to see stuff by chance on reddit, or your news feed. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Boom. Sorry idk how to format and do underlines and bold and stuff. Maybe someone can redo it and make it easier to read. Then maybe it can be stickied so people that are newer can have somewhat of a guide on doing DD, and just having information resources at their disposal. 

I hope this helps at least 1 person. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

There was significantly lower volume today which is likely because everyone is holding their cash for a dip. SPOILER... no dip is coming. Everybody knows that TTNP will knock its EPS out of the park because the pharmaceutical industry is hotter than your mom right now.

The company is rated BUY by MotleyFool, CNNMoney, MarketBeat, WSJ, Yahoo Finance.... and practically every market watching website, newsource, or blogger out there.

Before the virus hit, TTNP had a strong bull movement upwards past $0.40 and then was pushed down due to macro market movements. Nothing has changed for the company and they've been building momentum as the US markets recover. Well, its looking like its finally time and once they post their  earnings, theres no coming back down.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to see TTNP at $.65 in a week and longterm even $.79. 
I don't see it over $1 yet, but depending on how the next 2 weeks are, its not out of the picture by the end of the year.
I myself picked up 50,000 shares at $.29 

If you put enough in, this could be the one you retire on.

They saw 9% growth from previous quarter, 8% growth YOY, and they were able to take advantage of the COVID19 business loan to offset employment costs. They’re divesting some smaller, less profitable brands which should be in the numbers by earnings Q3, and they’ve made some pretty quick changes to increase direct-to-home sales. 

This is not a pump and dump, it’s a long hold, but they just had a dip after the report was released, and with a lower price target of 2.50, I could see this stock doing very well in the next 60-90 days.

Its channel is supposed to launch in mid June. Lots of good stuff coming for them in the next few months. Consensus is a modest target price of around $1-$1.5 by June. Buy now if you want guaranteed 50%-100% gains in about 30 days. (I know a lot of this sub wants to double their money in a day)

Also, tomorrow is when their offering closes so the stock price should spike by at least 10%. If you want to make a quick buck on GNUS buy today and sell tomorrow. If not, just set and forget for 1-2 months and you'll see some good gains.",2020-05-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ght6yt/gnus_starting_to_fly/

**As of 5/11/20 20, it is trading at around .27 a share.**


“Titan intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including: resuming the development of its single-port robotic surgical system, instruments and accessories; funding working capital (including the reduction of outstanding payables); and capital expenditures.”


Titan Medical is working on something for the future here. I believe in it because I think there will be a continued growing barrier between patients and doctors because of the pandemic. Robots able to routinely perform surgeries will also be extremely cost effective and safer than a human surgeon. They are much more precise and consistent.

239,Today and tomorrow will be a big shake down of shopping mall REITs. $SKT $SPG,ghqwbm,ndnrdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghqwbm/today_and_tomorrow_will_be_a_big_shake_down_of/,4,5,"Retail REITs are going to be hit HARD.  Simon (SPG) does earnings call tonight. Tanger (SKT) tomorrow.  Neither of these are technically penny stocks, but I expect Tanger to go there tomorrow (it's at about $6.50 at the moment).

I'm holding 100 SKT at $4.50.   Here's the DD on it....

The good:
Tanger is VERY conservative, and keeps a good balance sheet. They don't take huge risks, and typically have a bunch of cash reserves.  They are exclusively outlet malls.  Discount stores do better when times are bad. Them ladies need to shop, but they try and save money.  

Tanger prides itself on always paying a dividend. Come hell or high water, they'll pay.

Simon Properties are the big kid on the block. Tanger just nabbed the CEO of Simon to be their president/CEO.  That's like Shasta cola nabbing the CEO of Coke.

The bad:
It's retail. Nuff said.  Also, some major brands are going bankrupt, so they will lose tenants.  

The ugly:
They'll most likely announce record losses since they've been shut down.  Even if all the stores have paid rent sitting Covid-19 shutdown (probably haven't) they'll lose money.  Malls owners collect a base rent and then a percentage of sales.  They'll lose that percentage.

New CEO *could* be great news, or really bad. Depends on what he does.

My money is on Simon buying Tanger, but not in the near future, since they just bought someone else and are getting hammered with Covid.  

Whatever SPG announces will be a big tell as to what SKT will announce tomorrow.",2020-05-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghqwbm/today_and_tomorrow_will_be_a_big_shake_down_of/

247,$ZOM My thoughts,ghqm6x,rice4thewin,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ghqm6x/zom_my_thoughts/,9,14,"Personally I bought it on friday when everyone was selling it (still about the same price rn). Even with the news that $QRVO is partnering up with ZOM on friday it was going lower and lower, Im pretty sure this was because of people panic selling due to what happened with MVIS, yall didnt want the same thing to happen again. 

Now here's why i'm holding on to this:  
1. FDA approval is NOT needed. They are already about to be in production of their product Truforma since they didn't need an approval. So once it hits the market I think we only going up from here.  
2. I can see their product being used by a majority of vets around the world  
3. Why would a billion dollar company like QRVO partner with ZOM? They wouldn't do it unless they saw potential in their product  
4. If they did an actual PR and not a twitter post on this stuff I could see a spike  
5. Look at the chart for the past month, it's only been going up from here. I doubt its a pump and dump stock since partnering with QRVO is prob enough for a continuous uptrend throughout the year

Just my thoughts. Don't start shit talking to me cuz im new, I just started this stuff 2 months ago lmao. Any other input on this would be great tho.

[Looking at the chart we see that the price is trading at $0.454. It is seen that price has recently broken the resistance at $0.370 turning it into support. The new resistance is at $0.651. The upward rally started after the formation of morning star pattern which is bullish reversal pattern indicating upward movement. ](https://preview.redd.it/6pjs1hdzh1y41.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d86c34c5796b2de1d687f32711a29e4d8744a33)

**DOW THEORY**

[According to Dow Theory the Coin is currently seen in the accumulation phase it is a phase in which investors \\""in the know\\"" are actively buying stock against the general opinion of the market. During this phase, the stock price does not change much because these investors are in the minority demanding stock that the market at large is supplying. This phase is followed by the public participation phase in which public starts actively taking positions and upward rally is seen.](https://preview.redd.it/y19933vei1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df789dda1c4202b4586c8abd51424cc1e4f6de2a)

**Bollinger Bands** 

[The price was moving between the channels with the upper limit acting as resistance and the lower limit acting as support. It is seen that the channel is expanding and the price has broken the upper limit with positive momentum which indicates rapid increase in price, long position can be taken keeping the upper limit as stop loss.](https://preview.redd.it/spqgzevpi1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe0edf3d65d2f1872fc3b9b5408a6eb70f4e9bba)

**Moving Average** 

[Taking 9 period moving \(blue\) averages with 21 period moving averages \(red\). Bullish crossover is seen with price trading above the 9 period moving average so a long position can be taken as long as price trades above the moving average with 9 period moving average acting as a support.](https://preview.redd.it/9vohpsrxi1y41.png?width=1076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d04b14bcbb36bb1e8945a63cfec5524fd0aa4a0)

**Conclusion**

The price is trading at $0.454. The support is at $0.370 and the resistance is at $0.651. The price is expected to enter the public participation phase as indicated by the bollinger bands and the moving averages. Also the formation of the morning star pattern at support confirms the upward price movement. So long positions be taken Keeping stop loss around support. Using Fibonnaci and pivot point the price is expected to reach $0.834. It is suggested to be careful when the price reaches the resistance of $0.651 and look for false breakout.

This is the first time that I make a post here but first of all a big thank you to everyone that adds value to the PennyStocks with analysis, posts and comments. Thank You.

So, I am a little undecided in which stocks I should go for the coming weeks. 

I was thinking in those:

* AYTU
* PRTY
* AIM
* ONTX
* TTI

Can I have your opinion about them? Or do you recommend another ones?

- The company was rated an 88 which is amazing for a companies management 

- Their most recent EPS was met

- There has been a spike in the stocks volume which could lead to an increase in the price of the stock tomorrow 

- Analysts set a target price of $1 

- TTNPs earnings date is the 15th so there’s lots of time for the stock price to rise

New wave of players in this market, and a new wave of stupidity. With stupidity comes those who are without morals, and will trick you into believing nonsense. They will gladly take your money if you handed it to them. 

New promoters pop up all the time. Sometimes with fancy indicators. Sometimes with ""well constructed DD."" Sometimes they simply promote themselves as being fantastic traders. 

Some of us, who've been on this subreddit long enough, have seen these promoters come and go. Users like CaptainWeee, who was a glorified pump and dump artist, Tuffadams, etc. All scam artists. You'll even notice comments of sheep DEFENDING these charlatans. These commenters all no longer trade. If you defend these scam artists, you'll be on the wrong side of history.

The new nonsense is a no-name stocktwit user. We will call him scammer salm. Scammer salm fancies himself as a great trader. He frequently posts on alt accounts to push his own stock picks. This is known as astroturfing in the political realm. 

Where did he come from? Why are there redditors RAVING about his picks? Do his picks work? All these questions will be answered in the piece below.

**Where did he come from?**
-

Most promoters do the exact same things. They sell a service or promote a stock. They use alternate accounts to push their posts. They don't just ""spawn"" out of no where. They don't gain traction naturally. In fact, Scammy Salm is yet another pump and dump artist, using the same tricks that anyone could do. Buying upvotes, using alternative accounts, and giving a false perception of what's truly the case. Like the idea you can be profitable by following his callouts. Some promoters are more cleaver. Intentionally create controversy about their stock pick. That's smart, because it baits in more clicks and buyers. None of these traders who ""buy early on the pumps"" survive. Never.

**Why are there redditors RAVING about his picks?**
-

It's a trick. Some are genuinely invested in his picks. Sorry to say, these are the sheep that'll took the bait hook line and sinker. Most aren't raving. Most are actually him. His posts. His upvotes. His promotion.

Scammer salm creates a false perception by pushing his own material through manipulative means. This is what others on here have done. It's nothing new. In fact, you can find tons of evidence on older 2000s message boards. See the promoters job is to promote. They know they can make money by convincing as many people as possible. Before the contrarians fire back and say that's what I'm doing, I have no financial incentive. 

**Do his picks work?**
-

Study history. Not only have promoters, and the sheep following them, all failed off, but they've created the next wave. The next wave of people who're just as gullible. I can't comment on the longevity of following a promoters picks. Many people are fooled by survivorship bias. They're convinced that their 2 - 10 profitable trades will lead to longevity. It doesn't. It will fail given enough variables and time.

These stocktwit screenshots and other promotions aren't spawning randomly. I think many are beginning to question why the moderators approved of image posting. Couldn't they see it was bound to be subject to manipulation? Probably. Perhaps shorting these posters is a better and more reliable method of profiting then doing ""DD"" on a long.

If you follow someones stock picks once, and it works, great! The more you follow their picks, the lower your account value will fall. 

You can, however, profit by figuring out who the house is. 

That's your edge.

I've never touched, long or short, any of these promoters picks (including scammer salm).

Best of luck.

I made a post about this stock a week ago, and ended up buying in on a whim.  So far, it's paid off - though I'm still in, so who knows.  I wanna hold, but with so much profit why risk it?

So I have this watchlist widget on my phone, and LUV was on it. One day in late March/early April, I pulled out my phone and found that it had been unlocked, and some of that widget's settings had gotten messed up - LUV (Southwest Airlines) had been changed to LUVU Brands - a company known for Liberator sex pillows, as well as a health product manufacturing line which is now producing protective gear like masks and gloves.

It was .05 back then.  Over the next few weeks it would grow by 15-20% each day, before dipping back down.

So I bought in, 1000 shares at .15

Today it grew to .25, pretty decent profits.

So what do you guys think?  Ride it out until the May 15th sales discussion?  I don't really know how to do DD, but if anyone has insights on what to look at, I'd appreciate it.  Should I hold until the sale discussion, or take the money and run?
