I think before one asks “what are they missing” the question should be “why are they running” only then, once one is armed with his research [to the best of his ability], can he ask “OK, here’s the complete situation, what/why are they seeing different”. Or, like you said, maybe it’s all emotional and just the trends. 

Though that’s peripheral, I’m more curious how and what kind of algorithm can be developed for situations like these. It’s very risky to guess public corporate decisions based on patterns - each board member has a mind of their own, aside from the important factor of buyers’ interest which is not in their control. There’d have to be an enormous amount of determinants that said algorithm is analyzing; I imagine you’d agree forecasting stocks isn’t exactly like playing Russian roulette (hence your two hour research).  Now, needless to say, I don’t expect you to share the details of this algorithm on the internet but perhaps you can grace us with some general details or pointers why you think this way or that way (e.g. “I think they’re going to go for a buyout even if underpriced bec. I read that the big honcho on the board became a Buddhist munk and loathes money” or “I think they’re going to pass on the low-ball offer because they have massive debt which they intend to pay off from the sale’s proceeds”).

All in all, obviously it comes down to the individual’s educated decision/guess though kernels of tips/input from the sub’s members is useful (even though such information too must we weighed seriously to accept or reject).",2020-01-14

92,livestrong2209,fefcukd,/r/pennystocks/comments/eolz18/tuesday_morning_penny_stocks_1142020/fefcukd/,1,"Well some general things to look at are volatility if a stock has massive repetitive swings year after year and suffers a large single day loss and there is a pattern of it recovering or shaking off bad news then it's a buy. 

Alternatively if a stock has very consistent patterns you can buy that stock as well expecting to recover at least 5-10% that same week. The swing is likely an anomaly. 

I toss out companies that just burn cash and fall. That an obvious disqualifier. It's a requirement when look at penny stocks because most are trash. 

Insider buying is another major factor in what gets looked at. If an owner says a stock is worth $10 and it's trading for $1.50 and he then buys back on every dip there is a decent chance he believes it. He might even take the company private.

Every trade I make is meant to take advantage of some type of large negative swing that was likely over sold the day before. My YTD is 40.27% using the above method.",2020-01-14
