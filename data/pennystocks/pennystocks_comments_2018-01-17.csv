""The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2009 as Santa Pita Corp to operate an internet portal for dentists and patients to access dental information, as well as a teeth-whitening business.On July 30, 2012 the Company redirected its focus toward precious metal exploration and mining. Mineral exploration began with a mineral claim acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”), with GEXPLO, SRL (the “Vendor”) and the Company, whereby the Company agreed to acquire from the Vendor a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a claim (“the Claim”) located in the Dominican Republic. The owner of the Vendor, Alain French, became President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director on the acquisition closing date.On April 10, 2015 the Company entered into a plan of “Exchange Agreement”, whereby it acquired Cathay Cigars of Asia (“Cathay”) a Florida corporation. Upon the acquisition Alain French resigned all roles as Company officer and board director and issued back into treasury all preferred shares and common shares of the Company. In conjunction with the Exchange Agreement certain liabilities between Officers and mineral exploration partners of the Company, were settled in the form of notes having various terms. As per the Exchange Agreement, Franjosé Yglesias became President and Chief Executive Officer and Matthew Arnett became Chief Marketing Officer, each receiving 150,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company for their interest in Cathay.With the acquisition the Company changed its operations to a lifestyle brand, marketing high value luxury lifestyle products to the leisure and entertainment sector.On July 15, 2015 the Company re-domiciled to the State of Florida from the State of Nevada.On October 15, 2015 the Company filed a Form 15-12G to relieve itself temporarily of its filling obligations with the Securities Exchange Commission.""",2018-01-17

Problem with OTC, and even worse if an overseas company, is that there is very little oversight. You have to be double careful if a stock is not on the major exchanges. If it looks like a pump and dump, it probably is. 

Always with OTC I sell half if I double up so I am on a freeroll. Usually I just take 25% and never look back. I hate to see people ride a 10x+ pump and hold through thinking they found the Holy Grail. 10x IS the Holy Grail! Sell it, go buy some good scotch, and be a spectator while other people rationalize the stock price plummeting as they try to average down or to decide when they've had enough. Been there, never doing that again. If a stock looks like it is doing amazingly but company has no plans to seek listing on a major exchange, there is always the chance it is because they do not want to be scrutinized.",2018-01-17
