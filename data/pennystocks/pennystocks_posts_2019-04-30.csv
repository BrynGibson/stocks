Enter into Definitive Agreement for Reverse Acquisition of Imaging3, Inc. by Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc.",bj438m,lagefut,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bj438m/imaging3_inc_otcmktsigng_and_grapefruit_boulevard/,32,10,"Burbank, CA, April 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG), (‚ÄúIGNG‚Äù) or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a development stage company focused on the introduction of disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, is further updating its prior announcement regarding the execution of a non-binding letter of intent (‚ÄúLOI‚Äù) to be acquired in a reverse acquisition (the ‚ÄúAcquisition‚Äù) by Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc. (‚ÄòGBI‚Äù) a privately held Los Angeles based cannabis company and simultaneously vend its imaging business into a privately held corporation which will be partially owned by post - Acquisition IGNG .

On Sunday, April 28, Imaging3 and GBI executed a definitive Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù), at the closing of which GBI will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of IGNG and GBI‚Äôs shareholders and other persons will own approximately 81% of the post-Acquisition common shares of IGNG. The IGNG common shares representing the 81% IGNG stake will be restricted securities issued to the current GBI shareholders on a pro rata basis to their GBI ownership in exchange for their GBI shares which will thereafter be owned by IGNG. At the conclusion of the Acquisition the Company will have approximately 387,969,000 common shares issued and outstanding, subject to adjustment, of which GBI management will own approximately 230,223,000 shares or approximately 60% of the then outstanding common shares of the Company. In addition, at the closing, a newly formed corporation (‚ÄúNew I3‚Äù) will assume all of the current assets and most of the liabilities of IGNG. IGNG will thereafter own a yet-to-be determined percentage of the shares of New I3. Furthermore, closing of the Acquisition will be dependent upon IGNG reaching final terms with an Investor or Investors for an investment of $12,000,000.00 of debt and equity in IGNG.

The closing of the transaction will occur on or before the business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the acquisition which both IGNG and GBI management expect to be on or before May 20, 2019 (the ‚ÄúClosing‚Äù). Within 75 days of the Closing the Company shall file a Form 8-K with the SEC which will include, along with all other required disclosures, audited pro forma consolidated financial statements of IGNG and GBI from GBI‚Äôs inception through the period ended April 30, 2019. IGNG and GBI have met on multiple occasions with IGNG‚Äôs auditor to discuss and plan for the production of these audited pro forma financial statements.

From the filing of the initial IGNG/GBI press release March 18, 2019, GBI management has been proceeding with the GBI business and as previously announced the GBI extraction laboratory has, since the beginning of April, been in continuous operation producing high quality cannabis distillate for sale into the California market.

John Hollister, IGNG CEO stated, ‚Äúwith the advantageous settlement of the Alpha/Brio/IGNG dispute behind us, the Yourists and I have been able to concentrate on negotiating and agreeing upon the detailed terms of the Acquisition which is now done. Now, we will cooperatively proceed to finalize the terms of our financing, close the Acquisition, GBI management will proceed with executing GBI‚Äôs business plan and New I3 will proceed with financing and further developing the Dominion project‚Äù.

Bradley Yourist, GBI CEO added. ‚ÄúWe are gratified to have successfully met yet another challenge on our way to becoming the preeminent fully integrated cannabis product company in California and beyond. We will now focus our efforts to, as quickly as possible, finalize our financing terms and close the Acquisition‚Äù

Potential investors in IGNG‚Äôs common shares are cautioned that there can be no assurances that the reverse acquisition of IGNG by GBI will ever be closed and that even if it is, there can be no assurance that the Company will thereafter be able to obtain the financing necessary to achieve its articulated goals and further that even if such financing is obtained that it will be sufficient for the Company to achieve its ultimate goals or to even remain in business.

Usually stocks that i trade start out as $1 so since there are no commisions cant i keep the 1 share as an insurance that i wont get a PDT strike?

Summary: if i keep 1 share if a stock to prevent closing a position, cant i avoid ‚Äúdaytrading‚Äù since i never actually left the position completely?
