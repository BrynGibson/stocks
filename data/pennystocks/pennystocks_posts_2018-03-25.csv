0,The Nihilism has gone to far!,86xpvv,Delta_Pilot_69,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86xpvv/the_nihilism_has_gone_to_far/,0,48,"This rant was brought up because I posted a simple question thread hoping to  get some ideas and a general discussion going about  the state of the market. What j received instead was a dismissive statement and a fuck off attitude. I thought I would repost it as a new thread to see what this community thinks.



The point of this sub is to discuss ideas so we can get a better understanding of the market as a whole. You did not post a fair critique of this sub. When you state that no one knows anything you made a self defeating argument.

If no one knows anything, this entire community is pointless, by extention the whole act of talking to share ideas. The basic human condition is to communicate to spread ideas and solve problems

Furthermore your willingness to post and be in this community shows that there is something of value here. You could be snorting cocaine and slamming vodka right now.

Finally I think you discounted your own opinion way too quickly. Everyone has something to share and I don't appreciate when people discount that.",2018-03-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/86xpvv/the_nihilism_has_gone_to_far/
