FY17 Revenue of 425K (Very Weak Top Line)

FY17 Price to Sales of 131.74 (Overvalued)

FCF (TTM) of -6.893M (Negative Cash Flow)

I would be wary of this one for awhile.  There is very little catalysts for growth based on it's current fundamentals.  Even if it rallys from here, it has to change fundamentally to make lasting gains.",2018-07-22

They already have a lot of marijuana related aquisitions, including social media and crypto currency. Just reduced their offered shares by 200,000,000 and have big news coming next week, of a big aquisition. Should shoot up nicely",2018-07-22

But this is a legit company, with a decently strong base. When the PR drops, this one should go crazy as we've seen from previous charts. Right now, this is the lowest level it's been at in weeks. Have done my DD as most of the base has, hence I'm holding strongfor the long haul. Should be very promising once the ball gets rolling.",2018-07-22

unfortunately they are just traded over FINRA OTC. many dont have access to that over their broker. they plan on going public somewhere else?",2018-07-22
