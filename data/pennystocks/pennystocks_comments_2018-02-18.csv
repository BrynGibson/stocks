1,Luffykyle,dufcpgm,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ycg1z/akers_fda_approval/dufcpgm/,1,March 5th isnâ€™t necessarily the date that it gets approved but rather the date that the FDA is possibly going to announce the approval.  The thing is tho that AKER will most likely release a message sooner than the fda because the have to make it public soon after they find out their product has been approved so it depends on how soon Aker finds out before the 5th of March.  ,2018-02-18

It might be a good time to buy and swing as the momentum is growing for March 5th. I played this at the end of January into Feb. 5 and made an easy 1k just shorting the morning spikes. Could also get lucky and itâ€™s actually approved. I would watch the charts closely over the next week. ",2018-02-18

This is going to be controversial on this sub since almost everyone here thinks he's a scam. I started off watching his free YouTube videos. After watching these I could tell that he was real. Then I subscribed to his penny stocking silver service. You don't have to take my word for it but I would recommend watching his YouTube videos since they are free and have no risk tied to it since they are free.,2018-02-18

scam or not , we all have experience in the field and can at least tell when someone is bluffing , coming from forex I have seen many of them , but there is no harm watching , might end up beneficial , and u can always learn a thing or tow so I'll definitely check it

21,Talonx4,duh57wi,/r/pennystocks/comments/7yig2i/what_does_it_take_to_go_from_forex_to_pennystocks/duh57wi/,1,"Welcome to the ups and downs of penny stocks.  Atleast with forex, you are used to that part.  

First thing you should learn is what makes the market move.  Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to know the company, the products, debt to income ratios, ect...  Most veterans don't buy and sell based on this.  They buy and sell based on whats moving.  In one hour, out the next.  The most I hang on to a stock is about 3 days.  Kind of like forex, you can find patterns in penny stocks.  Ride the patterns.  There are a lot of resources to help you out.  The discord for this sub isn't bad, and this sub is full of information.  

Pick the right broker for you.  Robinhood is free, but limited to PDT rule 3 trades every 5 days, and no OTC stokcs.  Ustocktrade is $1 a trade, but unlimited day trades, and no OTC stocks.  Easy to whip money around quick though with no wait times.  Then your major brokers are all similar.  $5 a trade, with OTC stocks.  And can short sell.  Personally I like Interactive Brokers, but Charles Schwab also isn't bad.  All four of those have workable apps.  

You can checkout the penny stock training subreddit that u/iwasthechosenone and I have setup.  We don't push stocks and its completely free.  We don't have books or any paid content.  Simply tips and advice we use in every day trading.  https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyStockTraining/

Find your trading style and what works for you and stick to it.  Not every trading style is right for every person.  You have to find what works for you.  ",2018-02-18

So basically its like forex but faster with small wins per share of stock ( just like scalping ) 
And technical analysis does actually work in this case ( support resistance... )
