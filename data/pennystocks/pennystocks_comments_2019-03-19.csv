Assuming you‚Äôre under the PDT rule you can only make 3 day trades in a 5 day period so choose quality stocks.  

Instead of going for home runs go for singles. 1-2  percent with 3 trades equals about 6 percent a week. Now compound interest should almost triple your money in a year. Make sure to have a stop loss and just eat it early  50 dollars is a lot easier to recover over 500 dollars.

DKN-01 is in clinical trials in patients with esophagogastric, hepatobiliary, gynecologic, and prostate cancers. Leap's second clinical candidate, TRX518, is a humanized GITR agonist monoclonal antibody designed to enhance the immune system's anti-tumor response that is in advanced solid tumor studies.‚Äù

They aren‚Äôt even halfway through their study with DKN-01, and they‚Äôve seen patients with positive outcomes. They have another half of their patients that are going to go through imaging. They also plan to increase the dose at the next step to see if more people will respond effectively.  So far, no toxicity  has been observed with the drug.

They presented at a GYN conference, but if this drug can effectively treat the esophagogastric, hepatibiliary, and prostate cancers as well...then this stock is super bullish. Esophagogastric means esophageal and stomach cancers can be treated. Hepatobiliary means liver, biliary, and gall bladder related cancers can be treated. Prostate cancer is the top leading cancer for men. 

And then they have trx518 testing in the future as well. An agonist for monoclonal antibody. This basically stimulates your body to send more antibodies to the tumor cells by activating the same receptor your body would recognize with it‚Äôs own cells. But your body might not be able to hit all the receptors on it‚Äôs own, so this drug increases the amount of receptors activated.
