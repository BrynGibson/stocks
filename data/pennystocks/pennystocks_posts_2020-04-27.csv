Let me just lay out the facts so y'all can quit bsing and acting like DECN &amp; AYTU are even comparable. 

Many on here are previous AYTU bag holders that perhaps sold for a loss or broke even and are now cursing the company like they stole their money and went bankrupt. Here is your lesson, be patient. 

AYTU

-Has a CEO that sold his last company valued at $1b

-Company on the NASDAQ

-Multiple products on the market that target various billion dollar markets

-Had a 500% increase in revenue from 2018 to 2019, totaling their revenue to near $50m due to mergers with two pharma companies (Cerecor &amp; Innovus)

-Currently has $60m cash on hand

-USA distribution license of two companies for COVID-19 rapid testing, one is a massive biotech chinese company. The other is also reputable and has various markings(CE, FDA philipines, HSA &amp; NMPA). Already confirmed order of 2.1m test kits.

-COVID-19 product has been delivered to customers - so it's not just orders or hopes that they'll be provided. Initial 100k test kits have already been distributed, while 500k are in USA pending clearance. This is not to include the 1 million that have been ordered and accepted by the manufacturer. 

-Worldwide distribution license of Healight, a medical device that can kill many viruses/bacterias including coronavirus via UV light. This is the first of its kind and has been in development since 2016, awaiting patent approval. We can expect some data/research on this very soon.

DECN

-Apparently has a COVID-19 product that is pending FDA approval/acknowlegement. We don't have any other details besides its supposedly ""perfect technology"" and takes ""10-15 seconds"". They expect to sell hundreds of millions of these kits.

Description:

David’s Tea is out of Canada, which sells tea and tea accessories. DTEA started in 2008 and became a public company four years ago. DTEA currently has over 2,500 drugstore, grocery stores, and individual David Teas stores in just Canada selling David’s Tea products. DTEA will have the potential for future partnerships and more distributors, including more drugstore and grocery stores. Davids Tea has over 100 different teas and has the most extensive collection of organic teas in North America. DTEA allows people to take better care of their health, and the store associates are very knowledgeable, as well as the information given on their website where you can purée different tea products. Tea is the second most popular drink in the world. DTEA was also ranked high in polling and research with customer satiation and quality products within Canada.


Potential 2019-2020 Catalyst 


-Heavenly focus on wholesale and online sales 
-Additional stores in the wholesale channel
-Expect an increase of teabags sales in early 2020
-Provide food products in stores
-Continuing to strengthen management team
-Product innovation 
-Continuing to enhance the customer experience in stores and online


Financials (as of Sept. 30th, 2019)


-Sales are down 10% from last year which could be the result of discounted tea and expensive inventory
-Wholesale and e-commerce sales are up 14% this quarter
-Cash burn is only 1.7 Million this quarter compared to 20.9 millionaire in Q3 of 2018
-28 million cash on hand
-Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.34; GAAP EPS of -0.42
-Revenue of 39.49M (-9.6% Y/Y)


Authors Take On Finances:


DTEA has taken steps to grow the company and hopefully become a profitable company. Sales in stores have decreased, but they have increased in e-commerce and wholesale channels, which could be a driving factor to produce a profitable company with greater online adoption and the increase in popularity in grocery chains.


Bull Thesis:


DTEA has the potential to reach their all-time high of $29.60, but they have a long way to achieve this. Insiders own most of the outstanding shares, and there have been no insider sales. Most insiders have purchased shares at high prices. The CEO (Joel Silver) purchased shares at $20.20 and owns about 50% of total outstanding shares.


Bear Thesis:


DTEA Reported that one of its significant expenses was a severance package, which is not good news. The stock also got recently downgraded by BidaskScore. The company also produces negative income for the past four years since going public. The in-store sales are down, and they will need to provide a solution to this problem. In Q3, DTEA discontinued much tea at 50-90% off, which possibly impacted the Q3 earnings. Also, having an Earnings Call late Friday without an announcement is not the best way to handle that, and I believe they gave a weak IR.


Authors Note:


DTEA is a high-risk stock, and we could see a further drop in stock price, but I believe this company has room to grow, and with their increase in e-commerce, grocery and drug chains carrying their products is positive. I think if they develop relationships with more companies or build partnerships and possibly release THC products or alcoholic drinks, we could see an increase in stock price. At the current closing price of $1.50 as of December 23rd, this stock could easily be used as a swing trade or long term hold.",2020-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g8x8yv/dtea_a_quality_post_wrote_awhile_about_but_this/

PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. is a biotechnology company developing cellular  therapies for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary  cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as  “Cell-in-a-Box®.” This technology will be used as a platform upon which  therapies for several types of cancer and diabetes are being developed. 

 Technology May Be a Game Changer in Treating Pancreatic Cancer. 

Its  therapy for cancer involves encapsulating genetically engineered human  cells that convert an inactive chemotherapy drug into its active or  “cancer-killing” form. Its therapy for Type 1 and 2 diabetes involves  encapsulating a human cell line that has been genetically engineered to  produce and release in-sulin in response to the levels of blood sugar in  the human body. 

 It’s also involved with the CV-19 issue with diagnostics kits. Pharmacyte  Biotech could take the lead with what could be a much more accurate  version of the CV-19 diagnostic kit. In fact, these testing kits are  reportedly 10 times more sensitive than the other tests being used to  detect the virus.",2020-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g90i3m/pmcb_moving_quickly_towards_fda_approval/

59,What caused Valeant Pharmaceuticals to drop 90%?,g8zhqs,momchilandonov,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g8zhqs/what_caused_valeant_pharmaceuticals_to_drop_90/,1,1,"Hi All,

(Yes I googled before making this post and yes Google doesn't return nice results with free access)

Just watched Netflix Dirty Money S1E3 about Valeant Pharmaceuticals and I don't understand why the stock dropped so much and didn't recover? It doesn't make any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The company didn't do anything illegal as it turns out the USA laws are so bad you can increase the price of a life saving drug 50-60 times in a day and get away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin Shkreli was NOT sued about the price increase neither did the former CEO of Valeant. I read the Wikipedia article and it looks like USA couldn't sue him for the price increase so they used some vague claims about securities fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

Bad news and pointing fingers drop stock prices I get it. The problem here is that in reality he company made TONS of profits legally so in the end it should still have a decent amount of value.

&amp;#x200B;

I can give you great comaprison - VW dirty diezel scandal from the first episode - the company suffered a miserable 25% stock price drop or something like that when it was a known fact it LIED and was actually SUED for multiple serious crimes. Logic says VW should be almost wiped out from US market yet it miraculously recovered. On the other hand Valeant lost 90% without being sued and without having to return pills back to warehouses like VW had to do with 560 000 cars in USA alone which is absurd losses when you think about it!

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing Valeant did was lying about it's sales increasing however this is even debatable as it did increase in profits a ton however the amount of consumers was the same or less (I don't see how this could be big of a deal to investors if the company still had great profits?!). In the end the fair value of a company is highly related to the free cash flow and P/E ratio. Decreasing the shape price but still having tons of profit would make an unrealisticly low P/E ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Insurance companies suffered heavy losses so they simply increased the price of insuring - nothing wrong with that as increasing drug's price 50-60 times in a single day is totally legal.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at how much Facebook was being pointed at by congress/news etc. - stock was and is still pretty solid regarless of the tons of manipulations/scams/lies etc. and those are actually involving breaking rules/laws.

&amp;#x200B;

The only think I can think off is health insurance companies putting a ban on Valeant HOWEVER this doesn't change the fact that if you are dying you will buy their pills when there are no other alternatives!

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the news in a timeline - zero lawsuits against Valeant! When you think about it theoretically couldn't Valeant sue the sh\*t out of USA government and news/media about false claims/bad image? If all they did was legal I don't see a reason to ruin the company and using it as a political/voting game (Hilary Clinton) and the power of the media.

I logged into Schwab to see how BBRW was faring. On the Friday before there had been significant level 2 trading by market makers which had kept the price low. I didn’t love it, but it was a necessary evil. When the big boys move, us small fish make money riding the waves. 

Everything seemed in order, volume was on pace for another record day, prices were climbing. But then IT appeared. A 10,000 share ask at 0.021. 

“Oh no,” I thought, “that looks like some 10k shuffle shenanigans.” Surely the market makers had gotten their fill on Friday?

Being a follower of science, I decided to test my theory. I placed a bid for 10,000 shares at $0.020, higher than any other bid on the market, and waited and watched. It didn’t fill instantly like Schwab had warned me, it just sat there. 10 minutes went by and nobody had sold me their shares so I canceled my order.

I looked at the volume metrics once more. 100,000 shares had traded hands while my bid remained unfilled. Yet there it sat unchanged,the 10,000 share ask at $0.021, it’s perfectly even share count glinted mockingly. I watched the buy volume increase another 100k, yet still the ask would not die. $0.019 bids were stacking up below, up to 190,000 shares now, pleading to be filled. Yet the 10,000 share ask refused to budge.

Given the state of the market, Nordic can charge nearly $70,000 per day for ship usage, Hansson said, who counts big oil companies such as Exxon, Mobil and British Petroleum among its customers.

“We are making a lot of money at this time, improving our balance sheet tremendously, and I have never seen such a strong market,"" Herbjørn Hansson, CEO of the Bermuda-based tanker company.

Nordic, which has a $861 million market cap, watched its stock more than double in roughly the past month. Shares are up almost 19% to $5.85 year-to-date, performing much better than most of its competitors in the industry
