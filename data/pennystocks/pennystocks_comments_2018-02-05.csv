Jesus man.. so hostile.  If you knew me, you wouldn't say I am pumping stocks.  First off, I help run a penny stock training sub reddit.  https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyStockTraining/  

We have never pumped a stock.  We literally offer free knowledge to new investors and help people for free learn how to trade and basic strategies.  

I also announced PNTV before it jumped 30% in a week.  https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7osm81/a_case_for_pntv/

You gotta relax bro.  I am fine with you asking questions, but the way you are coming at me is not cool.  

So now lets address some of your concerns in an orderly fashion.  

&gt;On yahoo it shows they are based in London and not San Fransico.  

I am afraid that your information is outdated...   Why don't you check the actual company website and see where their contact is?

http://www.droneguarder.com/contacts/

&gt;Founded in 2017 in San Francisco, DroneGuarder is committed to security because we know what’s most important to you. As a company founded by security experts, we’re passionate when it comes to keeping people safe. We strive to create innovative, simple solutions for every day – solutions that fit into your schedule and lifestyle.

They do also have an address in London. 

&gt;They also only have 1 full time employee.

They have also increased by 23% in a 5 day period.  I don't discriminate when it comes to making money.   

&gt; Looks like you're pumping a piece of garbage to me. 

I am not a pumper, but you can believe whatever you want.  Many people on this sub know me and know that I literally help people for free and show some of the trades I like.  

&gt;The volume isn't popping either, it's below the average and it's mainly selling nonetheless.

See the pops?  This is how you make money in the market, play the small pops and get out with 15% gains.  

I don't know why you are so angry.  If you don't like it, simply move along.  ",2018-02-05

I am going to keep this very polite.  I do not need to include proof of where they are located in the post.  The post is not about where they are located.

Why are you so angry?  Seriously what happened to you?  

&gt;I'm in no way trying to troll you. 

Telling me that I am supposed to post proof of the company location is a very troll thing to do.   Continuing to harass me even though you have been proven wrong on everything is a very troll thing to do.  The way you accuse me of being a pumper is a very troll thing to do.  

&gt;You never answered my question about their excess of locations but lack of employees. 

I don't know every thing about the company.  Why don't you look it up if you are so curious?  I don't have to spoon feed you and hold your hand through doing research do I?  And I don't need to know all the ins and outs of a company to make money.  Especially if i am holding for just a day or two.  Since I have to walk you through how to research, ill give you a hint to your question... go to their about us page...  

&gt;Your information is iffy

And yours was incorrect... so... 

&gt;and when I called you out you took extreme offense

Well you incorrectly called me out, and then still act like a complete ass when proven incorrect.  Calling someone a pumper who is not one is grounds for provocation.  And yeah, I do take offense to that.  I have put a lot of time and effort into helping people and you are the person that makes people like us stop helping people.  Yes I do take offense to you calling me a pumper because its childish, naive, and just wrong.  

&gt;when I just trying to save everyone the trouble of finding the exact same information I did 

Had you simply asked in a sincere way, we could have researched it together.  But you did not.  

&gt;Stop looking at me as if I'm trying to troll you and instead look at your lack of judgement.

You are still trolling me now.  Literally everything you wrote here is trolling me. 

I am not sure what your problem is with me.  If you find a better stock, please post it.  When was the last time you posted a stock for everyone that you thought was a good buy?

Jaguar Health Inc. (Nasdaq: JAGX) is a California-based pharmaceutical company that also develops gastrointestinal products.

Its product Mytesi is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/Aids who use drugs in an attempt to control HIV infection.

And aside from human medications, Jaguar is also helping dogs and horses…

For animals, Jaguar's lead prescription drug candidate is Canalevia. It is a canine-specific formula that will treat various forms of diarrhea in dogs.

Jaguar also has Equilevia in its pipeline, which will provide ""total gut health"" for equine athletes. Equilevia will help fight off ulcers, which are predominant in performance horses.

In 2005, 97% of performance horses in a study had either gastric or a colonic ulcer, according to BusinessWire.com.

With all these revenue sources, Aegis Capital Corp. has a big prediction for the JAGX stock price…

In the next 12 months, Aegis Capital Corp. projects the JAGX stock price will climb to $1.25 per share. From today's opening price of $0.12, that's a potential profit of 941.66%.
