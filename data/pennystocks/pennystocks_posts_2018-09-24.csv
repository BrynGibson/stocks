8,How to Spot an RTO Cannabis Shell,9iiuhp,Mudruck1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9iiuhp/how_to_spot_an_rto_cannabis_shell/,1,0,"So I spent the last week trying to examine  patterns for RTOs that turned from a free trading stock to a cannabis  company (almost always a halt/delist in between). In almost every case,  it worked out advantageously to get in early. After studying a sample of  around 10 Reverse Take Overs (RTOs) of cannabis stocks, I found the  following patterns can be a precursor to a free trading jr mining/failed  microcap to becoming a cannabis operator:

1. Clearing of all operating assets ([see here](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/561350/Shareholders/Change+In+Shareholder+Approval+Requirements+For+Certain+TSXVListed+Issuers+Undertaking+A+Change+Of+Business+Or+Reverse+Takeover)).
2. Paying off of debts.
3. Upcoming proxy w/vote to do a reverse split (or shares already underneath 10m).
4. Upcoming proxy w/vote to delist (many of these companies downgrade to CSE during the halt).
5. Change of management w/placeholder management team with history in RTOs and cannabis.

Not  all of these need to be there. The most common signs you are looking at  an RTO is that 1,2 and 3 have either been accomplished or are in the  process of being accomplished.

To be  clear, it isn‚Äôt a riskless trade. There are cases where RTO‚Äôs don‚Äôt work  out if you get in early. But for the most part they work out very well  (at least from the sample I looked at), and some cases extremely well.    An article on Seeking Alpha from 2009, claims when a takeover agreement  is consummated, [the shell company three-month abnormal returns are 48.1%](https://seekingalpha.com/article/165252-does-it-make-sense-to-invest-in-a-shell-company).

Probably  the biggest risk, is that your investment gets halted or delisted and  the deal falls through, your investment is then in some sort of  purgatory for an indefinite period of time.",2018-09-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9iiuhp/how_to_spot_an_rto_cannabis_shell/
