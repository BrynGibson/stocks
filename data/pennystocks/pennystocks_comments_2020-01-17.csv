I sincerely hope they don't dilute before approval since I have a big ol pile of ITM calls that I'm holding to cash in on the increased buildup ahead of their PDUFA Feb 16th.,2020-01-17

9,JayceNugent,fem4vfu,/r/pennystocks/comments/epsqgj/agrx_short_thesis_tell_me_what_you_think/fem4vfu/,1,"Twirla is their birth control patch. Its nothing new. According to this Time.com page it was invented in 2002. That's 18 years ago! So I don't think there will be a problem with them getting FDA approval. I think their problem is actually selling something that has already been around for 18 years ! 

[http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934259\_1934672\_1934717,00.html](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934259_1934672_1934717,00.html)

Maybe I'm missing something, but in the case that this is a superior product from its competitors. WHICH I DONT THINK IS VERY PROBABLE. It still takes time and money to start selling your new product. Time and more importantly money the company does not have. Basically, in my mind the company has wasted millions of dollars in Research and Development expenses on something that already exists. 

On the flip side, maybe it is a bit better... maybe I am biased because I am short? That's why I posted this, so I can flesh out my ideas better. And update my thinking quicker if I am wrong.

For instance, I would not have been aware of the potential effect of their PDUFA on Feb 16th. Because In my mind its a gimme. Because patches have been around forever. Though maybe I am wrong and a positive FDA approval is not already priced into the stock.",2020-01-17

Buildups ahead of PDUFAs and high volatility sell offs immediately after. I agree it isn't a revolutionary product and its not really worth all that much, but the market doesn't usually make sense, especially in this sector. A dilution after the PDUFA or immediately before might make sense, though. It's pretty common, but I don't think the logistics are there for one a month out. 

They also took a downgrade to hold from Zack's this morning, but still have hit or strong buy from 6 other analysts. Cracks are definitley starting to show. I'd plan to partially exit *before* the PDUFA, just to be safe. For me, I have 10 2/21 calls at the $2.5 strike price that I've got a standing sell order issued for. Plan to sell 7 at a small proft, move that into shares with a tight stop loss in place, and sell the other 3 calls on the news.

The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including advancing preparations for a planned New Drug Application (NDA) filing to the FDA for intravenous rigosertib in second-line higher-risk MDS in 2020, and advancing preparations for commercialization if the NDA is approved. The Company surpassed 90% of the required enrollment of the INSPIRE Trial in November 2019 and anticipates reporting topline data in the first half of 2020, following full enrollment and reaching the number of required survival events. With the additional expected proceeds from the offering and the proceeds from recent warrant exercise, the Company believes that it has the sufficient funds to extend operations and ongoing trials late into the first quarter of 2021.


Key word: commercialization

Seems they are running a drug trial and it‚Äôs soon to be finalized and approved.

About Myelodysplastic Syndromes

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are conditions that can occur when the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow become dysfunctional and thus produce an inadequate number of circulating blood cells. It is frequently associated with the presence of blasts or leukemic cells in the marrow.  This leads to low numbers of one or more types of circulating blood cells, and to the need for blood transfusions. In MDS, some of the cells in the bone marrow are abnormal (dysplastic) and may have genetic abnormalities associated with them.  Different cell types can be affected, although the most common finding in MDS is a shortage of red blood cells (anemia).  **Patients with higher-risk MDS may progress to the development of acute leukemia.**",2020-01-17
