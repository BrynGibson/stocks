One thing that may help you guys in my experience. The first tattoo was done with an older laser. My current removal is done by a PICO wave removal laser. It takes half the sessions and the scarring/blistering is almost non-existent. The PICO is a far superior product and it also reduces the cost of removal by cutting down the time. 

I know this is r/pennystocks not a tattoo sub, I just wanted to provide some clarificationthay may help in future decisions. I see my remover every 3-4 months and she always tells me about new tech.",2019-12-22
