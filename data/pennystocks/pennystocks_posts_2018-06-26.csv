ORLANDO, Fla., June 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Elev8 Brands, Inc. (OTC Pink:VATE), a holding company focused on the commercial development of hemp and CBD-based products including hemp coffee, tea, CBD salve, CBD Lotions and CBD Tinctures that target the health and wellness markets, is pleased to announce the acquisition of L&amp;P Cold Brew, LLC from Blessed Bean Coffee, a Florida Limited Liability Company. The acquisition allows Elev8 Brands to enter the ready to go market, which according to Food Business News, the global sales of ready to go coffee and tea market in 2015 was $71.4 billion.

Elev8 Brands acquired the newly formed L&amp;P Cold Brew to launch its new cold brew product line and to make it a more versatile company adding additional revenue through vertical markets.

""We have had tremendous success with our Blessed Bean Coffee company and have been eager to expand our business into the cold brew sector”, stated Robie Leavitt, Managing Member of Blessed Bean Coffee, ""Working with the Elev8 team has given us the ability to open up a new division of our already profitable business to provide cold brew to our existing customers as well as the ability to create new customers from this high demand market of ready to go coffee drinks.”

According to a report by Grand View Research, Inc. the global ready to drink tea and coffee market size is expected to reach 116.13 billion USD by 2024. US Sales alone in 2017 were over $38.1 million which is up over 460&amp;#37; from 2015.

Ryan Medico, CEO of Elev8 Brands, Inc. stated, ""As we see the market for ready to go coffee and tea drastically increasing, we must jump on the opportunity to develop our own cold brew coffee. Of course, our coffee will differentiate itself amongst the others as Elev8 will infuse organic hemp protein.""

Elev8 Brands is also pleased to announce that within thirty days its audit should be complete per Ben Borgers of BF Borgers CPA PC. Elev8 Brands has submitted its second round of information and will soon be completing its application process to up-list to the OTCQB.

Medico concluded, ""This is a very exciting time for the company. We are seeing and experiencing growth in all subsidiaries from private label hemp coffee and CBD to new retail accounts and acquisitions. Elev8 Brands is set to have its biggest quarter yet.""

9,$AVMXY - lots of near term and long-term upside,8u2g2r,the__dentist,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8u2g2r/avmxy_lots_of_near_term_and_longterm_upside/,10,12,"Hi all, 

I'm a dentist (oral surgeon) and I specifically have interacted with burn surgeons who have used their RECELL product before during investigational studies and overseas. I have no intention to pump this stock, but I would say that if anyone wants to take a look into this company and what they have to offer, then I think that would be a great idea. **I do not support you purchasing this stock, and I also do not support you not purchasing this stock.** **Your decision is entirely up to you, and at this point everything is mere speculation without FDA approval on their PMA.** The stock ticker is on the OTC Market as AVMXY, or if you want to buy on the ASX Australian market then the ticker is AVH. **Disclosure: I own shares of AVMXY and am long**. 

With that said, I believe there is a lot of upside. The company is currently valued at $73mm and they are awaiting a PMA from the FDA expected in Q3 2018. Their recent conference call said that they are ""highly likely"" to gain FDA approval. In fact, the FDA straight up told them to stop the control-arm (split thickness grafting) during their clinical trials because it was producing significantly worse results compared to their RECELL product. If anyone has ever been burned, you would know that Doctors often take a graft (called split-thickness grafting) from your healthy skin to cover up your burn mark. Well the problem with that is 1) your destroying healthy skin, 2) scarring is ugly and immenent, and 3) the worst part is that if a patient has a large burn, then it is highly unlikely that doctors can take a graft big enough to cover their burn. Their RECELL device allows doctors to take a graft about the size of a postage stamp, extract the stem cells from it on-site (takes about \~30 min) and then spray those cells on the graft site and the burn site. Clinical trials have shown that scarring is significantly improved and donor site is significantly smaller. There are no serious adverse events associated with RECELL either, which means that the FDA IS VERY LIKELY TO APPROVE IN THE 3Q 2018! In fact, in 2017 every PMA application that was accepted to be reviewed by the FDA was approved. That's a 100&amp;#37; success rate. 

Financials also have a high upside. Upon FDA approval, BARDA (US Government Division) will execute the remainder of their contract with them worth $64mm (almost their entire market cap) to stockpile their RECELL devices for future disasters. Furthermore, the company has a very strong balance sheet - $0 in debt! There is some near term dilution ahead, but it is to a private investor and it is so they can take advantage of launching into the US market during the 4Q 2018 and 1Q 2019 - which is technically the best time to launch, because during the winter hospitals experience the highest volume of burn victims. 

On a macro scale, the entire healthcare industry is taking a strong shift to ""paying for value"" and finding ways to increase quality of care while decreasing cost of care. The company developed an economic model and determined that RECELL would save a Burn Center on average \~$12mm/year. This is a direct result of RECELL application leading to quicker healing times, faster patient discharge, less patient complications, less patient pain, and higher patient satisfaction.  To put this in laymen terms - a large burn that covers your entire arm would require burn surgeons to cut a section of your healthy skin large enough to cover your burn. Now instead of your burn being the only thing that needs to heal, you also have a section of flesh from your ass or your thigh that needs to heal. Doctors have to monitor both areas, apply dressings and antibiotics to both areas, and prevent infections. This all leads to  longer healing times, worse scarring, and longer stays in the hospital. Unless you live under a rock, you know that hospital real estate is costly by the minute. So any opportunity that allows hospital administration to get patients out of there quicker is likely to be welcomed with open arms. This is why I firmly believe that RECELL will have a HUGE positive impact to add value to burn victims healthcare, while saving hospitals and third-party payers millions of dollars. The only downside I obviously see at this time is dilution coming in July, but this is a good thing because they need the money to scale their manufacturing and sales force. I mean shit, there are already a billion shares out in the ASX market, so I think that this dilution will have a minimal effect. I personally also don't like that they are on the OTC market and are based out of Australia - this is the only company I have ever invested in that was on the OTC market and on the ASX. I think they belong on the NASDAQ but that is not the case with them, unfortunately. Please share your thoughts, and thanks for you time!
