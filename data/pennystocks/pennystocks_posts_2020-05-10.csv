some of you may have seen me post about Riot Blockchain a few days ago, ive also commented about RIOT and MARA the passed few days. Since then I’ve received DMs thanking me for the suggestion. Thats what the community is for, I researched this play for days, and wanted to share it with you all because I’ve made money from other users on this sub. Thank you for that.

I just saw a news article on RHood about RIOT, posted a few hours ago. Usually the companies in these articles are the big blue chips, banks, airlines, etc. but there it is, RIOT


I saw comments thursday and friday saying that it was too late, or that they’re going to dump after the halvening mon and tues.

Truth is, Bitcoin and crypto is only going to go up, according to most experts. It’s not too late, theres great long term AND short term gains in crypto mining companies right now.

27,FET,ggu2u8,Bogashi,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ggu2u8/fet/,1,61,"FET

Here are some reasons to buy FET when the market opens.

- FET currently has a very strong bull evidence 

- FET currently has a score of 52 while the rest of its sector is around 37 which can lead to an increase in price

- Insiders rate FET a 64 which is pretty good considering that it’s an oil company 

- FET has had a massive increase in volume recently and more and more people are looking at the stock each day which can mean more people will buy on Monday when the market opens

- The 52 week high was around $5 so am increase in at least 50% should be easy for the stock to do considering all the positives 

- Analysts set a price target of $1 for FET while some others have set a target of $3

- SCF bought around 17 million shares

FET right now is a great buy and has front bullish indicators

38,LEXAGENE ($LXXGF) medium term play thoughts,gh1x7z,Namtsok9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gh1x7z/lexagene_lxxgf_medium_term_play_thoughts/,1,7,"Howdy,

Lexagene ($LXXGF) is a small Canadian company that I was alerted to by several veterinarians. Lexagene is making an on-site CoVid-19 test than can do multiple tests in an hour, instead of the 24-36 hr off site testing. I think this is a damn good company and I'm hoping this medium term play profits before Q4, and shows that there are more to penny stocks than pump and dumps.

Today I'm going to try to rationalize my heavy investment on a friggin penny stock. 

**TLDR:** [**EZ PowerPoint**](https://lexagene.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LexaGene-INVESTOR-Presentation_April23web.pdf)

**Company:**

LexaGene is a biotechnology company developing a fully automated pathogen detection platform for use at the site of sample collection, which offers unprecedented ease-of-use, sensitivity, and breadth of pathogen detection. LexaGene’s technology aims to transform the way organizations prevent and diagnose disease in multi-billion dollar markets such as human clinical diagnostics, food safety, veterinary diagnostics, water quality monitoring, aquaculture pathogen surveillance, and more.

LexaGene’s patented microfluidic system was invented by company founder and CEO, Dr. Jack Regan, who was a lead scientist in developing a predecessor instrument designed for bio-warfare surveillance that was adopted by the Department of Homeland Security for the BioWatch Program and a second R&amp;D instrument that was designed for detecting respiratory pathogens from nasal swab samples. The development of these instruments was supported by $20M in government funding.

**Product:**

LexaGene is developing a genetic analyzer for automated pathogen detection that is designed to be placed at the site of sample collection – to quickly detect multiple pathogens at once with sensitivity and specificity – and return results in about 1 hour.

The LX Genetic Analyzer is being designed for syndromic testing in veterinary diagnostics and human clinical diagnostics, as well as food safety testing, water quality monitoring, and other markets that need critical answers in less time.

The technology’s open-access feature allows researchers in biotech, pharma, and academic laboratories to customize their testing, whether it is to detect rare infectious diseases, screen for cancer, or perform mRNA expression profiling.

The open-access feature also makes the system uniquely poised to become a critical part of preventing the spread of emerging strains of new infectious diseases to help avert a pandemic.

**Financials:**

[Recent Financial Reports](https://lexagene.com/financial-information/)

Lexagene has a small market cap of around \~50M. In April, warrants were exercised producing more cash flow. This company is cashflow negative without a product which is common in biotechs.

**Timeline Highlights:      Q3**  

* FDA EUA Approval
* Manufacturing (announced partnership with [Ximedica](https://lexagene.com/release/2020/lexagene-provides-corporate-update-2/) 3/22/20)
* Sales (announced partnership with marketing firm [Native Ads NYC](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/23/2021353/0/en/LexaGene-Holdings-Proposes-to-Amend-Warrants-Terms-and-Announces-a-Strategic-Marketing-Promotional-Campaign.html) marketing firm)

**Board:** 

The most important decider of the future of a penny stock is the board. Judge for yourselves if this company has a legit website/director board and is not just another TTI/UAVS/ALPP pump and dump [HERE](https://lexagene.com/directors/).

**2nd Opinions:**

* [Yahoo board discussion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LXXGF/community?p=LXXGF)
* [Stockhouse board discussion](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=lxxgf)

**Summary:** 

Whole lot of big moves coming up in Q3, and we're in a slight dip. I would not be surprised if this is the last buying opportunity before news comes out about sales hires and manufacturing, or FDA approval. I've read the research papers and had research doctors who specialize in PCR and pathology look it over and convinced them that its a company to be watching. I've never done a DD before and I know this is all from their website, but hey I'm a geologist so do what you want with it I'm just introducing this to share with folks that help me makes a few bucks here and there.

I’m trying to understand a trailing stop limit order. 
I’m holding a stock and hoping it will rise on the recent news from yesterday and I want to follow the rise but be able to sell if it heads back down 

My understanding Is I set a dollar amount or percentage that follows the current price and changes as the price rises.
I trade with TD and it asks for a trigger delta and limit delta. 
Can someone help me understand the difference

1. Check earnings dates for stocks
2. Search what anaylsts think about Earning report of a particular stock you are interested in
3. Do you your little research ( how will it perform, will it beat estimates).  Tech and pharma stock tend to do better ER than others in this COVID crisis

107,SINO &amp; ARC Unique Chart analysis,gha7ih,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gha7ih/sino_arc_unique_chart_analysis/,3,16,"Happy moms to you all, folks. 

Been slightly busy but I did not forget to review overnight activity (normally I do every midnight or every other midnight). As usual, let's get down to business. I've noticed some overnight activity forming a cup &amp; or a breakout both ARC &amp; SINO something must be cooking up something. Both charts are attractive indeed but one stood out most than the other and you know me by now, I love curve-like charts or even outside charts; SINO ended the day after hours with a big candle on the intraday chart while on the daily seems to be more or less forming a cup aka moon shot pattern.

ARC is a commercial &amp; or printing services, SINO is a global shipping logistics part of air freight &amp; courier services.

**Questions below I will be answering**:

Are you buying these Monday or anytime soon? I would but I am taking a risk/reward chance holding NAKD at this time,

Are they short or short term? Short term.

When will this spike? Often times I get this question, again I can't stress this enough but things I call out or tickers I notice can happen today, tomorrow, next week, or even weeks. Take prime examples of BIOC, TNPX, TRPX, RTTR. No one in any shape or form can predict ""when"". The only thing you have control in a chaotic probability butterfly effect is your reliable charts/Resistance/Support.

What's the best entry/exit? All listed above making easy friendly and trader ""dummy"" ease.

Should I go long? Like the moderators have penny stocks, not all stocks are meant for long investing, they are meant to be short/short term.

If you had to choose both stocks, which one would you choose? Possibly SINO considering delivery/orders/courier is on the demand and up by +2.62% vs commercial printing services about roughly 0.90%.
