The hope is that the increase in volume up from a measly 300 and the drastic increase in price will get us on the top mover's chart on otc markets. I have noticed that people are watching this stock on other investing forums. People will see the increase in price and volume and it should create more interest for the stock.  Then we sell our shares at a price that is significantly higher than we purchased it. I am not trying to manipulate anyone, I am trying out what could end up becoming a very profitable trading strategy for all of us.",2019-05-19

11,calvin50,eo60bcy,/r/pennystocks/comments/bql8lr/pump_and_dump_for_friday_524/eo60bcy/,1,"When I scan for stocks to trade I look for a 5 percent increase and a relative value of 2 and an average volume of at least 500 thousand. 
    To get a 5 percent increase on the day 2 million shares will need to be bought . With holders selling the volume will go to 10 percent of the outstanding shares which is a volume of 4 million 
        This would probably take more than a week but if ( IF) a group could pour 800  to a million $ into a stock it would get some interest. But it would be short lived and there would be a real chance the group would lose more than it put in as it sold out sense everyone would be selling at the same time. 
     To pump a stock you don’t need money all you need is something good to say about it and then spread it all over social media . Without a dime you could sit and watch a stock slowly go up or down just because of the advertisement . But you’re still not manipulating the stock only the people 
Some pumpers don’t have any thing good to say they just start talking till the price starts moving then they sell the shares they bought to those who are buy into the fake news they started. 
     All and all you’re still just taking some newbies money that fell for it . I was a newby once I’m out",2019-05-19

You will see that there are many sell bids that are well above current market price. All we need to do is fulfill some of the high sell orders and the price will go up to the last price sold. Because the volume is so low the price is unlikely to correct any time soon. So we can maintain a much higher price than the stock deserves with very low leverage.",2019-05-19
13,calvin50,eo62y5v,/r/pennystocks/comments/bql8lr/pump_and_dump_for_friday_524/eo62y5v/,1,"Those are the sellers that you have to overcome. There the resistance. When there sell orders start hitting your buy order it will form a resistance or brake through and go to the next sell. 
      The volume has to go up with price to hit other scanners than your hope is they buy in because you still have to move 5 percent of the stock 
     The only advantage I see is the outstanding shares is 44 million so its possible but those sell orders are holders hoping it goes back up so they don’t lose money. At least some of them",2019-05-19
