Just look at the quarter over quarter sales, it is just incredible.

It will get on NASDAQ and will attract big player investors which will really get this thing moving.

Not sure what to make of this:

On one hand, I see this article, which talks about how Tesla wanted to buy John Burba's previous company Simbol for $325 million.

On the other hand, there's this story which talks about how Simbol went bankrupt..
