0,Pump and Dump Alert PNNX (IMHO),etlsx1,Agnia_Barto,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etlsx1/pump_and_dump_alert_pnnx_imho/,1,33,"PNNX grew from $0.00 to $0.62 in the last 6 months, and folks at investorshub are [freaking out](https://investorshub.advfn.com/Pennexx-Foods-Inc-PNNX-8854/) over it being larger than Amazon soon and becoming $10 before we know it. 

[Apparently](http://www.pennexx.net/index.html#how_it_works) they're building a network of prepaid debit cards that you load with cryptocurrency, but then can use to pay at a grocery store, while redeeming social media coupons. PNNX is planning to release details of their product [after the patent is submitted](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pennexx-foods-inc-pnnx-_we-are-now-current-and-looking-forward-to-activity-6622152732646129664-o0rO), but the product itself [next week](https://twitter.com/pennexx). No marketing or public announcment have been made in the news, apart from 3 LinkedIn posts, and a handful of Twitter posts. 

They [acquired](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/16/1930604/0/en/PNNX-Discloses-a-34-9-Million-NOL-and-Completes-Your-Social-Offers-Acquisition.html) Your Social Offers for $34Mil, which is basically an app for [targeted ads](https://www.wix.com/app-market/social-offers/overview), [Triple888Ligistics](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/10/23/1934198/0/en/PNNX-Acquires-Triple-888-s-Logistics-Inc-and-its-Intellectual-Property-Bit-Gift.html) that owns [bitcoin gift card company](https://twitter.com/giveabitgift) and hasn't been active in few years, and entered into partnership with [VistaMoney](https://vistamoney.com/) , who makes prepaid reloadable virtual cards. 

It does sound interesting and please do your own dd as well, but here are some of the risks and questions to consider: 

1) [Executive Team](http://www.pennexx.net/about.html#team) is questionable. [CMO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-sweet-66606a33/) for example is some lady from Florida, who used to own a company that made fur pillows out of your old fur coats. For a company that's launching cutting edge tech product might not be the best fit. 

2) Who is doing all the work? Based on my research I can only see 7 people working in Pennexx, Triple 888 logistics and VistaMoney combined. 

3) They might not end up making the product.

4) They might end up making the product, but noone is going to use it.

5) They end up making great product that everyone is using, but get shut down by Big Banks and the IRS immediately, because noone's gonna let this much money move around undocumented on prepaid cards.

With that being said, it seems like stock might continue growing. If you choose to invest, make sure you get out in time before the potential dump.",2020-01-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etlsx1/pump_and_dump_alert_pnnx_imho/

As you probably know, trading can be a lonely game, and not being able to collaborate with others after leaving my job in finance a few months ago kills me.

Just looking to meet up with other Detroit Metro traders in this micro-cap niche to collaborate with, bounce ideas off of, and maybe trade with!

The company hasn’t had a PR release since last year when it ran from .0016-.195 for a 12,087% run. They’ve added a couple of Directors from their competitors $UBER and $LYFT. They recently got pink current again causing some more volume to come in and now the party will officially kick off this week with the upcoming PR.

7,I'm not 'giving up' on stocks I just think I may have a better idea. Change my mind.,etph08,nomadtrader22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etph08/im_not_giving_up_on_stocks_i_just_think_i_may/,1,8,"OK so everyday I'm faced with a choice of say 10K stocks, so I start with my scanner and look for the gappers. The gappers are random they need to be researched and a bias formed and a plan put together but the news (if it has any) whether it's a PR or an SEC filling may or may not be deceiving only the people who are very familiar with that stock will know or should know. Then you have chatroom pumpers and the Level 2 spoofers plus let's not forget the market makers.. and the companies themselves who may just be trying to raise funds with an offering on the shelf ready for unsuspecting punters, or not! maybe it looks bad but goes to the moon anyway who knows right? or it goes to the moon just because it's bad but turns into a short squeeze..  \\0/!

This is HARD work day in day out. Options or futures are still vulnerable to these shenanigans and different points of view because they are based on the underlying security. 

Now, when I said I may have a better idea I don't mean I actually invented it I should have said I see a better way IMHO. Trade just 500 of the worlds best companies or more precisely one ETF the $SPY - but indirectly. 

If your sole focus was the SPY then by definition your expertise on it would build up by the day instead of starting from zero each morning. Can the SPY be manipulated.. nah it does 300M in volume a day some times. But the SPY is expensive and some time does not move much which is why I say 'indirectly' the UVXY ETF is $12 and mirrors the SPY candle for candle but inverse and moves 3x the SPY great for when the SPY is having a pull back or the much predicted correction.. then there is the TQQQ ETF for longing the SPY on up days which is also 3x but one third the price at $100. I've never been a fan of indicators but have to say they seem to work better on the SPY the SPY is predictable or should I say more predictable than random stocks. Yea you can trade the SPY with options &amp; futures contracts or e-minis with their strike prices and 'Greeks' whatever that means, and they have limited liability but I'm just a simple day trader and I have hard stops I don't want to be boxed in by the CME Group.

Obviously I'm one of many to arrive at the same idea would love to hear from others who have tried it think it's bollocks or love it, or could refine it in some way have I missed a trick here?",2020-01-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etph08/im_not_giving_up_on_stocks_i_just_think_i_may/
