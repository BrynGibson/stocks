TNKE has tanked hard the last few days. Good news is it is still seeing 42 million volume so it is not totally forgotten and is right at its support level pre supernova. Will be watched for recovery and has some news behind it. They keep trying to pump the stock so it may move in the morning. This is a high risk high reward for tomorrow. 

I really wish I held SSOF into yesterday. Turned to be fantastic today. We will see if tomorrow is the turning point where it starts going down or bounces and keeps going. Heavily watched. But they have a history of fraud issues...but the chart. Wonder if it will run anyways. It is the world of penny stocks. The IHUB page makes it look like a risky long. 

ANDI is back to the watchlist as it is proving itself. The only question is if this is a bounce or it will keep falling. It has repeating patterns and mid day plays. Top one for now. 

FUSZ just runs and runs and runs. Not terrible for speed but I do not see an end in sight and do not know why it has run this long. Is another interesting long. Good safe play. 

VATE is recovering and may do a double top. Thing moves like molasses though. But it seems to be a relatively safe long in a small position for a few days. 

HMPQ is an interesting one with some actual business and stability to it. Legalization is getting closer and this has seen some sales already in certain areas. Seeing some serious volume. 

DPW may be recovering. We will see. Overnight watcher for how it finishes. But it is not moving fast at all. 

CELZ is starting to get into questionable territory as there aren't the dip buys anymore and any dip is followed by a continuous dip. Will be watching it but it may not be as good anymore. 

CPXP idk what to make of it. May return to its highs and not on my main radar. 

HMNY is risky as hell but I think it could bounce a bit tomorrow. Emphasis on watch. ",2018-04-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8dkr29/watchlist_for_friday_ssof_andi_tnke_fusz_vate_hmpq/

Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. would become SEC Reporting and Expand Governance

April 20th, 2018 – Blue Diamond Ventures Inc, (OTC PK: BLDV) Chicago, IL.

Cann10 North America Holdings LTD. and Blue Diamond Ventures Inc. consider the benefits of a Merger.

Cann10 North America and BLDV revealed today that part of the initial share purchase agreement, signed in December, includes a path to merge the companies into a single stronger entity.

The potential deal would be one of the first mergers into an operating OTC PK company in the cannabis industry and although the “Triple Package” of Foreign ownership, Non-Reporting Pink Sheet, and Marijuana make for a bit of complication, the Biotech access that comes with Cann10 make it worth the effort.

The Alliance will deliver Israeli Cannabis Technology and Innovation from Israel to North America, the partnership with AMS has remained central to this process and when the export from Israel opens up, we will deliver on the original promise to combine forces with AMS as well.”.

A new product line “Cannareet” was released this week in Israel by Cann10, these formulations were created in the Cann10 Labs and represent the latest combination of GMP manufacturing and strict Israeli approvals that will be made available to the Global Market.

About BLDV:
Blue Diamond Ventures, Inc. is a diversified customer centric Management / Holding Company; Blue Diamond Ventures, Inc. seeks opportunities in medical cannabis markets and is driven by critical thinking, the scientific method and compassionate ways to deliver sustainable results

About Cann10:

I don't see this one mentioned too often here.

This is a cannabis company that is operating in the USA at a profit already. Quoting a news article: ""In the United States, MPX has business interests in dispensaries and cultivation facilities in four states: Arizona, Nevada, Maryland and Massachusetts."" As per their investor presentation they also have target jurisdictions of Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio.

It has a large facility in Owen Sound, Ontario that is in the process of getting licensed to produce cannabis legally in Canada. It also has just agreed to purchase Canveda, an already licensed Canadian grower in preparation for legalisation.
