My follows aren’t really compiled of traders, investors, resources, so if anyone has twitter with handles they would recommend, please do. 

I ain’t talking about spammers either with every ticker as their hashtags — Quality with quantity. 

Much appreciated. ",2019-02-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ar3izs/twitter_gang/
