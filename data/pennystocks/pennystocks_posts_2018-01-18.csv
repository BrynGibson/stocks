On so no longer a penny stock, but still not badly priced at $5.60/share.
So I was wondering why it seemed to not be moving at all the last few days and found that trading has been temporarily suspended. I was a bit confused by this as the company is starting to grow, actually turning profits and has been increasing production from their main lithium mine. 

Then I found it, a news story from yesterday that I missed. Toyota has announced that it is buying a 15% stake in Orocobre for USD$232million! Together they are planning a $279mill investment in the site to increase production capacity from 17,500 tons (10% global demand) to 42,500 tons / year.
From Toyota's end they want to assure a stable supply of lithium for automobile production.

I was talking yesterday on someone else's post about the ever increasing demand for lithium. This same article claims global demand will double by 2021.
