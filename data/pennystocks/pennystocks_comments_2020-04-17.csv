Personally I like those more than single day trades. Feels more stable and real than a pump and dump, not as intense fear when i sit and watch the process.

For three day trading. I like to go hard on analysis and news.  Then I look at social media / here.

Let's use Adxs. Looking at ADXS, you can see it got sh!% on from 2/19 to 3/19. There was a point at the end of feb where it rebounded over a few days then tanked.

 So, your looking to buy and sell over a few days preferring gains, find something that's on a red run but looks like it could turn around.  find one, look at its news, is it death or a wound, how serious is it compared to the loss its shown, example: a failed fda test is death and everyone's leaving look up ipcif, if you can check if its oversold do that, compare 1 day, 10day, and 3 to 6 months depending on relevant price.  How are the ranges over time, and volume patterns, some of the worst days in adxs had no volume, the best days and stable days had mild to ridiculous. If you think it's still iffy, only invest a quarter to half on day 1 but only at the beginning and/or end, day 2 you've seen prices change can you buy in cheaper or more expensive, buy less at more or more at less or wait.  A bad thing is getting in on a green day, a couple cents recovery and you hop in, it tanks 5c then the next day and the next. Sometimes just cause, othertimes news, etc. 

That's my system. I've lost plenty being stubborn on exiting, but I've made plenty just biding and buying slowly.  I am not saying what I do works. That's just what I do.  I hate myself for March.",2020-04-17

It could drop to the mid .60s imo so be prepared. Next time this shows signs of a run even if it only goes to the mid .80s I would just cut your losses while you can so you‚Äôre not stuck bagholding for a long while over $150 or so. Much better trades out there you could be making.",2020-04-17

That was enough for me to sell at a fairly big loss.

  This is such a frustrating company, every PR was so unclear, even the one they released today it still seems like they aren't sure what's going to happen.

What most people don't realize is that the woman didn't actually sue for millions, she just wanted her medical bills paid to cover the insanely painful and expensive skin grafting she needed on her genitals from third degree burns from McDonalds coffee, which was company standard to keep **insanely** hot. She was awarded that money because a jury of her peers had deemed she deserved it after what McDonalds had done to her (and she was not the first to be injured by McDonalds coffee, either).

What happened is a bunch of scummy lawyers from McDonalds, and a bunch of scummy reporters worked together to downplay the situation and demonize the woman who was suing. They started the narrative to manipulate the public. At the time, people hadn't actually been sue happy sue happy, but because McDonalds attorneys and their buddies within the press spun it that way, and made it sound like the woman was some legal predator exploiting the system, it made everyone THINK you can sue for anything in America and make bank.

So, because the media and McDonalds lawyers made it sound like you could sue for anything and get money, people started suing for anything they could.... but you don't actually win in those scenarios. You can sue, but you're just wasting your time and money. 

So, there's a short history lesson for everyone today.

629,Nillnornull,fnpsp8r,/r/pennystocks/comments/g351u5/cbli_looking_good_for_a_spike_i_think/fnpsp8r/,1,"Ok, so for me.
I think, and am no expert and have no education in this field, that it's kinda a buy.

On the 3 month chart going back to before the spike to now, I can see that it's almost a buy.
I used a couple different indicators.

On ichimoku it's good besides the tenkan line not passing the kijun line. This implies it's still a negative trend. And these lines are below the cloud which, though a positive cloud is still a weak trend. The price needs to spike up to meet the kijun or stay stable to lower the kijun and cloud.  Then the RSI and trin have just met signaling the end of the down trend and if they pass eachother and continue to diverge its bullish.  Looked at chaikins ADO and money flow, both just crossed the change in trend. Aroon shows the down trend closing but unless the price picks up or stabilizes over next week its false.
3 month chart. I'd say in between 1.60-1.72

10day chart.
Automatically see the end of a cup and handle handle on April 10thish. So we could be seeing the base curve of a cup forming now. Ichi shows better ten and ki lines, but the cloud is negative but the lines are at the cloud, price needs to go up to produce a positive trend or else itll go back down.  Rsi/Trin are almost met, not the end of the down trend yet. Cmf and ado are negative from the price drop today below 1.75,  Aroon is middle ground. 
I say 1.55 to 1.70 in 

1 day chart. 
Ichi, ten and ki passed for short down trend on decline from 1.75 in the negative cloud. Price decline hurting the upward movement.  RSI/trin and the rest have diverged negatively.  But these negatives are perfect for buying if they dont downtrend hard. 
1.55-1.65.

Overall, it looks like a fight for a rise. Needs a heavy push? Could sink back down to 1.50 and lower if no faith / patience / bad news.",2020-04-17

I think it may have a chance to gap down to 3.75-3.8 area initially cause that seemed to be the 7am pattern where it would drop in the mornings but it may just continue to move up until open with how strong the news is. Then the profit takers will strike hard at anything above $5 and depending on how confident people are it may bounce back. More news with merger details would definitely help. I'm thinking of putting a small order in at $3.9 and if it takes it takes. Otherwise I'll see how strong the volume is at 7am. May wait till just before 9am to see how things go.,2020-04-17

They want you to think they already had high temp coffee to take away the negligence of the employee (who was a younger lady) that was upset to be asked to heat up the coffee and she put it in an industrial microwave for MINUTES.

This is one of the grossest things a mega corporation has ever done and honestly has set up many Americans to be led into shit they shouldnt.

I believe (thanks to McDonald's) its capped at like $250,000? Now, that doesnt include cost of bills and everything, but if McDonald's did this again, the most anyone could get, EVEN IF BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION, would only be entitled to $250,000 on top of their Bill's.

McDonald's corporate policy at the time was to keep all the coffee machines set to a ridiculously high temperature. The reasoning behind their policy was that a lot of people in offices would send 1 person to McDonalds to get coffee for everyone, so McDonalds policy was the keep coffee scolding hot, so that in those instances the coffee would still be hot when the courier returned to work with it.

And yea, i do think something happened with caps on damages, which is hilarious. The burn victim received somewhere around 2 million in punitive damages. This was decided on by a jury of her peers. The damages were a form of punishment to mcdonalds for their unsafe practices, and the line of thinking was that they would be docked for 2 days worth of coffee sales, and that the money should go to the victim, for obvious reasons.
