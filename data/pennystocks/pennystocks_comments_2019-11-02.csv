Also depends on whether you want to make money on the up swings or dips. Be careful with markets like these. You say consistent oscillation like it actually follows geometric patterns.

   As you can see there is a lot to learn . Go ahead open a paper trade account with a broker and use paper money to find the best way for you . I don‚Äôt recommend you use real money until you know the ends and outs . You can utube trading and learn how. Or even take some classes. But either way will take time and patience",2019-11-02
