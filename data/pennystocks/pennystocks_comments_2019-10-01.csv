4,MarcellusBoom,f23k9dt,/r/pennystocks/comments/dbov3f/so_tyme_took_a_dump_yesterday_and_i_cant_figure/f23k9dt/,1,It crossed the sma and middle bollinger bands signaling a switch in trend. RSI was at an over bought level too. But probably a pump and dump. Learn to use some technicals to support price movement. They arnt right all the time but can give you a better understanding of when not to buy. Wait at least a week for the down trend to cool off,2019-10-01
