Their only real product is for diabetics. An incurable condition that affects approx 10% of the US Population. 

Think about that. 

They’ve had 18 years to “break into the market”. 

Their desired customer base has the potential to use their product for their entire lives. That sounds like easy money.  

Despite that they were worth pennies a share. 


Their CEO is listed as the president and founder of two other companies in the medical industry despite having zero formal education in any medical related field. 

He’s been DECNs CEO for 7 years. 

And he’s such a great manager he can’t even keep them NASDAQ compliant. 

I personally have a hard time believing that a company that couldn’t make money selling a product for a condition that never goes away is suddenly going to become a pharma powerhouse because of the corona virus. 

But, I’ll keep tossing some play money at this thing, telling bad jokes and turning a profit knowing in a few months there will be another “to the moon” penny stock to turn and burn. 


If you think this is a company you can rely on to generate wealth for you in the long term go for it. 

I really hope everybody makes money off of this because I don’t wish losing on anybody.

There are some grammatical errors in their descriptions and their CEO, CFO, secretary, and director are all the same person, which I find kinda weird for a company that claims it can produce hundreds of millions of test strips. 

So they got a letter from the FDA. Big deal. That doesn’t mean they have approval, right? It doesn’t even sound like they have a final product yet. Their ‘contacts’ in Korea who would facilitate them getting access to the corona virus to make their product is also a big question mark. Is the Korean government letting random companies take virus samples?

Honestly, is there something I’m missing?

Edit: just saw a similar post in a different thread about this company. Sounds even more shady",2020-04-08

I dont even use a decent amount of my excess investing money on penny stocks. But I love penny stocks, just like people loving going to casinos. That's essentially what it is, except you're kind of counting cards if you know what to look for in the market.
My 3 things I look for in penny stocks before i go any further,
1. Volume : there better be AT LEAST 2.5 million in daily volume the last week. (If it's been consistently HIGHER than normal volume for more than 2 weeks you may be late to the party)
2. A Solid Trend : I normally use 4 hour charts for penny stocks. If there is a solid channel of momentum, that's perfect, if not, it's not a goner, but it definitely isnt a near term play for me.
3. Insider Trading : I ALWAYS look to see if the current management and majority owners are buying more or selling. If they're buying more stock, that means they believe it's a good price and they intend for it to go higher. If there is a lot of insider selling, this is a good indication you're late to the party.

You have to remember that penny stocks are constantly being pumped and dumped, legally for the most part, but still, if you can see it early you can take away a good 10% in a week or so from the trade, if not more, as some of these penny stocks will EXPLODE and those are the reason we keep showing up to the casino!!!",2020-04-08

From a literal perspective, I see what you’re saying...but in reality, the pandemic should cause the stock to climb, not move in the inverse. If you have a testing kit, vaccine, cure, etc. to treat/rid/solve Covid, you shouldn’t see a decline in the stock..it should tick higher. 

For example, Airline stock dips would be a derivative of the pandemic. They’re directly correlated (Pandemic causes flights to cancel and people to fear travel &gt; less earnings + high fixed costs = less profitability &gt; reflects in valuation &gt; in form of share price). That’s a derivative. 

If people are betting that the hype has no substance, and therefore its seeing more sellers than buyers, thats not because of the pandemic. Thats just because people don’t believe in it. There’s a difference. They’re selling because it has an incredibly high beta.",2020-04-08

For instance, Robinhood, the platform a lot of new traders use, allows you from 9-930ET in the AM and from 4-6ET in the PM. 

Trades made during this time period can execute immediately with a limit order if the conditions for the order are met and you've signalled that you've allowed it to execute after hours (on RH it's a small check box near the limit price when you place an order). If they aren't, you can still cancel the order at any time.

The exception to this is OTC stocks, which can only be traded during standard market hours.

Remember, every platform is a bit different on it though, so check yours to see what hours you can trade.

 - Get up early and check ""newsfilter.io"" for press releases. Or any other PR website. Based on the news you can usually get a solid entry and sell into the spike at the open. You get a limit on the # of articles you can read if you're not a member an easy bypass to this is clearing your history/cookies. 

(Take note, be aware of diff brokers opening at diff times if you're trading pre market. Eg. RobinHood opens  half hour before the open so expect a dip/ profit taking from those who held prior to the spike)

- Have a premarket scanner looking for top pct gainers or stocks with high volume and low float. There's always a reason why it's moving. I personally use tradingview for PM.

- CRUCIAL tool for traders, get a Twitter account and follow @acinvestorblog @SuperLuckee they tweet out news alerts the second it comes out. I caught their BIOL alert today. Waited an hour for pull back around .50 area ( whole dollar half dollar, key level)

(If you're long biased, by the time news comes out algo's already beat you to it. So be patient and wait for the profit taking/pullback. )

A limit order will execute at the best available price up to your set limit at the time of its actual completion.

Sometimes it might not go off and fill immediately if you have a large order and there are not enough shares being traded - or, of course, if your limit just isn't met.

People always upload news on there or pending news such as potential dates for presentations, FDA meetings, SEC filings etc. For example today, AYTU showing up on Fox news I would not have known about.

In terms of notifications, I mostly rely on twitter and newsfilter.io and occasionally scan my watchlist on stocktwits. One platform, ""Stockstotrade"", has everything you need. breaking news, float, volume, notifications/alerts all on one interface but I don't use it cause it's $149 a month. I find brokers tend to have late news so I don't rely on my broker for news.

I highly suggest you not trade on your phone. For context, my daily setup is my phone on the table with twitter alerts from acinvestorblog, superluckee, and dekmartrades (dekmars late sometimes). On one monitor I have tabs of newsfilter, Yahoo finance, finviz, barchart, and tradingview (screeners). The other screen is my trading platform. There's a lot of things you have to be able to quickly manage and draw info from which is hard to do on your phone.

The second news comes out or I get an alert on twitter I check the PR on newsfilter tab quick but accurately. Sometimes they include the link to the news in their tweet. You must be able to weed out fluff news from good news. After that i check float and market cap on Yahoo finance. Type the ticker in broker and check the daily chart. Then you find support/resistance levels to either short into or dip buy. NEVER chase news you cant beat algorithms from institutions, be patient with your entries.

Everything I use is free aside from my broker and I'm doing quite well. Subscriptions to certain apps help streamline the process but you can do well without em tbh.",2020-04-08
