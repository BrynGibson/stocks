The fact that hemp companies already have this product, means that at the very worst if they don't win they can sell their product. So it's very likely you can break even your money because this information will come out before the stock disappears.

Or he can leverage it against Canada, China, Russia, or Europe.

There are so many battles going on between socialist unions and corporations across the world, that it appears he's just waiting for someone to make a big mistake so he can capitalize on it.
