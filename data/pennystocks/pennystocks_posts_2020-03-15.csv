I mostly bought large caps like banks and some oil companies after the big drop due to Russia and Saudia.

What would the community say are conservative and some strong fundamentals for the penny stock market that have a good long history on the market and good financials :)

22,$SECI only has 40 trading days left until potentially Billions in damages will be decided in the Utah court verses the many Defendants and also paving the way for a future Federal RICO trial.,fj550y,turbonic1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fj550y/seci_only_has_40_trading_days_left_until/,1,15,"Evidence shows that many Technology and Security companies colluded to whitewash the theft of Sector 10‚Äôs Disruptor Technology that was intended to provide all Fire Departments with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications. The system known as PLX-3D was Patented in 2000 and expanded in 2007.  It was stolen and is now known as PSIM. A trial is scheduled for May 11th 2020 for 5 days in the Utah court system. Shareholders believe that if $SECI wins just 1 Billion in damages that one share of $SECI will be worth $3,275 per share because only 306,000 shares exist because Sector 10 was forced to do 3 reverse stock splits due to rampant price manipulation.  Last official price trade of a block of 100 shares traded for $11.50 but most recent shares bought have traded around the price of $23.00   A few very Interesting things have happened recently such as a level 3 paid basher has shown up at the InvestorsHub SECI message board 2 weeks ago out of nowhere joining 5 other lower level paid bashers that have been working the message board relentlessly for a long time. Also ironically Sector 10 just pulled there two websites Sector10.com and WhiteCollarFacades.com down even though they still own the domain site. The CEO was using a Twitter account to get out press releases and his most recent press release stated to be patient that the trial is imminent and that they could not answer any questions as to how the damages would be shared or how it would effect the stock price due to legal strategies. He also added the #FBI and #UT in the message which shareholders understand implies as plans for a Federal RICO trial to be announced in the future. Many shareholders believe these are very positive signs that a Settlement deal maybe close to being completed with a Non Disclosure Agreement as a part of it which would explain the websites being strategically pulled down. Price manipulation has been occurring for a long period of time and there was a short squeeze in play when this stock ran to $71 a few years ago.  All of the Due Diligence information is available at InvestorsHub.com in the SECI message board.  I am a Firefighter and came across this stock by accident almost 3 years ago when it was the #1 performance gainer on the top 10 Nasdaq list.  It seems to be a true David vs Goliath story as the CEO estimates there are over 200 companies illegally using Sector 10‚Äôs Disruptor technology now in other ways.  The core part of Sector 10‚Äôs technology was a Large Scale Data Analytics Tool that the Defendants stole and used and shared with up to 200 other Technology and Security companies for unknown Billions in profits.  The May 11th trial will determine if this is a true unicorn stock with massive Return On Investment potential.  Best of luck to any getting shares prior to the trial as the CEO Pericles DeAvilla‚Äôs message has always been ‚ÄúBe very careful with your shares‚Äù and ‚ÄúLock the Float‚Äù.   God bless Sector 10 receiving full justice and ridiculous damages for the theft of there Disruptor Technology intended to provide Firefighters with Real Time GPS Tracking and VoIP Communications.",2020-03-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fj550y/seci_only_has_40_trading_days_left_until/

1.I whould like to use dollar cost avareging strategy because it doesn't require much every day.I just put every month some money in the market.Buy at same date very months,the same stocks.But i have seen some people that say that this strategy doesn't work and that you can make profit.Is that true?I just want to do this for a couple of months and when I need the money I can just sell all the stocks and take the make back+the profit.

2.Momentum trading.This is one seems a little bit to hard for me because I don't have that much time every day.Plus this is for me seems a lot riskier.

So what do you guys think I should chose.Please keep in mind that I only want to trade on my phone without drawing lines and without needing a computer.
