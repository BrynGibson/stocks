https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VMNT/news/Vemanti-Group-Announces-Investment-In-TrustPay--A-Blockchain-Focused-Fintech-Company?id=181867&amp;b=y

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Jan. 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vemanti Group, Inc. (OTC PINK:VMNT), a technology-driven holding company, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to take 19.6% interest in TrustPay USA, Inc. (“TrustPay”),  an innovative blockchain-focused FinTech company.

TrustPay is the parent company of TrustPay, JSC, a B2B, B2C, and P2P financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company with operations based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In partnership with 22 leading national banks, the company develops and markets several software and hardware payments products, including mobile apps, digital gateways, cloud-based POS, QR readers, virtual prepaid VISA cards, and NFC/HCE applications. In the last 5 years, it has focused product development efforts on 2 key blockchain-based financial applications: an AI-driven digital banking platform and a cryptocurrency trading exchange, TrustDex (www.trustdex.io).

The investment agreement follows a successful pilot program of TrustDex in early December 2017 managed by TrustPay and the Company, offering consumers based in the countries of South East Asia improved access to online cryptocurrency trading. The pilot program attracted more than 10,000 trades per day within 3 weeks. As part of the deal, the Company and TrustPay agree on a partnership to expand global and US market presence for TrustDex and to bring innovative digital currency-based financial services to underbanked markets around the world. TrustPay is working on an API integration to Coinbase (www.coinbase.com), one of the world’s biggest exchanges, for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum transactions. It’s also looking to launch its Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) offering and deliver its unique AI and machine-learning technology to 500,000-strong network of merchants and users.

""Our goal is to build up assets and valuation. Obviously, we are very pleased to add this FinTech investment to our portfolio. With a target regional market of over 640 million people and 2.6 trillion in GDP to start, we expect TrustDex alone to have tremendous financial achievements this year. And with an experienced blockchain engineering team already on-board, we’ll also be able to help accelerate TrustPay’s product launch roadmap for their digital banking platform,"" stated Tan Tran, CEO of Vemanti Group.

""We’re excited to welcome Vemanti into TrustPay,"" explains Eric Vuong, Chairman and CEO for TrustPay. ""We don’t take on a new investor unless we feel that they also bring a positive impact to our business. Just in a few months of working together, we have come to greatly appreciate the astute approach to business by Vemanti. They are the right investor and partner for the next phase of our growth. The global opportunity within the blockchain-based financial sector broadly has far more potential than we can practically execute ourselves. With Vemanti, we now have the partnership we want and need to scale.""

As part of the agreement, the Company will execute an equity exchange for 19.6% percent interest in TrustPay initially with options to increase its stake later. Once finalized, details of the transaction will be included the Company’s filings.

Innovus Pharma’s Apeaz™ Drug for Arthritis Pain Relief Approved for Commercialization in Canada as a Natural Health Product

Jan 30, 2018
OTC Disclosure &amp; News Service

-

Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Innovus Pharma"" or the “Company”) (OTCQB Venture Market: INNV), an emerging commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that delivers safe, innovative and effective over-the-counter medicine and consumer care products to improve men’s and women's health and respiratory diseases, today announced the approval of its Natural Health Product (“NHP”) License in Canada for its Apeaz™ product. Apeaz™ is a drug in the U.S. for arthritis pain relief. Apeaz™ will either be sold by itself as an NHP in Canada or in the future, potentially sold with the Company’s supplement, ArthriVarx™, a nutritional supplement designed to promote and maximize joint health, when that product is presented to Health Canada for approval.

“Apeaz™ ia an excellent complement to our fast growing portfolio of products available within the Canadian market,” said Innovus CEO Dr. Bassam Damaj. “Apeaz™ is our seventh product on the Canadian market including Zestra®, Zestra Glide® and Uxor™ (EjectDelay™) marketed by Orimed Pharma, UriVarx® through our recently announced partnership with Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Vesele® and Xyralid® through our own marketing and sales efforts in that country. Apeaz™ is one of our core revenue-generating products in the U.S. and we are currently expected to launch the product in Canada by the end of 2018.”

About Apeaz™

Apeaz™ arthritis cream is a fast acting, FDA monograph pain relieving drug and over-the-counter medication cream. Apeaz™ is not only formulated to soothe the pain in joints and muscles like other arthritis and sports creams, but it also contains ingredients such as methyl-sulfonyl methane (MSM) and glucosamine sulfate known to help damaged cartilage for stronger and more pressure resistant joints.1 Apeaz™ is indicated to relieve the following: acute pain, arthritis pain, athletic injuries, muscle soreness, muscle stiffness, muscle and joint pain, simple backache and strains and sprains.

To the Company’s knowledge, Apeaz™ is the only OTC monograph drug published and commercialized to reduce all signs and symptoms of arthritis in the collagen induced mouse model. In addition, our proprietary deep penetration formulation was shown to penetrate the joint tissues where the inflammation and joint damage take place (J Immunol April 1, 2009, 182 (1 Supplement) 50.20). Apeaz™ drug facts in the U.S. are available on DailyMed at https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9f36e226-9e8b-4282-9699-84fc7ac499c4 and in Canada at https://health-products.canada.ca/lnhpd-bdpsnh/index-eng.jsp.

According to Markets &amp; Markets (October 2016 Report Code: MD 4660), the market for the arthritis and other related joint pain is estimated to be at approximately $850 million in 2016 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% during 2017 to 2021.
