If any companies come to mind, please post the ticker and maybe a one to two paragraph (or longer) description of why you like the company. Crossposts from the subreddit would be helpful too.

^(Feel free to DM me as well if you're currently looking at a company and would like help researching it. Teamwork makes the dream work.)

**What I'm kind of looking for**

I'm not a day trader so price action doesn't excite me. What really excites me are tangible assets and projected long-term returns on capital. I'm looking for prospects that have long-term partnerships and recurring revenues already in place. For example, a mining company with appropriate leverage, growth outlets, and an off-take agreement. Something as simple as that would get me going.

Thanks in advance for any input!",2020-02-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eyawbi/whats_your_favorite_longterm_high_potential/
