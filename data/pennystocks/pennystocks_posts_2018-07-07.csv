From 1 Billion to 4 Billion.  O/S still under 200MIL according to this filing...but the A/S increase is head-scratching.  If they want to dilute they could still dilute a TON with the current A/S.  Why the increase?  Really curious to see if anyone has thoughts.",2018-07-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8wqhcc/dirv_increasing_authorized_shares/
4,"I know it's been asked before, but...",8wqb12,SweatyConsideration,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8wqb12/i_know_its_been_asked_before_but/,5,16,"It seemed as though it's been a while, and honestly, I'm mostly looking for people who would be willing to answer more extensive questions regarding the markets. I've only got a small amount invested for now, as I'm still learning. And don't want to blow any savings trying to figure out the more subtle concepts.
I have a couple quick questions I'll ask here, tho.
1) Robin hood and webull both have ZERO commission fees, which is highly interesting to me. But they both have restrictions on pattern day trading. Is there any way to avoid this, with less than 25k to invest? Or is that a regulatory thing? This is unclear to me.
2) is there any places/methods that anyone can recommend to find new investments? I'm on stocktwits, and I've followed a couple people. I also have simplywallst. I guess I'm just unsure on what separates a hard buy from a soft buy, and what should be a reasonable due process checklist.  Can anyone shed light on their methods?",2018-07-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8wqb12/i_know_its_been_asked_before_but/
