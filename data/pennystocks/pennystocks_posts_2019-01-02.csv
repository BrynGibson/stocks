Hi,

I have recently come across altavest and their algo trading systems, in particular, the AVsystems. I was wondering if anyone is familiar with this company and knows if they are legit? I can't seem to find any info online as to the legitimacy of this company.",2019-01-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/abo46i/has_anyone_heard_of_altavest/

4,ATE.V - Antibe Therapeutics Inc. - Your Welcome,abwf3d,silverwhere81,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/abwf3d/atev_antibe_therapeutics_inc_your_welcome/,1,64,"Happy New Year!  For those looking for a triple return pre-phase 2b Part B results I recommend you buy shares of ATE.V before the April 2019 data read out.  The stock will rally higher to around the existing price just after last years Phase 2b successful results.  ATE.V has been discussed in length on the board.  Solid biotech, little debt, best part fully funded for the remainder of Phase 2b.    In short, they basically attached an H2S molecule to common drugs, however the H2S prevents significant GI inflammation and reduces pain further on a lower dose (See Phase 2A results). 

For the longs:

Why you should like it 

1) Since there are only 260M shares available fully diluted. 

2) Fully funded for phase 2b Part B ($5M) - Trial starts on 250 osteoarthritis patients in Jan 2019

3) No debt

4) Phase I WOMAC scores were superior to Napraxen (Aleve). (This was on 25 patients and was not a double blind placebo study, however Dr. Wallace stated it was performed the same as would be done in Phase 2b Part B for WOMAC and results should be the same in the double blind placebo study.

5) FDA Meeting in Summer 2019

6) 3 analysts now tracking have stock at $1.40 to $1.80 on successful Phase 2b Part B. Significant upside. 

7) Only 40M warrants and options remain to fully dilute to 260M shares.

8) 21% Insider ownership, up from 19% recently.

9) Top Management including a board and advisers who have done $Billions in pharma deals

10) Global partnerships already underway. 

11) H2S pipeline covers quite a few drugs in need.  Recall they are improving existing drugs, but by using H2S due to Dr. Wallace's Research.

&amp;#x200B;

Due your DD, lots to read on the company, but even if you didn't want to stick around for the Phase 2b Part B data results, you will easily see this stock rise back up to $0.50/ $0.60 /share pre news.  Up from $0.24 last week to $0.33 today on high volumes.  

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck, its a real company with top management operating out of Yorkville, Toronto, i.e. not some warehouse in Phoenix.

If my instincts are correct I believe people are now loading up and gearing for a possible rush this year on both. Always after tax loss season has ended, same for April stocks will sell off likely around that time for the same reason, to gather gains to pay for taxes. However this run might last into summer like 2014 we shall see üëèü§î

**TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / January 2, 2019 /** Gunpowder Capital Corp., (CSE: GPC), (CSE: GPC.PR.A), (OTCQB: GNPWF), (FRA: YS6N), (""Gunpowder"" or the ""Corporation"") is pleased to announce that it has acquired a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") from Therapeutic Solutions Group TCI Ltd. (""TCI Ltd."") to acquire up to a 100% ownership stake in Koch &amp; Gsell AG of Switzerland (""Koch"").

Koch both manufactures and sells under the Heimat brand, the world's first tobacco-and-hemp cigarette. The Heimat brand cigarettes are currently manufactured in Lake Constance Switzerland. In 2018, Koch generated approximately Three Million Francs (""‚Ç£3,000,000.00"") CHF in operating profit (defined as revenue less production costs and taxes) which is the equivalent to $3,000,000.00 USD based on the US Dollar / Swiss Franc exchange rate as of the date of this press release. Koch had negative EBITDA of approximately Five Hundred Thousand Francs (""‚Ç£500,000.00"") CHF for the same period. All figures are unaudited.

Under the terms of the LOI, TCI Ltd., has paid $US50,000 upon signing and will pay a further $US200,000 on January 25, 2019. Both TCI Ltd., and Gunpowder shall be conducting their due diligence and have agreed to pay further Ten Million, Four Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars (""$10,460,000.00"") USD comprised of cash and stock on or before March 15, 2019 for a 51% interest in Koch. Gunpowder will then have the right to acquire the other 49% by paying Twelve Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars (""$12,250,000.00"") USD comprised of cash and stock during the first 12 months following closing.

This deal is subject to completion of satisfactory due diligence as well as the completion of a capital raise by Gunpowder. Gunpowder has begun discussing the financing with several investment banks however at this time there can be no assurance that Gunpowder will be able to complete a capital raise to fund this transaction. The transaction is also subject to regulatory and Exchange approvals as required.

Under the terms of the assignment agreement between Gunpowder and TCI Ltd., Gunpowder has agreed to issue 2,500,000 Units immediately as consideration for the payment made by TCI Ltd. as well as consideration for their costs and time incurred to date. Gunpowder shall issue a further Seven Million, Five Hundred Thousand Units (""7,500,000"") of Gunpowder to TCI Ltd., as soon as TCI Ltd., makes a deposit of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (""$200,000.00"") USD to Koch. Gunpowder has also agreed to pay a finder's fee of Forty Million Units should the transaction with Koch close. 

Mr. Paul Haber stated: ""We are extremely pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this acquisition as we see huge potential in this market space. We easily envision this product being offered in Canada and in the USA. Currently tobacco-and-hemp or pure hemp cigarette cannot be protected by a patent however Koch has applied for a process patent and is in the process of acquiring patents internationally for the process involved in the mixing of hemp (and other herbs) with tobacco. We see this patent as a value added bonus, as manufactures of hemp cigarettes will need to develop techniques and methods to manufacture product which we can license out to other manufactures.""",2019-01-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/abvmvj/gnpwf_gpc_gunpowder_capital_corp_enters_letter_of/
