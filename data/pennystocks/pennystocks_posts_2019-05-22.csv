So I can only go by the chart 
It had a gap down in April and has just laid flat so if this has no news a keeps some of the volume this could be a nice reversal back up to the the 2.60 resistance. It will come across some resistance along the way. 1.55 looks to be the strongest.

LAS VEGAS, May 22, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE ‚Äì International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCMKTS: ISBG) (‚ÄúISBG‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a top-tier brand incubator in the Global Wine &amp; Spirits and CBD-Infused Products markets, is happy to report that the Company‚Äôs P19 25mg flavored CBD shooters have quickly sold out and the Company has been forced to step up its production schedule to meet unanticipated levels of demand.  


‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt announce, advertise, or publicize this product when we produced our first major batch of the CBD Shooters and made them available for purchase on our primary e-commerce site (buyp19.com) recently, so this robust market response is an encouraging surprise,‚Äù commented ISBG CEO Terry Williams. ‚ÄúGiven the strong demand we saw in response to our other P19 product launches over the past 4 months, we though our initial production level for the Shooters would comfortably meet our consumers initial needs. But we clearly underestimated the level of interest, so we are working with our logistics team and partners to capitalize on the opportunity going forward.‚Äù

Management notes that the Company will continue to follow-through with its planned release of additional product lines over coming months, with the P19 Nano-Infused CBD Tinctures product line slated for launch over the next 60 days.

That product will join the Company‚Äôs highly successful P19 vegan CBD Gummies, P19 CBD Pain Cream, P19 Nano Nectar CBD Drops, and P19 Flavored CBD Shooters. All of the Company‚Äôs CBD products are produced in collaboration with BioPulse Labs (‚ÄúBioPulse‚Äù), the market leader in CBD nano-infusion technology, to provide superior bioavailability.

Mr. Williams continued, ‚ÄúOur ground-level sense of this market at this point is that it may actually surprise the experts on the upside. The analysts have been pointing to 10x, 20x, or even 40x total global market growth for the CBD space over the next 3-4 years. From the perspective of a producer in the space, it‚Äôs like trying to fill a bottomless cup. We are fortunate to have the supply chain infrastructure and resources in place to quickly adjust and ramp up production in response.‚Äù",2019-05-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/brr1dc/isbg_upgrades_expectations_following_outsized/

I started trading some small cheap stocks last summer to just get the feel for the mechanics, trading tools, etc. One of the stocks that I was messing around with was CEI, I bought a small amount (100 shares or so) at around $.21 in August to September, sold them in October and essentially broke even. But now when I go back to look at the historic prices for CEI none of the charts show this trading for less than $1 until Jan 2019. For months it was below a $1, heck below $.50, even the 52 week low shows \~$.000001 and it was almost delisted for being below $1. Now all the charts show it between $5-$11 from July though December.

  
Am I missing something? How could the price (which I find evidence of in forums and my own transaction records) now be shown in the $5-$11 range when it was absolutely below $.30 for months. Is there some kind of correction I am unaware of?",2019-05-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/brpq9b/historic_pricing_of_cei/

Gunpowder Capital Corp., (CSE: GPC), (CSE: GPC.PR.A), (OTCQB: GNPWF), (Frankfurt: YS6N), (""Gunpowder"" or the ""Corporation"") announced today that it has acquired a ready to mine deployable first stage cluster of Cryptocurrency Mining Rigs and that the Corporation has incorporated MethodeVerte Inc., the Corporations fully owned Cryptocurrency Mining subsidiary. Gunpowder plans on developing MethodeVerte Inc., into leading-edge Cryptocurrency Technology Company, that focuses on both the mining of Cryptocurrencies and on the development of next generation Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technologies. The Corporation is planning to rapidly expand MethodeVertes operations as the Corporation is aiming to have second and third stage deployments of additional Cryptocurrency Mining assets in the thousands in place, and in operation by the end of calendar 2019.

Since the week of May 6th Bitcoin has increased in value over $2,000.00 USD. Furthermore, Bitcoin is up a staggering 58% over the last 30 days, and as of the date of this press release, Bitcoin is valued slightly under $8,000.00 USD per Bitcoin. Gunpowder, via its associations and discussions with Cryptocurrency Companies, learned that Bitcoin needs to be valued at approximately $5,500.00 USD to achieve a breakeven point for most Crypto Mining operations. With Bitcoin valued around $8,000.00 USD, there is currently a healthy profitability margin in place.

In connection with the acquisition of the Mining Rigs, Gunpowder issued Eight Million, Eight Hundred and Ninety Eight Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventy-Six (8,898,976) Common Shares at a deemed price of Five Cents ($0.05) CDN per Common Share to acquire the Mining Rigs for MethodeVerte Inc.

Upon the completion of the issuance of the 8,898,976 Common Shares, the Corporation will have 106,950,726 Common Shares issued and outstanding.",2019-05-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/brrdtk/gnpwf_gpc_gunpowder_capital_corp_forms/
