On the flip side. If they start to break support and don’t show any reversal pattern, they likely fall substantially. Some advice I can give is only enter the trade if the pattern you’re looking for is spot on, and as soon as you’re in a good amount of profit it’s time to cash out. Take profits and re enter on dips.

So now if you want to make a profit mid-long term you have to check in on that stock every single day to make sure you don't miss a run, and the one day you don't it runs up to 0.0060 and you MISS it.

Trailing is especially useful if something's on a run and you want to get out within X percent of the next local maximum, while allowing X percent bandwidth for small fluctuations on the way up.  Trailing stops are also useful if you're not going to check for a while. (To adjust exit price).

For me the decision often comes down to stop-limits or stop-markets, especially for small caps.  Stop markets protect better against precipitous falls in low volume stocks because with stop-limits, you may not catch your limit price on the way down, and get stuck holding bags.  But stop limits protect against freak, idiosynchratic drops followed by immediate recoveries in the price, which could trigger a stop-market and screw you.",2018-02-25
