22,Churn,fc3nihv,/r/pennystocks/comments/eg0ewn/short_at_52_week_high/fc3nihv/,1,"Traditionally, you'd borrow shares from someone who has them.  You'd pay them a little money to have use of them for a bit with a promise to return them at a specific later date.  They make a little money now and will get their shares back later.  You immediately sell those shares and take the cash that they are worth today.  Now you hope the share price goes down, so you can buy them later for less.  If they are cheaper for you to buy later, you can return the same number of shares to the person you got them from and the difference between your sell price and repurchase price is your profit or loss.   


Today, most people do it with options where you can buy a PUT or sell a CALL to make money on a stock going down.  


Oncolytics Biotech, Inc is trading at 2.76 right now.    
If I buy a PUT with 2.50 strike, it gives me the right to sell it to the person who sold me the PUT at 2.50.  This option will remain worthless until such a time as the share price drops below 2.50, then I make money because the stock went down.   


If I sell a CALL with 3.00 strike, it gives the person I sold it to the right to buy shares from me for 3.00 each.  In this case I've already been paid and the option will expire worthless to the buyer unless the share price goes above 3.00.  So I make money if the share price stays below 3.00.

Keep in mind, these are very basic examples, lacking detailed specifics, to act on.  If you found this interesting, do a lot more research on short selling and options trading  before you try it.",2019-12-26
23,TheRamsinator,fc3nuka,/r/pennystocks/comments/efzt1w/list_of_good_penny_stocks/fc3nuka/,1,"People typically buy penny stocks because they’re high risk. The thought is that higher risk assets have higher expected payouts to compensate for the risk. Put another way, the odds of you losing everything are higher, but there’s a good chance that you’ll make a killing if the company wins. 

The above said, some “regular” companies do trade at low prices for a number of reasons. If you’re interested in buying one of those, then consider AmBev. It’s currently about $4.70, so it’s technically a penny stock (anything under $5.00), and it’s basically the Anheuser-Busch (Budweiser) of Brazil.

Your risks are FX rates between Brazil and the US, and debt (I’m not sure how much they have on the books), but that’s mostly it. They dominate their markets with iconic brands, and they sell a stable product that has existed for 13,000 years.

Day trading or swing trading penny stocks is technical trading. It’s not investing. You’re looking for small float stocks, usually small cap or micro cap, to take advantage of volume and volatility. 

Yes, that can be “disastrous”, but that’s the risk vs. reward of trading stocks that are moving 100%+ in intraday trading. Most of these stocks, you’re getting in and out in minutes.

Dek and Ross are the realest and most consistent and most transparent and definitely not bs. They both have tons of valuable free content every day too.

Cynical is good, but you’re way over doing it lol. 

Verified by TOS, because it’s live and I’m familiar with their brokers. I know what paper trading and real trading looks like on each broker. 

Only subscription I’ve bought is Deks, after TONS of research, and it was 100% worth it. Idk about option sniper, but I’ve heard of it. But if that “getting caught” is the same bs as your twitter link...then that means absolutely nothing to me. 

Although I’d suggest to anyone to stay far away from options, way too much risk, too complicated, too many ways to lose. I’ve yet to see anyone do much with options long term. I’ve personally seen penny traders do well with my own eyes. 

Ross and Dek have live in person trading at conferences too btw.
