4,"No PDT, margin broker with low fees?",b7fzpl,KomandoMetz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b7fzpl/no_pdt_margin_broker_with_low_fees/,4,13,"Title. I'm looking for a broker that has no PDT and offers margin, 5:1 or more.
Preferably low order fees. Monthly platform/software fees are okish I guess.
Are there brokers out there to offer this kind of stuff?
I've been looking for a while now and can't seem to find any.
I'm not US. I'm from EU.
Would be great if someone could give advice!
