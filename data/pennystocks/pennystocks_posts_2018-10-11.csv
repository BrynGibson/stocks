SANTA MONICA, Calif., Oct. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE, LLC ‚Äì Wanderport Corporation (OTC Markets: [WDRP](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YQTrhEdpHTTTNDxcOeU2Qf67KwL39-87TAaaWuf2T6UpiPIiJF6vmPpCelNovI0wdkl2EVwtHUaA-yjYvt_FD_yE81lUmBRFpba8yD4huEw=)), a premier manufacturer and distributor of food, beverages and consumer products made with hemp, is pleased to announce an update for its alcohol beverage initiatives.  


From a strategic partnership with Elite Beverage International (EBI), the Company introduces a line of alcohol beverages that is immediately available for worldwide distribution.¬† Initial focus will be on a line of award winning Comisario Tequila.¬†

The Comisario Tequila line consists of three flavors, mixable Blanco and aged expressions Reposado and A√±ejo.¬† All flavors have competed and won various awards at the Ultra-Premium Category.¬† The demand and sales for these premium Tequila have been strong with new distributors and accounts secured on a rapid basis.

Elite Beverage currently work with a wide network of distributors including Empire Distributors, a Warren Buffet owned company, Tri-Vin Imports (NY, NJ, CT), Breakthru Bev (currently in 18 states) and many others.¬† Breakthru is in the process of merging with RNDC which will result in a footprint of over 35 states.¬† EBI is also in talks to become a supplier to the third largest US alcohol beverage wholesaler, Youngs Market, who is California based and in 14 markets.¬†

Comisario Tequila has been endorsed by several celebrities.¬† The products are currently available at selected Costco stores, MGM Resorts and over 100 establishments in the US and Mexico.

Interest and demand for premium tequilas have been on rise with major multinationals spending large sum on acquisitions such as Patron - $5.1B, Casamigos - $1B, Herradura - $786M.

Wanderport owns a minority equity stake of Elite Beverage and is working to open new markets for EBI in Asia.¬† The Company is also working with EBI on leveraging its wide network of distributors to sell Hemp Brown Ale and Hemp IPA craft beers from its partner, Sipp Industries (OTC Markets: SIPC).¬† Plans are in the work for all three companies to cross sell each other‚Äôs products in the near future.

The Company also restarted its Coffee Beer initiative with a craft brewery in Southern California to establish its initial local footprint.¬† Wanderport will also collaborate with Sipp Industries to evaluate the feasibility of producing another hemp beer from the California or West Coast region.

All domestic and international distributors who wish to distribute Comisario or craft hemp beers are welcome to contact the Company at info@wanderportcorp.com.

‚ÄúDue to past unclear regulations regarding hemp and CBD, we have temporarily put a few initiatives on hold,‚Äù stated Liliana Vo, Wanderport‚Äôs President and Interim CEO.¬† ‚ÄúWith the pending passing of the Farm Bill, we are refocusing our efforts on hemp CBD related products.¬† We have also been working on other wellness related initiatives to expand our revenue streams and plan to provide additional details in the near future,‚Äù added Vo.

&amp;#x200B;

* **McKinsey &amp; Co. estimates that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will generate up to $2 trillion in additional value in Supply Chain and Manufacturing (1)**
* **Quest intends to integrate AI into its Supply Chain solutions; Acquisition positions Company to penetrate new large verticals including Security, Parking Automation and Access Control**  
 
* **6,300 Installations in North America provide a solid base for high value Big Data and Analytics**

EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quest Solution, Inc.¬†(OTCQB: QUES), (‚ÄúQuest‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) a specialty systems integrator focused on field and supply chain mobility, announced that it has acquired HTS Imaging Processing, Inc. (‚ÄúHTS‚Äù), a technological world leader in computer vision image processing-based solutions for Security, Safe Cities, Traffic Management, Parking Management, Law Enforcement, Surveillance and Access Control.

HTS‚Äô groundbreaking AI-based vision solutions are currently in use for sensitive Homeland Security anti-terror projects and discerning customers including: the Brookhaven National Laboratory for access control, JFK Airport, Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, Boston‚Äôs Logan Airport, the U.S. Department of Transportation for readers at the US/Mexico border crossing, as well as a Florida municipality, and a Middle Eastern Homeland Security authority for the automated monitoring of sensitive zones.

Inspired by time-critical ‚Äúfriend or foe‚Äù decision-making processes, HTS‚Äô patented algorithms are based on a combination of cognitive science and machine learning-based (Artificial Intelligence) pattern recognition arbitrated through a multilayered decision-making process which offers both¬†speed¬†and¬†accuracy.

The Company believes that integrating HTS‚Äô patented and proprietary AI technology into Quest‚Äôs existing Supply Chain offering will allow for automated logistics monitoring and optimization, creating operational efficiencies at the higher margins associated with the AI value-creation paradigm for both Quest and its Fortune 500 clientele. For the first six months of 2018, Quest reported revenues of approximately $29 million.

For fiscal year 2018, HTS is expected to generate approximately $10 million in revenue with operational profitability and average gross margin of approximately 38% -- significantly higher than Quest‚Äôs average gross margin of 21%. Quest is purchasing HTS for $6.3 million, mainly paid in restricted shares at the average closing price for the trailing 20 trading days.

Shai Lustgarten, CEO of Quest Solution, stated, ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to bring innovative AI solutions to our Fortune 500 customers in the Supply Chain market. Adding new technology with Company-owned IP was a key goal that we articulated when new management embarked on the turnaround of Quest. This acquisition provides higher margin growth and transforms Quest‚Äôs business model by positioning the Company as a technological leader with state-of-the-art solutions in two multi-billion dollar, high growth markets:

* HTS‚Äô original Smart City and Homeland Security markets, with applications such as Automated Access Control, Parking and Traffic management
* Quest‚Äôs original Supply Chain Management market with significantly higher margins gained by the integration of HTS‚Äô AI technology

‚ÄúHTS‚Äô AI technology will take our Supply Chain solutions to the next level, addressing essential needs in Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Logistic Yard Management, Automation of Parking, Traffic Management and Security.‚Äù

Additionally, HTS has a Salt Lake City-based facility that manufactures ruggedized computers and other electronics products for a long-term customer base. Quest expects to utilize this facility to support the manufacture of new white label products for its own Supply Chain solutions. The introduction of white label equipment is expected to enhance customer service while driving higher margins and revenue growth for Quest.‚Äù

In addition to his role as CEO of Quest Solution, Shai Lustgarten is also a major shareholder and the CEO of HTS, and as a result, the acquisition constitutes a related party transaction. Mr. Carlos Nissenson, a principal shareholder of Quest, is also a principal shareholder of HTS. A special independent committee of the Board of Directors of Quest was established to consider the proposed transaction, and on their recommendation, the Board ordered an independent valuation analysis and a fairness opinion. The Board determined that the transaction is in the best interests of the Company, that the consideration payable by the Company pursuant to the transaction is fair to the shareholders of Quest, and unanimously approved the transaction (with directors who are conflicted, abstaining).

ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., acted as financial advisor to Quest Solution, Inc.

Mr. Lustgarten concluded, ‚ÄúAs an executive of both companies, I sit in a unique position to see the operational benefits of bringing these two companies together and am pleased that the independent board committee came to the same conclusion after careful consideration. We look forward to this new chapter in the development of our Company and believe this acquisition will enhance our offerings and our leadership position to drive shareholder value.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Oct. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE **-**\- EF Hutton Inc., a subsidiary of HUTN, Inc. (OTC: HUTN) today announced it has licensed intellectual property (‚ÄúIP‚Äù) that provides a means of hedging Bitcoin (‚ÄúBTC‚Äù) to The Bitcoin Hedge Foundation.¬† The license royalty is approximately twelve percent of the hedge value.¬† To illustrate, if the value-added is $200 million, which represents only 1/2% of the value of all Bitcoin, then EF Hutton‚Äôs royalty value would be approximately $24 million. It is not yet possible to determine the royalty because the actual hedge value not yet known however hedges of other instruments, such as a short-interest on NYSE stocks, have a value of nearly zero to forty percent of the float, as of October 8, 2018, according to short interest data published by the Wall Street Journal. ¬†EF Hutton will use any royalty income for working capital, to redeem debt and to fund expansion, including acquisitions.

EF Hutton filed for patent protection earlier this year encompassing this solution.¬† The solution will be introduced by The Foundation in October 2018 and made available to all Bitcoin holders.¬† Bitcoin has a total value of $113.74 billion. 17,312,000 bitcoin are outstanding at a price of $6,570 as of 10:30am on October 9th, according to blockchain.com. down from a high of over $19,357 per Bitcoin.¬† During the market decline in the last 10 months, many BTC holders have desired a hedge that would enable them to mitigate losses and lock-in gains.¬† Consequently, there is substantial pent-up demand for a viable hedge.

EF Hutton developed this solution over many months and has worked with world-renowned economists and mathematicians to refine the intellectual property that underlies this solution.¬† In addition to the EF Hutton team, a series of world-class experts have contributed to this solution including PhDs with expertise in Mathematics and Economics.

The Bitcoin Hedge Foundation is a recently formed non-profit organization whose mission is to make BTC more widely appealing.¬† The ability to mitigate volatility and protect downside exposure is within the Foundation‚Äôs mission.¬† In order to ensure wide-scale benefits from this solution, it will be made available to Bitcoin holders at no charge through select exchanges with an initial air-drop-style approach.¬† The Foundation will soon provide more information about the coin on www.bitcoinhedge.io

The solution will be available to all Bitcoin holders and others and will involve a mining process to mint a coin through a process that requires proof of work.¬† The mining process and reliance upon blockchain technology are consistent with the P2P nature of this market.¬† In order to ensure wide-scale adoption of this solution, it will be made available to Bitcoin holders at no charge through select exchanges with an initial air-drop-style approach.¬†

EF Hutton CEO, Christopher Daniels said, ‚ÄúEF Hutton has always been an innovator and this development is consistent with the history of our brand.¬† It is an undisputed fact that EF Hutton predecessors developed online trading, universal life insurance and the fee-only financial advisor model that is today‚Äôs standard model for delivery of financial advice.¬† We are proud to continue the legacy of Edward F. Hutton with a new innovation that satisfies a significant market need.‚Äù

18,$OGEN On the rise,9nby4d,temsik1587,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nby4d/ogen_on_the_rise/,1,6,"Bought this stock @$2.60 when it was rising (rose 360% in one day). The company got investigated and it kept falling so I invested more, leaving my average @$1.74. It fell all the way to $0.99, around which point the BS investigation was over, finding nothing. It has risen 25% so far today, after falling over 60% the past week or so from its peak.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the end- this stock will continue to rise. Buying anywhere under $1.50, in my unprofessional opinion, is a safe bet for high gains.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 574 shares, which at the start of today was $590, and is now $740. Total loss is still in the hundreds but I have no doubt I'll get it all back.",2018-10-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nby4d/ogen_on_the_rise/
