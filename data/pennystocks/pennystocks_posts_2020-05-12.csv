8,"PSA: Regarding new top picks (KTOV, BIOC, TTNP... etc)",gi7vmn,Awkward-Comma,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gi7vmn/psa_regarding_new_top_picks_ktov_bioc_ttnp_etc/,1,27,"I want to warn you all that Sabby management is in these stocks. 

Why is that important? Well, Sabby is a vulture fund, and when sabby invests in a stock, that stock over 90% of the time tends to fall deep down into the pits of hell and never returns. 
I say over 90%, because there have been instances where stocks explode (like CODX and others). But the vast majority of times the stocks tank. 
For instance Aytu is also owned by Sabby. If you watch Aytu, you will see that no matter what news, no matter if Trump pumps it, it might get a 50% increase BUT every single time it gets dragged back down. 

Dont underestimate Sabby. 
Do DD whether of not Sabby is in a stock, this is the first thing I check on a stock.
If I see Sabby, I just lose interest immediatly.
You can check who holds the stock here: https://fintel.io/
Here you can see who hold KTOV for instance (notice ""Sabby Management"")
https://fintel.io/so/us/ktov

If you are going to invest in stocks that has Sabby in them. I suggest to take profits early, and be extra careful! 

Best of luck to all!

Some quick googling about Sabby:
Sabby bought 3 companies in 2015: https://www.benzinga.com/news/15/01/5134966/sabby-management-buys-3-biotech-stocks
Ticker: NURO down 99.43% since Sabby. 
Ticker: ABIO - down 97.61% since Sabby.
Ticker: OXGN - Did not find anymore, I assume bankrupt.

An article with some info:
https://utopiacap.com/2020/03/25/sabby-management/

tl;dr
Sabby buys stocks and shorts it, they might go up but they almost always crash bigly.",2020-05-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gi7vmn/psa_regarding_new_top_picks_ktov_bioc_ttnp_etc/

This is a stock that has generated some hype because it received the blessing of salm10, whoever the fuck that is, so some have been looking for reasons to invest other than that dude's word.

\-TTNP's top product is Probuphine. It's a once a month buprenorphine drug prescribed to those recovering from opiate addition. FDA approved in May 2016.

\-Given Covid-19, there has been a slowdown when it comes to commerce. Illegal commerce is not immune to this slowdown. With opiate addicts cut off from usual sources, this lockdown has been forcing many to seek alternatives--such as Probuphine replacement therapy.

\-Outside of Covid-19, the opiate epidemic is a major factor in the US. It started with OxyContin, then moved to heroin, and now pharm companies are selling the cure. It's dark, but it's a major potential money maker.

\-Right now, it only has one other competitor. It previously was not covered by insurance. But according to this [United Healthcare Insurance doc](https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/probuphine-buprenorphine.pdf), it is now covered in appropriate scenarios by them, and I assume others have followed/will follow.

\-UHC document was from Oct 2019. Insurance just started covering it recently. Between the Nov '19 earnings report and the 3/30 earnings reports... there was a [22% increase](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTNP/earnings/) in revenue ($.95mm to $1.22mm).

\-There is another earning report coming up on Friday 5/15 with a conference call. I'm guessing revenue could jump even higher with more time. But who knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm not an expert at all. I know jackshit about reading charts. I'm not telling you to buy or giving advice. But people wanted more info on this one so... here ya go.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if now is the time it'll jump. But I know the market and product they're getting into has real money making potential with the opiate epidemic.",2020-05-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gi1yee/ttnp_some_dd/

Then last week it released a positive ER with 42% YoY revenue increase and tested a one-month high. After testing resistance at 0.75 again today it finally broke through late in the day.

The company also announced that in addition to its defense business, some of its tech is now being deployed to hospitals and first responders.

The thing I can’t seem to gauge is the actual/realistic upside potential.  While it’s doubtful they’ll get back to the $30’s anytime soon, I’m trying to figure out how far it could climb back.  The recent spikes upwards of $5 and then back to less than $1 throw off my analysis.  Anyone out there following and/or studying this stock?  What are your projections?  $5? $8? Over $10?

86,Short DD: Consensi drug of $KTOV,gi2gng,benjamin_ngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gi2gng/short_dd_consensi_drug_of_ktov/,3,3,"Information that I use is from:
https://kitovpharma.com/pipeline/consensi/. 

The source that I use is written under the post, and straight to the main point:

1. “ConsensiTM is a fixed-dose combination of celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis, and amlodipine besylate, a drug designed to treat hypertension.” 
-&gt; Consensi can treat patients with osteoarthritis and hypertension

According to cdc.gov, 
(1) osteoarthritis affects over 32.5 million US adults. 
(2) Also, nearly half of adults in the United States (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension.

2. Specially, Consensi is THE ONLY NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) whose labeling indicates a reduction of blood pressure and consequent risk reduction of heart attack, stroke and death.

3. Consensi is under patent protection in the U.S. until 2030.  

-&gt; Check in “Related Patent” in https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-consensi.html, detail of first patent (3) and second patent (4) according drugs.com.

4. Data from Consensi Phase 3 clinical data demonstrated that the study met its primary endpoint of showing that the drug lowers daytime systolic blood pressure by at least 50% of the reduction in blood pressure achieved in patients treated with amlodipine besylate only, with statistical significance of p=0.001 (5) 

(1) https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/osteoarthritis.htm 

(2) https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm

(3) https://patents.google.com/patent/US10350171B2/en

(4) https://patents.google.com/patent/US9662315

(5) https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/31/1515108/0/en/FDA-Approves-Kitov-s-Consensi-for-Treatment-of-Osteoarthritis-Pain-and-Hypertension.html

CONCLUDE: IMO, Consensi can bring a huge revenue to Kitov. 

Kitov said they would release Consensi in this May. If you [check Consensi on goodrx.com](https://m.goodrx.com/consensi), it has been sold on many large retailers and pharmacies (CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Costco,...). I think they’ll will release a PR and advertise for Consensi in mid of May or June.

It can boost the price of $KTOV above $0.651 [(check out this KTOV DD using chart)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_subreddit) in short term.

Good luck to your guys.

In regards to their pipeline you can se from their profile on YF: "" *Its lead product candidate is RP-G28, an orally administered galacto-oligosaccharide that is in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of lactose intolerance*.""

Now where i live lactose intolerance is no issue because of the genome in the north, but i know that around 35-40% of americans suffer from lactose intolerance, so imagine if they actually managed to get a serious contender in that area?

I should NOTE VERY SERIOUSLY that this is not an ""omg buy buy, hype hype"" post but more of a ""this company actually sounds interesting-post""

The paper: ""Country, regional, and global estimates for lactose malabsorption in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis"" [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(17)30154-1/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(17)30154-1/fulltext)

Reviews the lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance on a world basis, and concludes that ""*In conclusion, lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population*""

The RP-G28 is pretty smart cause it does what we've been trying to do in regards to cancer and that is reprogram the cells to either do their job or do it better! Well technically it just stimulates and adapts the micro bacteria

&amp;#x200B;

Also from a pharmaceutical stand point (i am a MS.C in pharmaceutical sciences) the core principal is one of the more well used (the adapt+simulate principal).

Should you dump all your savings into RTTR? Hellllllll NOOOO, why? because even though its in phase 2 its still so uncertain that there will be a significant change or that there will be a sufficient toxocological data (which in many cases requres long term data optained through feedback reporting from patients in the near future = pharmacovigilance).

That being said their Phase 2b/3 Trial did good fairly well (according to them) but ive worked for enough companies to know that you can blast through phase 1 and 2 but still get shot down before the finish lines.

They used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group analysis/trail format which is fairly robust, but the sample size was ""only"" around 300-400, and since this condition is closely related to genetics it would be interesting to se what ethnicity the sample size consisted of.

Is this my way of saying sell sell sell and dump the stock so i can load up!? Nope, i already got my chunk but mostly cause im facinated with their Clinical trials and pipeline drug. I do however have a small amount of RTTR stonks :D

Conclusion

1. Interesting firm!
2. Great idea and great pipeline
3. Good area of focus, large profit if possible
4. Wait with investing until their phase 2b/3 trail is ready for reporting and for peer reviewed data to be presented.
5. Holding prospect if u got stocks = 5-10 years (yes i know its against the usuall pump and dump dogma on this subreddit, but its just my advice).

Note: I'm sorry if this post is bad/hard to read I haven't done something like this before

**What is EMAN:** EMAN (eMagin) is a company that makes OLED displays. According to their website their displays ""perform at low-power levels, extended temperature ranges and provide image performance not possible with LCD technologies "". They offer military grade products, VR products, and products that are meant for commercial use.

**Indicators/Fundamentals:** Market cap of 40.87 million. The RSI is at 88.72 as of today, a sign that it will (hopefully) rise soon, but also quickly crash after that. The company's volume today is at 24 million (as of around 3:40PM Tuesday), much higher than the 835,000 average. Earnings per share is -0.09 dollars. Profit margin is -16%. The force index is really high, meaning that the price is already pumped and might crash soon, however, before this I think it will rise some more (hopefully this will happen tomorrow)

 **Earnings:** The earnings date is on May 14 (Thursday) at 9AM Eastern Time, there's been rumors of a partnership with Intel, probably not true. The expected EPS is -0.02. Other: There's been a post recently on some news saying that eMagin might partner with Intel or some other large company , the news is dated from early 2018. Their estimated sales growth this quarter is -7.40%, but the 2021 estimate is growth of 102.10% according to yahoo

There are now rumors that they will be announcing a partnership with a “tier one consumer electronics company” to support the scaling of VR and AR headsets. https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/63363938/emagin

This is huge. The most forward running rumor at the moment is Intel due to this leaked slideshow which is featured in this tweet: https://mobile.twitter.com/MirandaSleeper/status/1260220137334026240?s=20
But, it could be a company such as Apple who wants to branch out into the VR and AR market. 

I would advise you get in on this early, and secure your profits. Do not overstay your welcome. Thank me later boys.",2020-05-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gih0lh/eman_is_the_next_big_pump_dd_below/

I attached a partial script of the video and added a link to the full video. 

[https://youtu.be/\_2ANzCtKysE](https://youtu.be/_2ANzCtKysE)

Partial Script: Today I wanted to cover MVIS again. On friday the company reported its quarterly results on friday. The reports revealed the company is struggling financially but has been trending up since the Friday report was released. The reason for its rise in price is because MVIS has been considered too big to fail for Microsoft. Rumors are swirling more now than ever that there's a strong change that MVIS and MSFT will be conducting a transaction very soon. In the recent conference call MVIS mentioned the word “acquisition” many times. Over the past few months MVIS has been struggling. MVIS is currently trading for $1.14 per share and has a market cap of 162.51 million. It's taken multiple attempts to increase its financial runway by cutting its workforce by 60%.

351,PCTL continues accelerated expansion with new hospital installations and fluid distributors [Update!],gictls,L0LINAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gictls/pctl_continues_accelerated_expansion_with_new/,1,6,"LITTLE RIVER, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 8, 2020-- 


PCT LTD (OTC Pink: PCTL) is pleased to announce they are continuing their expansion efforts with additional hospital installations and have reached distributor agreements with three new entities.


Two of the new distributors will operate in the western United States (California and Utah primarily) while the third distributor is based in South Carolina, shoring up the company’s existing presence in the state.


“All of our potential distributors undergo a thorough vetting process,” says PCT Corp President Bill Prince. “We are looking to form strategic partnerships that will help us expand our existing presence; or establish a foothold in a new territory that we’ve identified.”


“The businesses we work with are looking to maintain their competitive edge as they establish their own sales and distribution channels,” says Bill Prince, explaining why the company often declines to mention their distributors by name. “There’s a lot of competition out there in the disinfection space. Especially now,” adds Prince. “We have a tremendous amount of confidence in the businesses and people we work with.”


Geographic expansion is only one of the areas the company focuses on when selecting distributors. “We’re also looking to expand industries,” says CEO Gary Grieco, adding that the new distributors operate in diverse industries, including medical supplies and equipment to industrial and commercial services.


The companies will commence fluid sales shortly, with the possibility of at least one distributor expanding to produce their own fluids down the road.


“We couldn’t be happier to welcome some new members into our distributor network,” says Grieco. “Demand for our fluids has been increasing rapidly. Expanding our distribution channels helps us to meet that demand on a large and growing scale.”


The company now has at least 10 distributors and sub-registrants for its EPA-approved solutions, in multiple states as well as internationally. They continue to vet interested applicants in their distribution pipeline and expect to continue to add to their growing network of distributors over the next several months and into the foreseeable future.


The company is also announcing a new hospital installation. Following up on an earlier release from April 14th, installation in a large NYC area hospital is expected to commence early next week through PCT’s primary healthcare distributor ACE Janitorial Services. Two additional installations are scheduled in NYC hospitals over the following weeks.


“We’re excited to be able to move forward with these installations and help these hospitals in their fight against infectious disease,” says PCT Director of Healthcare Darryl Patterson, adding that recent travel restrictions and quarantine protocols in New York State have slowed the company’s installation activities over the last two months.
“Our new rack-mounted systems are well-suited for the current healthcare environment where quicker, less labor-intensive installations are ideal,” says Patterson. “Credit is due to Stuart Emmons, P.E., Executive VP for Engineering and Research &amp; Development and his department, who have worked tirelessly to design and build these new systems.”


The Annihilyzer® rack-mounted system provides the same capabilities of monitoring, tracking and volumes of fluid solutions produced as the flagship cabinet model. However, the rack system fits into confined spaces for greater installation flexibility and allowing even more areas within hospitals to be serviced.


“Cabinet model installations may take up to five hours to complete,” explains Patterson. “With the new rack-mounted system, installations can now be completed in under an hour.”


Additional hospital installations of PCT Corp.’s Annihilyzer® Infection Control Systems are expected to continue throughout the end of the month and into the summer.
“Our fluid sales and distribution activities have helped facilitate growth and business expansion,” explains CEO Gary Grieco. “With our hospital installations now on track as well, we’re full steam ahead on multiple fronts. It’s a very serious, but exciting time for us.”

LAKE FOREST, Ill., May 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akorn, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKRX), a leading specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2020.  


**First Quarter 2020 Results and Recent Developments**

* Net revenue was $205 million, up $39 million, 23% from the prior year quarter
* Net loss was $257 million, compared to $82 million loss in the prior year quarter
* Adjusted EBITDA was $59 million, compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter
* Discussions with lenders regarding the sale process and Chapter 11 filing are on-going
* Received Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) and Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) status for February 2020 inspection of Akorn’s Hettlingen, Switzerland manufacturing facility

**Summary Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2020**

Akorn's reported net revenue was $204.7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2020, representing an increase of $38.8 million, or 23.4%, as compared to net revenue of $165.9 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2019.  The increase in net revenue in the period was primarily due to increases of $23.0 million, $9.0 million, and $6.8 million in discontinued products revenue, organic revenue and new products, respectively.  The $23.0 million increase in discontinued products revenue was primarily driven by an unapproved product that has since been discontinued.  The $9.0 million increase in organic revenue was due to approximately $21.6 million, or 14.2% of favorable price variance primarily due to 2019 price increases on certain exclusive products partially offset by $12.5 million, or 8.2% in volume decline principally due to lower sales of Myorisan®.

Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, was $94.5 million, or 46.2% of net revenue, compared to $53.5 million, or 32.3% of net revenue, in the corresponding prior year quarter.  The increase in the gross profit percentage was principally due to decreased costs associated with FDA compliance related improvement activities, favorable price and product mix, including the sale of an unapproved product that has since been discontinued.

GAAP net (loss) for the first quarter of 2020, was $(256.7) million, or $(2.01) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net (loss) of $(82.2) million, or $(0.65) per diluted share, for the same quarter of 2019.  After a net adjustment of $302 million to net income for non-GAAP items, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020 was $0.36, compared to $0.01 in the same quarter of 2019, after a net adjustment of $84 million to net income for non-GAAP items.  See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $(241.9) million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $(47.7) million for the first quarter of 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure used by management to evaluate the performance of the Akorn business, was $58.6 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $23.4 million for the first quarter of 2019.  See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below.",2020-05-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gibqda/akrx_gap_up_today_strong_earnings_earnings/
