1,A very detailed DD on $ASRT(Assertio Therapeutics),gk5ldx,PradoMV96,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk5ldx/a_very_detailed_dd_on_asrtassertio_therapeutics/,1,85,"**What is Assertio Therapeutics?**
* They are formerly known as Depomed, they have transformed theur company with a current focus on [three FDA-approved products](https://www.assertiotx.com/) in their core areas of neurology, orphan, and specialty medicines as they continue to identify, license, and develop new products that offer enhanced options for patients who may be underserved by existing therapies. 

**Assertio Pipeline Products**
* Currently, Assertio had two products that are past P3 of clinical trails and have been [Submitted to the FDA](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/pipeline/)
 for approval, those products are:
- Diclofenac Potassium: Mild/moderate acute pain 12-17 years
- Long-acting Cosyntropin: Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency

This is very important due to fact that if they are approved, it will provide a huge jump to their stock price/value

**Their patented technology**
* Their [patented technology is known as Acuform. It is a patented polymer-based tech designed to optimize drug delivery.](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/technology/)
* Acuform technology is currently being used in multiple marketed products and being evaluated internally and with other potential partners for many additional compounds.
* With Acuform technology, unique swelling polymers allow tablets to be retained in the stomach—the preferential absorption site for many oral drugs—for 8–10 hours vs the 3 hours seen with immediate-release and some extended-release formulations.
* This gradual, extended release allows for more drug absorption in the upper GI tract, offering the potential for greater efficacy and increased tolerability, with the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing.
* Tablets utilizing Acuform technology can be tailored to deliver new drug combinations of varying properties, either simultaneously or sequentially, for a wide array of product possibilities
* Here is a [link for the actual Acuform patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6723340B2/en) if you're interested in reading it.

**Q1 2020 Financials/reports**
* [The first Quarter of 2020](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)
 proved to be the beginning of what is set to be an amazing year financial and medically for Assertio Therapeutics. 
* Their [EPS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was .10 thus beating set EPS expectations of -.08 by 225%
*Their [revenue for Q1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was $20.92 Million thus beating set revenue expectations of $11.3 Million by 85.16%

**You may wonder how/why their revenue is considered positive despite it being 30M less than the previous quarter. I'll explain why right now**
* The reason for the revenue being considered positive despite it lower than the previous quarter is due to the fact of the sales of two of their drugs to other companies

**Sales of both NUCYNTA &amp;Gralise**
* [Assertio sold NUCYNTA franchise to collegium pharmaceuticals](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981407/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Announces-Sale-of-NUCYNTA-Franchise-to-Collegium-Pharmaceutical-for-375-0-Million.html) for a total of $375 million dollars in addition, they also paid for inventory relating to NUCYNTA
* [They sold Gralise to Alvogen](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/12/1959802/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Announces-Sale-of-Gralise-for-Total-Transaction-Value-of-127-5-Million.html) for a total of $127.5 Million dollars, plus inventory
* Sold both for a combined total of [$502.5 Million dollars](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)

**Why the sale of two high earning products is amazing &amp; what it sets up for Q2-Q4 of 2020**
* With the combined sale of NUCYNTA &amp; Gralise for $502M, Assertio was able to [repay their senior debt in full](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/assertio-therapeutics-announces-closing-of-sale-of-nucynta-franchise-to-collegium-pharmaceutical-for-375-0-millionalso-announces-its-senior-secured-debt-has-been-repaid-in-full/)
* Repaying their Senior debt in full is amazing because with the sale closing and the accelerated repayment of their senior debt obligations, it allows Assertio Therapeutics the ability to invest in their core business which will help them build and grow for the future. 
* [the Company has also retired substantially all of its outstanding Convertible Notes](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results) through $188.0 million of privately negotiated purchase agreements and a tender of an additional $76.7 million.
* The sale of NUCYNTA &amp; Gralise sets up the the merger of Assertio Therapeutics with Zyla 

**The Merger of Zyla into Assertio Therapeutics**
* Early 2020, Assertio Therapeutics [announces the agreement to merge with Zyla](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/16/2001519/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Agrees-to-Merge-with-Zyla-Life-Sciences-to-Create-Synergistic-Portfolio-of-Neurology-and-Non-Opioid-Pain-Products.html) Life Sciences to create a synergestic portfolio of Neurology &amp; non-opiod pain products.

**Why the Merger with positively impact share price/company**
* The merger between the companies Expects to capture significant operating and product portfolio synergies upwards of $40 Million, [accelerating revenue growth and creating shareholder value](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/16/2001519/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Agrees-to-Merge-with-Zyla-Life-Sciences-to-Create-Synergistic-Portfolio-of-Neurology-and-Non-Opioid-Pain-Products.html)
* The combined company will have a leading portfolio of branded non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) commonly used by neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, internists, women’s health providers, podiatrists and pain care specialists
* The new company will have the platform, profitability and financial strength to both grow its existing portfolio and acquire additional complementary assets.
* Assertio said the [combined company has pro forma 2019 net product sales of about $128 million and is expected to have product portfolio synergies of over $40 million.](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/assertio-therapeutics-zyla-life-sciences-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal-57610373)
*  the Assertio board of directors’ expectation that the combined company will have a stronger
financial position than Assertio on a stand-alone basis, with attractive pro forma revenues, 2020 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin expected to be greater than 25% and anticipated 2020 debt to EBITDA leverage of two times
* the Assertio board of directors’ belief that combining Assertio with Zyla would establish the largest portfolio of branded NSAIDs in the United States, significantly enhancing the competitive position of the combined company by providing increased scale and broadercommercial reach, and providing opportunities to expand into new therapeutic areas
* Set to increase shareholder's value

**Final thoughts &amp; comments**
* As I always tell you guys, this is just a very detailed post containing as much useful information I could find and write about so you guys can read and make your own well informed decision. At the end of the day, it is upto you if you decide to purchase shares and how much you'll purchase. What I'm doing for you is that I want to give you guys the best knowledge possible before you make your decision.

* I genuinely believe in their products and I believe in their CEOs and I believe in the merger. 
* The way they are handling and changing courses for this year has been incredibly successful so far &amp; the proof is there with those sales and with beating set expectations of them by wide margins.
* Not only that, but theyre responsible with the new large amounts of cash they've received and the proof is there with them fully paying off their debt
* [Plus the CEOs of Assertio &amp; Zyla who will be running the newly merged company have 25 &amp; 35 years of experience and have previously held high ranking positions](http://investor.assertiotx.com/static-files/81290326-b4a8-4156-872b-6e90487dcbdd) with Bayer, Abbot Laboratories pharmaceutical division, Enzon pharmaceuticals &amp; Horizon Therapeutics

* For those reasons mentioned above, I firmly believe this company will be trading higher than the $1.35 target price.
* I personally own 600 shares of $ASRT
* I'll be holding these shares through Q2-Q4

I've used this place and a few twitter follows to get ideas for stocks.  Pennies seem to have a quick return and I can buy many more shares, I feel like my buying power is better.

What I've learned is news really drives these pennies, then resulting ""pumps"".  I'm not mad at pumpers at all, just myself for getting in too late or reinvesting when the stocks are at a high point.

So I stumbled across StocksToTrade on twitter.  It's expensive AF from my vantage point.  It advertises it mines chatter on stocks and sends alerts to you.  So if you missed Kramer or Fox this a.m. talking about StNE (yeah I did miss it), you missed big gains.  Is anyone familiar with StocksToTrade, see a value in the $100/month fees.  Is there another platform that offers something similar?

For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.
The gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), but there’s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)

DD done by “Informed Observer”

MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK’s intrinsic value.

MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK’s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.

The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.

The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company’s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK’s auditor has not resigned and the Company’s past audits have been qualified with “going concern” risk language, so at this point the auditor’s opinion letter can’t get much worse….unless they refuse to provide an opinion…which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.

As we get closer to MARK’s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28….market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company’s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company’s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization’s credibility.

MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company’s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company’s rare and effective official statement of April 30.

It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK’s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK’s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK’s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).

The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG’s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK’s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkdadh/mark_walmart_disney_other_big_names_are/

99,Digital Turbine $APPS,gjyogg,patdatruth,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjyogg/digital_turbine_apps/,4,17,"Hi all,

I wanted to pass along some due diligence on a stock that I think has been posted on here before, but hasn't gotten a ton of interest, and that's [Digital Turbine](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/). They're a company that essentially works in the background of mobile devices to deliver app downloads to your phone in a more [seamless fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgEWYgjVxxw). 

For example, you go to [wsj.com](https://wsj.com) on your phone and at the bottom of the mobile browser it says ""Download our FREE App on the Apple store"" and you're like I don't want to go through the multiple steps of clicking on this ad, it taking me to the app store, I clicking on download again, it needing me to confirm my account information, etc.

Digital Turbine expedites the process of downloading the app onto your phone with fewer clicks, which results in a higher conversion rate of downloads.

In addition, they have had [consistent financial success](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APPS/financials?p=APPS), growing revenue for the past 4 quarters ($27.2M, $30.6M, $32.8M, $36M), while also growing operating income ($1.9M, $3.0M, $3.1M, $4.1M). As of 12/31/19, they have [no debt](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/quarterly-reports/content/0001628280-20-001236/0001628280-20-001236.pdf), a current ratio of 1.18%, and **posted a net gain of cash of $22.8M** in 2019 with **no debt**, compared to a loss of ($2.5M) in 2018.

They're currently trading at $5.65 and have had a 52 week range of $3.48-$9.12. 1Q20 Earnings will be released on 6/1.

Albeit short, I've never posted a DD before, so all feedback is welcome! I enjoy doing this kind of research, so I may do it more regularly if like even one person is interested.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gjyogg/digital_turbine_apps/

- earning growth 61%
- beta 1.39 ( so you can expect as the market goes up this will too)

- restaurants are going to open soon. Obviously with new regulations but they will open.

142,SELLAS GOT 2 CANCER VACCINES INCOMING,gk948y,JustSomeStonksBoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk948y/sellas_got_2_cancer_vaccines_incoming/,1,17,"Trend reversal and several upcoming catalysts : SLS

&amp;#x200B;

Market cap now &lt;$20M – should be $150M - $250M right now 

SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (SLS) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications with TWO Phase 3 ready cancer vaccines : GPS and NPS. Both have proven to be safe and well-tolerated and achieved very impressive results so far. Impressive list of partners funding the ongoing trials.

&amp;#x200B;

GPS :

&amp;#x200B;

•	In February 2020, SELLAS announced positive follow-up data from its Phase 1/2 study of GPS in CR2 AML patients. The final data show a median overall survival (OS) of 21.0 months, at a median follow-up of 30.8 months, in patients receiving GPS compared to 5.4 months in patients treated with best standard care (p-value &lt; 0.02). GPS therapy continued to be well-tolerated throughout the study. 

•	In February 2020, SELLAS announced the enrollment of the first patient in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of GPS in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (Opdivo®), in patients with MPM.

•	In January 2020, SELLAS announced that it commenced patient screening for its pivotal Phase 3 REGAL study of GPS in patients with AML in CR2.

&amp;#x200B;

NPS :

•	In March 2020, SELLAS announced preliminary antigen-specific immune response data from a Phase 2 randomized investigator-sponsored trial of NPS in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast who are HLA-A2+ or A3+ positive, express HER2 at IHC 1+, 2+, or 3+ levels, and are pre- or post-menopausal. Preliminary data show an 11-fold increase in a CD8 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes immune response in patients who received a single dose of NPS compared to baseline. The final data is being further analyzed by the National Institute of Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the study principal investigator, Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD of the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center, and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.

•	In March 2020, SELLAS announced that final results from the efficacy and safety data analysis of the Phase 2b independent investigator-sponsored clinical trial of the combination of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) +/- NPS targeting HER2 low-expressing breast cancer patient cohorts, including patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), were recently published in the peer reviewed journal, Clinical Cancer Research. With regard to the TNBC patient cohort, the data analysis shows:

\-  Disease-free survival (DFS) landmark rate at 24 months for patients treated with NPS plus trastuzumab (n=53) was 92.6% compared to 70.2% for those treated with trastuzumab alone (n=44), a clinically and statistically significant improvement.

\-  There was a statistically significant reduction of 71.9% (p=0.01) in the frequency of clinically detected recurrences in patients treated with the combination (NPS plus trastuzumab) versus trastuzumab alone.

\-  The combination was generally well-tolerated and there were no clinicopathologic differences between the study groups.

•	In February 2020, SELLAS announced that it had finalized the design and plan for a Phase 3 registration-enabling study of NPS in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with TNBC in the adjuvant setting after standard treatment, following feedback from a Type C review with the FDA. SELLAS is actively pursuing out-licensing opportunities to fund and conduct the future clinical development of NPS.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Sellas got 2 very promising cancer vaccines -&gt; will get FDA approved -&gt; MOON.

Market Cap is 20 Million, shares around $3

Market Cap should be around 150 - 200 Million, SHARES ARE GONNA MOON TO MINIMUM $20

Patience will be rewarded

Last week I was stuck on the down turn of MVIS up until their ER, I took that shit on the chin and walked out with a dirty 20% loss. I knew I was a newbie so I just chalked up my L, learned from it, and moved on.

I did a very different play for IZEA this week. Originally in at .56 early on, market open yesterday sold at .75. Mmmmmmm profit! Saw a dip to .65 on ER day?! All in, back in around 11a. Now what I did here was epic: after reaching a comfortable gain that most people would sell at (~.75 again), I placed a trailing stop order at 5%. This way, if it fell to .71, it would sell, but it’s still profits.. But it did something oh so much better, that baby MOONED! IZEA hit a tiny wall at .90 yesterday around 2:30p and dipped down just 5% and had me sell at .86 since the trailing stop essentially follows the ride up to the top! And even if it didn’t dip 5% and peaked at .94, spiraling out of control as it eventually hit rock bottom again (don’t hold through ER in a time like this, boys and girls), it would’ve sold me off at .90. Hard to be mad at that, and one hell of a use of a day trade I must say.

I am still a rookie, but them is my 2¢. Hopefully I can help a few of you that might have felt the pain of an MVIS, UAVS, or most recently IZEA.

TL;DR: $IZEA to the MOON Monday baby, this ish is DISCOUNTED! 📈",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk8n9d/early_sells_stuck_holding_a_bag/

Due to the fears of the the dilution of shares, this is causing the price to drop a decent amount. Nobody will be able to agree on this. 

One of two things will happen today. Price will continue to drop a little up until meeting and then fall more once results are heard. Or two, price will continue to drop until meeting and then skyrocket back up if shareholders hear positive news. Those who are already in and are long GNUS will add as it continues to go down, those who aren’t in yet, it might be best to avoid to see meeting results.

Cons: this is a quick post so didn’t think deep, but the biggest con is that cartoons are already a big space. It may be tricky for them to make a name for themselves and make it. I’m sure there may be others but as I said, this was a quick post.

Pros: unlike most cartoons, they have partnered with big celebrities liked Jennifer Garner and Arnold Schwarzenegger and have concepts based off of Stan Lee and Warren Buffet. That can be huge. They have to deal with Mattel and will be selling at Walmart, which may expand. They will be streaming shows on Netflix, Amazon prime, Apple, Roku, Sling, Alibaba. Of course they have the Kartoon Channel.

GNUS at close had a $48 million market cap. Hard to say any future viewership, ad revenue, and toy sales are priced into that. So, there is still room to grow.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk85o9/gnus/

FMCI filed a letter of intent stating that they wanted to buy a disruptive food company.  Of course, they didn't identify this company leads to lots of speculation about who the identity of the next Beyond Meat will be.  I decided to do a little research to determine likely candidates. 

Based on the information provided in the letter of intent, I assume that based on the descriptor of disruptive that the company will be producing vegetarian products to replace animal derived products. Additionally, since publicly traded companies could just perform a spin-off, the company being acquired will be privately owned or independent. Finally, since this SPAC is in America, I'm only looking at US based companies.   

After reviewing data from a list of prominent companies in this category here is my ranking for likely targets roughly in order of probability.

Follow Your Heart, privately owned, 50 million in revenue 

Turtle Island Foods (Tofurky) - private company, 47 million in revenue 

Just Inc- 30 million in revenue, privately owned

Before the butcher, privately owned by beef co, acquired June 2019.  Unknown revenue. Might be too small

Impossible foods- too big -90 million revenue

Oatly- no, too big, 88 million revenue

Eden Foods- private company, 29 million in revenue, but not focused on meat/dairy replacement 

Excluded because publicly traded owners:
Lightlife, Boca burger, Morningstar farms, Gardein, Field Roast, Yves veggie cuisine, Sweet Earth Foods, whitewave foods, nayonaise, Daiya foods

Overall, Turtle Island Food and Follow Your Heart seems like the most likely candidates.   While Just is also possible , it really doesn't fit the description of having a broad portfolio of products because it really only sells egg substitute.  Before the Butcher seems a bit small to be a potential target, really only distributing in SoCal  

Tofurky has a variety of meat substitutes up to full holiday roasts primarily composed of Tempeh.  Clearly the less exciting of the two as Tempeh isn't as good of a meat substitute as what Beyond Meat is making.  If this is the company,  I will definitely be selling the hype and closing my positions after announcement. 

On the other hand, Follow Your Heart manufactures vegan dairy substitutes (sour cream, yogurt, cream cheese) as well as vegan mayonnaise.  With this wide variety of products, it forms a niche complimentary to Beyond Meat and has a broad base for potential sales as everyone and their brother wants to try being vegan and load up on this stuff. If this is the company,  I will be holding my positions as there is a good chance this will blow up like BYND

However, given the outrageous current valuation of Beyond Meat, I believe no matter which company it is, the speculation around it will be massive because faux meat/dairy is so fucking hot right now and these warrants will jump once the target company is announced.  It's time to get in early before word gets out and this gets pumped too high like Nikola/VTIQ.  

My position:
3000 FMCIW
Plan to sell after company announcement if company is Turtle Beach Foods, hold through IPO if company is Follow Your Heart

TL;DR 
Likely target is Follow Your Heart or Turtle Island Foods (Tofurky)
Buy FMCIW and wait for the news.  Hold for Follow Your Heart, a possible next BYND, or sell the hype if it turns out to be Turtle Island Foods (a manufacturer of mediocre fake meat).",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkcjlk/fmci_the_next_bnyd_or_faux_chopped_liver/

They have also shipped, and are expanding, their roll in Asia for government, religious, and industry locations - 

""today announced that it began shipping and deploying products from its family of AI thermal solutions, including Thermal Kits, Thermal Pads, and Thermal Helmets, in the United States and Japan.

""We are proud that customers such as casinos, entertainment venues, government agencies, hospitality organizations, industrial operations, law enforcement, and retail establishments have placed their trust in our AI-based thermal products to function as part of the solution for reopening the U.S. economy,"" stated Kai-Shing Tao, CEO of Remark Holdings. ""Our solutions provide touch-free access control and monitoring, as well as accurate temperature measurement and the ability to scan as many as 120 people per minute, a rate that is approximately 10 times faster than manual checks.

Our solutions also filter out non-human heat sources and provide security personnel with real-time alerts with photo identification.""

Basically this is a quality stock to hold, but you should be able to play the constant growth and make money in the dips if you pay attention to the timing of their announcements. Either way, unless you sell in the red, this is as close to sure gains as you can find - especially given COVID19 markets.

Why is this happening? Because KTOV has a good PR department that ensures it is in the news at least once a week. This attracts new investors looking to get in on the next IZEA or MARK. 

KTOV will likely peak between .8-.9 because of their PR Department. Is the company a good company? Some say [yes](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/06/2028385/0/en/Kitov-Announces-10-million-Registered-Direct-Offering.html).

271,$ZEST - Ecoark Holdings - After years of waiting I am feeling more confident than ever about this company.,gkjs3x,sulphertank,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkjs3x/zest_ecoark_holdings_after_years_of_waiting_i_am/,1,17,"My background:
I have never posted here and only am doing so because I’ve been telling myself for a long time that I would promote this stock when the time has come and I believe now is the best time to bring everything I know to the table for those who like a *riskier but good bet.*

 I have been invested in Zest since 2017. Between myself and reach of acquaintances we have just shy of 1 million shares (this is between several people that all own their own shares). So yes I may come off as a “promoter” myself or that I’m just looking to pump this for a short period. Yes my goal here is to make money on my investment but I have obviously been invested in this for a long time and believe it could be a great opportunity.

ZEST:

Zest is traded on the OTCGB market and most people I know use E*TRADE to trade it. Zest has been around for years and patented a technology / device that is placed with fresh produce from the farmer to the grocery store. This device can read information about the produce and maximize the efficiency of the supply chain. It is a product that guarantees a cost savings for major grocers. In addition, Zest has bought out several companies including a recent Oil/Gas company called Banner Midstream. This is important later but for now just think of zest as its original product/tech company but also a holding company. Sources say they did this to support their cash flow as energy typically does. 

In early 2018 Zest entered an agreement with Costco and Walmart. After a short period Walmart cancelled their agreement and launched their own version of this technology and named it Eden Technology. We were baffled when we saw this. As investors, we were thinking WTF?! Did they buy zest or what?! Well shortly after Zest filed a Lawsuit seeking 2 billion from Walmart. We have been following the court filing ever since in which the court trial date was set for June 6, 2020. During this time we saw zest fall from $2.00 to lows of $0.45. 

Throughout the past 2 years we have discussed what a settlement would look like and when it might occur. We have seen several ideas thrown around through court filings that would lead you to believe the case is going well for Zest. I’d say the biggest red flag was our research about the law firms on behalf of zest. They take large, highly probable cases. One player came in later than particular grabbed our attention that we certainly know would take on the real deal. 

Fast forward to the beginning to mid last week/beginning of this week - an 8-K filing was posted that urged Banner Midstream to finalize conversion to Zest shares. Also, warrants that were issued last year to be exercised into shares. Without going into to much detail it could be suggested that Zest wants to owe less shares through their various agreements because the share price is going to go up soon. We have seen the share price go from .60 to 1.5 and settling back around 1.2 during this time. Then, on Wednesday we see on the court filings that the pre-trial was cancelled. Through our research with law friends, it is strongly suggested that this would be because of a settlement. With the pre-trial being scheduled and canceled on May 21st and the trial date on June 6th, we are more confident than ever that a settlement was made.

We have heard several numbers thrown around including some that the settlement could be more than double the original amount (which was $2 Billion). But we don’t really know. What we do know is that if a settlement was made for anything close to the $2 billion that the shares would be worth anywhere between $15 - $75 per share. This is obviously speculative, hopes, and wishes, but it is definitely possible. If anyone is interested in a risky bet that I’ve been waiting for years to play out, now is your opportunity.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkjs3x/zest_ecoark_holdings_after_years_of_waiting_i_am/

And had the impression that the list was the result of one of these automated webcrawlers that generates a page full of false-positive information.

I looked up a few tickers to experiment: Brown Forman and Jones Soda. I know a little bit about these industries and saw that CSIMarket actually had a pretty good grip on who they did business with. Brown-Forman did business with IO Glass and a Kentucky independent corn growers cooperative. Jones Soda did business with a lemon company, which makes sense considering they bought the rights to an Italian drink called Lemoncocco.

So, **the page for REMARK on CSIMarket is very likely accurate.**

I post this now because MARK has experienced a massive dip at the end of Friday as shareholders flocked to stocks with more immediate promise, and despite clear video evidence there seems to still be people doubting that they're in Wynn hotels.

So, now you have a monday buying opportunity.

My sense of this is that Remark is not in the position to talk about who their clients are or make announcements on their behalf, and their clients won't talk about every single person they do business with. In other words we are going to discover who is doing business with Remark as the ""re-opening"" progresses and sightings of it are stumbled upon.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkjoy3/mark_remark_holdings_may_very_well_be_the_real/

I made this tutorial on how to conduct risk and reward analysis on penny stocks. Of course, there is no one way to conduct risk/reward analysis. Unless you do, however, you cannot honestly claim that you are doing DD on a security. Following this model, or at least incorporating it into your DD, can go a long way to ensuring that you mitigate risk and maximize profit. It will reduce surprises and place you in a position to act if the trade turns against you.  [You can find it HERE](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/risk-reward-analysis-on-micro-low-cap.html).",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkj9ld/risk_reward_analysis_on_micro_low_cap_securities/

The only stock I'm holding right now is RTTR, I'm in 50 @ .60. I suppose my questions is: typically what happens to the prices of stocks after the weekend is over? Is there typically a rise in price or are traders typically itching to sell? Would it be a good idea to hold this over the weekend? Prepare a stop order? Help!

It is therefore easy to be the first to know. No need to pay for a service that does this for you. 

[Know Your SEC Forms: An SEC Filing Reference Guide for Traders and Investors (Boring But Essential!)](https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/05/know-your-sec-forms-sec-filing.html?m=1)

Overview: With the wide spread availability of trading applications there came a number of retail traders who dove into trading without knowing the power of reading and understanding company SEC filings. SEC filings can provide critical indicators (""indicators"" not ""guarantees"") as to a companies past and future performance. These documents can be an essential tool in helping an investor gauge whether to buy or sell a security. The purpose of the following entry is to provide a brief introduction to some of the most pertinent SEC Forms. 

Why Read SEC Forms?: An important part of doing your due diligence on a company before you invest is checking out their most recent and historical SEC filings. These filings, if read and assessed properly with other market signals, may be a good indicator of a companies financial strength and institutional and insider confidence. For example, a microcap or smallcap trader will want to assess how long a company can remain financially viable without releasing another offering, or perhaps, assess at what price an investor may exercise a previously issued warrant. A midcap and largecap investor might want to know what institutions and insiders are buying, and to what extent a company is growing revenue. In short, learning to read and analyze SEC Forms (combined with other market conditions) will give you a competitive advantage as a trader. 

EDGAR: There are a number of ways an investor can look up company SEC filings. However if you want to go straight to the horses mouth you go to the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system; otherwise known as ""EDGAR."" I recommend simply typing in the ticker of your choosing into the ""Fast Search"" feature. From there you can find all of a company's SEC filings. If you really wanted to get savvy you can see all of your companies SEC filings as they are instantly filed by using your favorite RSS feed app. That's how right! for your convenience the SEC has an RSS feature for practically anything you want to look for. That way you will be among the first to be alerted when a company you're tracking files with the SEC. And just to think there are websites that charge for this kind of alert feature! Like most alerting software, its just a rip off for something you can otherwise get for free.

2. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod)  
&gt;  
&gt;It concluded that Ampligen has been **""generally well tolerated""**, with a ""low incidence of clinical toxicity"", particularly when compared with the toxicity of the diseases it is used to treat.   
\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;""**No serious safety issues have resulted from the administration of \~75,000 doses** IV (most commonly 400 mg) twice weekly for up to one year periods or greater.

But trouble with the FDA back in the day..

&gt;Hemispherx filed a [New Drug Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Drug_Application) (NDA) with the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)) (FDA) to market and sell rintatolimod for the treatment of CFS,[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-Hemispherx2007NDA-5) but this was **rejected in December 2009**, because the FDA concluded that the two [RCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) ""did not provide credible evidence of efficacy""[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-PBJ2010-02-12-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-thestreet_dec09-7) and ""because of **clinical, statistical, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical, product quality, and facilities inspection deficiencies**.""[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintatolimod#cite_note-fda1-8) 

Yet then yesterday, some good news that shot it to the mooooon  
[https://aimimmuno.irpass.com/AIM-ImmunoTech-Announces-FDA-Authorization-for-First-Human-Ampligen-Trial-in-COVID-19-Patients-with-Cancer-Provides-Corporate-Business-Update-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020](https://aimimmuno.irpass.com/AIM-ImmunoTech-Announces-FDA-Authorization-for-First-Human-Ampligen-Trial-in-COVID-19-Patients-with-Cancer-Provides-Corporate-Business-Update-for-the-First-Quarter-of-2020)

&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration has **authorized the first human trial** assessing the safety and effectiveness of the Company's lead asset, Ampligen (rintatolimod), in combination with interferon alfa-2b, in cancer patients with COVID-19  
\[...\]  
A comparison of important pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) indicated that **both viruses utilized the same ACE2 receptor to bind to and infect human cells.**   
\[...\]  
Ellen Lintal, CFO of AIM ImmunoTech, stated, ""I am pleased to report we have a solid balance sheet with **over $31.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2020.**   
\[...\]  
**Net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 was $3.8 million,** or $0.22 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $2.91 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019.

At this rate, you're looking at 3 year runway?  


Product isn't really meant for COVID-19, they've been doing trials for a lot of other issues. But reopening the SARS studies and jumping straight into human trials with something that was 100% effective in one researcher-generated strain of SARS

Know this is penny sub, but feeling bullish on this.

   
**Why?**

  
Yesterday looking at resistance around 3.45 at the start with firm support at 3, but then as the day went on and people kept shorting, the resistance moved to 3.10 and now 3 but each time it tries going back to the day before's resistance level - yet can't. Hmm... bullish?  


**Trading**

At the technical level, this is a penny stock to day trade on the caterpillar pattern if it keeps that up - good 20 cent scalps each time, but if you're swing trading, think about hanging long - at the fundamental level, this is looking bullish over a week period with results from either Japan or the FDA trial Phase 1 to come out in a few weeks time and shake this up.

**Too early?** Maybe. 

But nice time to get in if you think the fundamentals of the drug will show positive news over the hurdle of having to deal with the strains (heard something like 14 strains of COVID-19 already?)

If it's anything like the animal study, this would go to the mooooooon. But likewise, a risk to drop back to pre-feb levels.

Hope this help some of you make decisions on AIM. Playing with this a bit, the risk/reward ratio seems nice",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk3gax/ampligen_aim_bullish/

321,EVERYTHING IN MODERATION,gk3782,Kyletrammell,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gk3782/everything_in_moderation/,1,3,"I am somewhat new here, as are many of you. As we all have come to notice, penny stocks are EXTREMELY volatile.

You don't just make all your money overnight, and if you do, greed will come back to kick you in the ass. Many of us, including myself, have experienced that. If that weren't the case, Warren Buffet would be putting all of his money into penny stocks like some of us here do. It's an investment... this whole process takes time.

My point is that gains are gains. Maybe sometimes you'll have a 75% return on a trade, sometimes it will be 1%, sometimes it will be a negative return. 

What I have attached are multiple spreadsheets showing how much weekly returns can add up over 3 years **with a $500 starting investment**. From a weekly return of 1% up to 15%.

Again as I said I am somewhat new and I am **learning** with you all. We are in this together, this is just something you should keep in the back of your mind. 

THIS DOES NOT MEAN SELL EVERY STOCK AT A MINIMAL RETURN. Have confidence in what you invest in... if you don't have confidence in your investments then you should probably not be investing in it.

**Something to note**\- I'm not excellent with excel so in the B column you'll notice I did 1.01 representing a 1% gain for that week or 1.02 representing a 2% gain for that week... etc. I also apologize that the numbers are small and hard to read.

I don't post a lot on this since I am new, so feel free to constructively criticize. Thanks and good luck fellas.

In addition XELA will likely follow the pump and dump pattern seen by many others stocks in recent weeks(MVIS, XELA, and others) as it approaches the release of it's quarterly Financials on May 26th. 

I'm estimating the stock will peak around .60 -.70 a share before the financials are released.

As you can see, the price action stopped right on my cypher completion point today. Hell yeah bro. These cypher patterns are four-legged reversal patterns that occur at the end of trends (possibly the end of bearish trend for FET?). That means that my next **target** is a lofty one up at **$0.5976** (80% move in price), with a **stop loss at $0.2328**. Yes I'm entering this trade, unless we see very bearish price action when the market opens. On tradingview, with the 'long position' tool, you can specify your risk % for each trade, and if it hits my stop loss, which I'm honestly expecting due to market conditions, I'll lose 5% of my account. Reward is 13%

When it hit .24, I averaged down with another third. Much better position, until the share price dropped another .02. Since then it’s hovered around .22-23 and hasn’t done much of anything. 

Now I have a choice. I can sell, take the loss, learn the lesson and move on, I can hold until something happens, or I can sell my other positions and pump my entire portfolio into this stock. 

None of them sound appealing. 

From now on, I will not be putting more than 5% of my portfolio into any one trade, no more than 15% into one stock.

First listed as a comment but I felt it post worthy. 



Here’s some DD on them:


DFFN IS developing new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most. The company will be evaluating its lead development compound, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of infection with the novel coronavirus. Current treatment options involve supportive care while the lungs heal, which involves oxygen therapy supplied through a ventilator. 


The current coronavirus epidemic is resulting in severe disease for a small percentage of patients, many of which end up on a ventilator as a result of ARDS. This can lead to a hypoxic environment in the patient signified by a low blood oxygen level and subsequent lack of oxygen in vital organs, thus a treatment that can increase oxygenation should help to alleviate these symptoms.


In a model of acute lung injury that mimics ARDS, TSC was shown to increase arterial PO2 immediately after administration without affecting the lungs. 


In a time where ventilators are short stocked, TSC will be a great ventilator alternative. This is all information I was able to find through research. It’s not a scam like some of these pump and dumps stocks. I believe this company has promise. They’re showing signs that they’ll continue to grow even after the pandemic is over. I was uncertain at first but I’m all in now. 


Thank you for your time! Happy trading folks.",2020-05-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gkfz2o/some_research_i_did_on_dffn/

Considering everyone is at home, chilling, and online gambling, I think earnings will look good.

&gt;  
&gt;SAN DIEGO, May  14, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bionano Genomics, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNGO), a life sciences instrumentation company that develops and markets Saphyr®, a platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection in genome analysis, today announced that the company is relying on the order issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delay the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company plans to file the Form 10-Q and report its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 on June 18, 2020. In addition, due to uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is suspending any guidance, anticipated timelines or other outlooks previously provided for 2020. The company also announced selected preliminary, unaudited, first quarter 2020 financial results and recent key financial and business highlights as summarized below.  
&gt;  
&gt;“While we saw an increasing interest in our data and growth in placements of the Saphyr system in the early part of the year, we and our customers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Erik Holmlin, Ph.D., CEO of Bionano. “What began initially as a disruption in China spread across the globe and forced labs using Saphyr to redirect resources to COVID-19 testing or restrict their employees to working off-site, which meant that most Saphyr users were unable to operate their Saphyr instruments and others were unable to take delivery of new instruments. We are adapting to the new challenges brought on by the pandemic and we are seeing new opportunities at the same time. Our operations are fully functional, we are supplying products to customers who are able to receive and use them and we are receiving samples in-house, which we process as part of our commercial services offering. Our sales team is leveraging a number of technologies to reach customers in new ways, and we are finding highly receptive audiences who are learning more about Bionano and how it transforms cytogenetics workflows and reveals previously undetected genomic variations. We are encouraged by the growing level of interest we see and expect it to carry over into momentum in the second half of 2020 when our markets begin to reopen.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**Preliminary Financial Results**  
&gt;  
&gt;Total revenue of approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.  
&gt;

The above information is not a comprehensive statement of the company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and has not been audited, reviewed or compiled by the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary information, and it should be viewed in the context of all other available information regarding the company’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
