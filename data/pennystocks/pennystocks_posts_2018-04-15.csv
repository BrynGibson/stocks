2,"Early watchlist for Monday: CELZ, ANDI, SSOF, GERN, SRUP, FUSZ, PAOG with updates to come",8ccjdv,dirtywiggles,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ccjdv/early_watchlist_for_monday_celz_andi_ssof_gern/,25,10,"CELZ actually looks like the most legitimate company here. As a medical person this is an area I know well and the area they are targeting is one which could make a ton of money and their research is showing they are effective. They are trying to replace Humira. I think it bounces Monday and apparently are waiting on FDA approval this month which is why it is moving. 

ANDI is always the most interesting to watch of recent. Always at least one dip buy per day making it an interesting option. I add it back to the watchlist because it seems the falling knife has hit the ground and we can pick it up instead of catching it. I honestly see it testing 0.008 this week and think it bounces off 0.0056-60 which will serve as the basement. The other chance is that it free falls back to 0.0046 but I am 70-30 in favor of rising because there is so much hype and they seem desperate to keep it this way with the video and unveiling of the actual phone. 

SSOF I wish I got in over the weekend. Always a great chart just slowly climbing each day with no end in sight... for now. I think it goes down hard someday this week and that is why this is the only one I watch until midday to see what it is doing. 

GERN is one of my favorite listed companies now. Just seems to go up overnight and is not that bad of a company. I can see this running up on Monday for sure just not as much volatility as others if you want a safer, slower pick. 

Now if you want a wild ride SRUP is the way to go. I carefully set alert limits when it magically drops insane amounts in a couple seconds and then goes back up 10 minutes later to where it was. Always a fun one to snipe. 

FUSZ provides tons of dip buys if you are quick with it. It sees some decent volume like 100s of thousands of dollars traded each day. Another mid day play. 

PAOG is a company awaiting news sometime and is another steady climber. Is a biotech and news makes these wild.
