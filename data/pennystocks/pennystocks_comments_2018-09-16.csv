After dosage trials are done the management are confident for a global partnership or potential buyout. That's their strategic exit point, before phase 3. Depending on results and execution from management, I'd say the deal would go swift, presumably under way now (conditionally).",2018-09-16

They are contracting with shipping and logistics companies around the globe. They saved 1 client $.20 a parcel, resulting in $1M savings in only 7 months.

UPS ships 6 billion parcels a year. Now add FedEx, DHL, USPS, etc., and you can start to see the magnitude of value MYSZ can offer. 

The online retail business is plagued by returns due to sizing. The sole benefit to shopping bricks and mortar is the ability to try on clothing. No one enjoys doing so. 

With MYSIZE, you can order clothing online with an extremely high degree of confidence that it will fit the way you want it to fit. This will save hundreds of millions of dollars in uneccessary shipping expenses.

Once one big online retailer is announced, or a UPS contract is announced, this will be a $15/share stock. 

They have cash, no RS risk, and no dilution planned. They filed an S8 two weeks ago indicating that they forsee positive events coming.

Now is the time to invest.
