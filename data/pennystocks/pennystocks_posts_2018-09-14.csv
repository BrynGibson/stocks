NEW YORK, Sept. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Digital Asset Monetary Network, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GJqZ8lAb3RVD_inbhkUwjQnJXekORK4ZuvSaH6CFBXxjfxGTzt2vHcfC3ZQUA-ZayK3ZchL2fjsMwyrSSlVrEBkCgkwh_hLcXtdFIju06d8znNDMTkr6BVYzgvCE_IGo) or “DigitalAMN” ([OTCMKTS: DATI](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6nPy99ZhTEOS0a7vT4z6uzI8iME3J09byxDgG8F6tnFNsBP6tyd27SqzPkxdy_tGwNg-Gt2mSTWQmcwQc7JB2lIDfS6ewNKEc8SAibCTFaA=)), formerly known as Digital Arts Media Network, a specialized tech accelerator leveraging the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI) model, announced today that the Company has launched a website reflecting its new name, along with revised presentations and additional features, to support the development of its ecosystem and service offerings.

DATI recently completed a corporate name change to Digital Asset Monetary Network, Inc. This name represents a more accurate image of who DATI is, especially when it concerns what DATI will do for startups and development stage companies, accelerators – along with angel and early-stage investors, in addition to everyday people seeking an opportunity to invest in high-valued, fast-growth companies, at a time when they are affordable. 

The Company, which recently reported the official name change along with its [return to “Current” status on the OTC Marketplace](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=akEFxVCEQnQ2ycNKn2wNkhg43fwQk6mSUD-v7n8g-RyQfxRiMhhAiysSd5pj_ydXplLz71966KjheGV7nlaD2XrEXW1SDxju-0LRSUbb9AHFk9b7K4U0w3o5MFbGOfZ69RiKSGOyxcQYHwhgmbCL0g4IvIv0xbPbYErbJL3HkQAViS4i_1XRg3bwMYlRpiBqM9rQCf9mLypVy1AaD-IH-jDy7dt2QOKU_nZ-a8xcyqWwI5MhRNJ8ZrUdxk5c_VYIQxBDOHB7ruX27Z94HDinWg==), assured shareholders that a new website and social media links would follow shortly thereafter. While the new website continues to be a work in progress, “This website should ultimately encourage interaction with and between DATI shareholders, our client-companies, our portfolio-companies and those savvy experienced investors whom are supporting the ventures, or leveraging programs within our growth ecosystem,” said Ajene Watson, CEO of Digital Asset Monetary Network (DigitalAMN).

Mr. Watson continued, “We encourage everyone to check out the new website, sign-up, and get involved… I mean really involved. We appreciate and request your participation in reviewing the companies we plan to bring on as clients and/or invest in. We absolutely need your constructive suggestions on the development of our ecosystem as it is being built to support your financial growth. Be it that you might fall under the category of an angel or early-stage investor, a startup or development stage company, or most important, an everyday person looking for their piece of the pie. We welcome your input.”
