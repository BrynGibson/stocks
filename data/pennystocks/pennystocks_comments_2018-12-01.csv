Last time he pulled up his account he had a 90%+ rate of return. EARS is one the stocks he mentioned to me, he only trades three or four others. Mind you, he puts a ton of time in and is pretty much obsessed with trading. ",2018-12-01

The dragon slayer is going to be $NLST, they have proprietary tech that is set to blow up in a very major way, big court case later in the week with decision makers present for the two sides to come to a resolution. The odds are heavily in $NLST favor from what I understand. There is a very high probability this is a possible buy and hold 10x bagger or more. If it runs up in Monday, likely to go all week. There are some very big institutional players holding bags on this stock, if NLST wins to resolve the case, you better bet it is a huge catalyst for those big share holders to buy more and get in at a low price. Please Do your own research because I could have read this on a bathroom wall somewhere.
