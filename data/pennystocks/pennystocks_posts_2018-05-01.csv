LQMT reports earnings on May 8th.,8g580x,OutOfBounds11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8g580x/an_oldie_but_a_goody_lqmt_reports_earnings_on_may/,6,1,"Flush with cash and a new manufacturing facility that is coming online, will there be new contracts?  The common belief is that there will be new RFPs and potentially new customers.  The focus for the company seems to be about penetrating the medical device field and there has been some success.  There are some sales to Tesla and a small production to make guitar struts but the approach in the past was scattershot.  Will the focus work?

The company has been very mum but no one knows if that is because there is nothing to report or if it is because they are staying tight lipped as they have traditionally been.",2018-05-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8g580x/an_oldie_but_a_goody_lqmt_reports_earnings_on_may/

7,"Overnight plays for May 1: BIEL, AXXA, IFXY, UHLN, BRKK",8gaxy9,dirtywiggle,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gaxy9/overnight_plays_for_may_1_biel_axxa_ifxy_uhln_brkk/,0,14,"Did not feel like trading today so I sold my morning positions and called it a day. Running low on day trades for now. Well yesterday I shot 100% on overnight calls. All had some solid 10%+ morning spikes that one could sell into. I got some from UHLN and IFXY but they went way beyond what I imagined for spike. I will take 10%. We have a great day for overnights with some solid options just watch how they close before getting into any of them. 

BIEL was one I have been watching for a couple days to gauge how it runs and I am left sad I was not in it. OTC multiday breakout and seems like a relatively safe play overnight and moves slow enough to not stress people. 

AXXA is just wild and appears capped at 0.35 with a descent coming but who knows with this thing. Volume is still huge and could pick up steam heading into close. Risky boy though. 

IFXY  is a runner picking up steam also but it may be capped out and is less of a sure bet for a morning spike but it is always a watcher because of volatility

UHLN is one of my favorites as always providing dip buys and good overnight plays. I see the case being the same today if you can watch it for a dip. 

BRKK is one of the least predictable ones to me but has overnight upside. Seems to have stalled out so I cannot say with certainty. Everyone can make their own decision on it.
