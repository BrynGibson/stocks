It‚Äôs stressful and the penny stocks are highly volatile. If you get in have a discipline . My discipline is I never chase a stock. Lots of pump and dumped and even with those as long as I get in and out within 3-7 mins and make 20-30% I‚Äôm good to go to the next stock. I never hold a stock over night under 1 to 2 bucks. If a company which could be a shell hits 1 buck most of the time it does down. After the big boys come back from lunch we might get a bounce but I‚Äôm in to the next stock looking at the float, VOLUME, and the spreads between the Ask and bid. 
I have been averaging over this year around 2-300 a day. I don‚Äôt trade everyday. Too hard on me. I do have day trading power with my 25k in there but my goals are clear. Make around $500 a week and I‚Äôm out. The more obviously I put in the bigger the profit or loss and there have been plenty of those for me. 
When you start out simulate the trading with play money and once you start feeling confident then start with baby steps. Yes we have commissions on both end so keep that always in mind and whatever tax bracket ur in the IRS will get a chunk. Take all this into consideration.  Trading as you are doing is certainly not for everyone. If you are trading to pay the bills on penny stocks stop ASAP. Penny stocks are anything from .0001 to 8 bucks. 
Patience and discipline is what it‚Äôs all about!! Yes I‚Äôve seen 2500% jumps in 15 mins. If I don‚Äôt get in prior I loose looking at that stock. Onward. Volume and the float ( how many shares are out for public trading) are the major 2 issues to look at. I love learning about what companies do.. an example: VSTR or SHMP  have wonderful patents. Will I get into them?? Only long term. Always put stop losses or market losses on your sells cause these trades can go right past your ask on your execution and leave you dead in the water.  
Always welcome to email me for no money on this end. Here to help. Let me know and I‚Äôll inbox you my email.

I've been forked between *this is a real R/M with real people behind it and the move is justified* vs. *this is a P&amp;D orchestrated by Bux and his followers but idgaf because I'm in at .0045 so I don't have much to lose*. To decide which of these is the real answer, I've literally been doing DD since the time I made this post. The conclusion? It's both, lol.

My only skepticism about SBES is: 
1. There's a guy on Twitter claiming that $ADSV is the real R/M happening and not SBES as both have gone through the same company to register and both SBES and ADSV have the same address (I don't know how this could've happened and I'm not sure how to 100% confirm through a third party which is the real R/M. I could be misunderstanding the technicals here about how all of this works, but 1 side has to be lying). 

2. Robert Xu, aka the guy wanting to bring RockySaaS to the U.S., doesn't answer questions. He's active on social media, but not sure if this is because of a language barrier.

3. The guy disputing ADSV as the real R/M is getting rocked on Twitter because people believe he's behind a recent fake website telling SBES shareholders they have no intention to R/M. The website has been deleted, but somebody typed in the website's address to WhoIs and the domain and admin name fall under someone named IRENE BLACK. Robert Xu has since denied this by putting together a 5 minute effort, GoDaddy website telling shareholders there *is* a R/M happening. The same guy has linked the website ADSV and while *it seems legit*, the website has an email but no phone number suggesting to me someone doesn't want to answer their phone (idk if this is just bad IR or what).

4. SBES doesn't have an 8k and the last one was dropped last April.

5. People are throwing numbers around on Twitter, Yahoo Finance, ihub about the valuation of SBES, but if you ask them where they're getting this info, they will dodge the question.

For me, the things that need to be confirmed are: 
1. Who is Irene Black?
2. Confirm through a third party, not Robert Xu, not the guy running ADSV, but someone who could provide definitive proof which company is doing the R/M. I don't know how to confirm this honestly until something like an 8k drops.
3. On Monday, I'm calling the University of Illinois to confirm Xu's academic credentials.",2019-12-07

76,tboydoboe,fcsrwzo,/r/pennystocks/comments/e7gdv4/need_advice_on_when_to_sell/fcsrwzo/,1,"A penny you really don‚Äôt need to get  involved with the float. I will say each company will release to the public. If the amount of people allowed to only trade the company / low float is low then once in awhile you‚Äôll watch squeezes upwards. Get out at 15% after commissions and move in .. 
most importantly 1-2 times the normal volume brings it possibly to the bigger traders and it might shoot up BUT watch the increase or decrease of the volume like a hawk. 15-20% is all you should ever go for in profit. You might make 100% but remember these penny‚Äôs drop sometimes faster than  as they go up. 
I keep my eyes on my Ameritrade at the profit % and then get out. Once you have this kind of discipline you‚Äôll make money. Waiting for the big pops is basically gambling and usually you‚Äôll loose.
The greatest of luck.

I use Ameritrade. 7 in 7 out. Don‚Äôt go for big 50-100% gains. These small penny‚Äôs go down as fast as they go up. This kind of disciple will make you money. Swing trading doesn‚Äôt work for me with Pennys
