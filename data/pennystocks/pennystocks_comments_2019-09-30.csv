I don't think I will get rich off of it, but I should have some nice gains. At one point, I could have sold for about an 80% gain, but I wanted to hold out for 100% as I believe it will surpass that. They are selling actual products on [walmart.com](https://walmart.com) and will be expanding their markets. I think it will climb, but when, I do not know.",2019-09-30

These kind of stocks are going to come crashing down at one point or another. My policy is no more than three days in a stock with hype. Most of the time you will find it runs for two days and the third it crashes. Also this was a bad day for everyone . If you’re going to hold my strategy is to wait till I see the bottom on the weekly chart for at least two weeks and buy some more. But I don’t recommend this on penny stocks.
      Ok looking at the chart.01 is the low it needs to hold. If it does there is a good chance it’s at the bottom of the range and will come back up. If it falls much below the support of .01 I don’t see a bottom. But it looks like the company is doing things to keep it above that. So if it stays at this low or falls below it I would expect some hype news.",2019-09-30

Then keep watching if kiosks give results and reenter on dips",2019-09-30
