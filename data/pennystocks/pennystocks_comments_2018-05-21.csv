Brilliant business mind. Connections all over the globe 
They have 5000 jets in US and i think 15k Jets worldwide 
The clientele for JETR is loaded with big Biz executives who prefer to fly private, also long list of celebrities and socialites who are big into privacy, and they are working a few NBA, NFL and MLB teams to transport staff when needed 
The company then has a successful dead leg program at cheap rates to cut costs on return rides etc 
There is also a major connection with Israel and their defense tech ..  so yea. Im all in.
