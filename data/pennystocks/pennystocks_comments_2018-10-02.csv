-They have found the world's largest and third largest gold nuggets. 
-They reported 2300g/t of gold from their initial blast. The highest grade mine is approximately 45g/t. The odds they can continue mining over two kilograms of gold per ton is unlikely. The odds that they found the only significant gold deposit in the area is equally unlikely. 
-The initial blast was reported to be from 10 meters, and they estimate the shear zones to total 8 kilometers. There are four roughly even length zones. 
-They are the first to drill into lunnon basalt. They are proving this theory and the theory which states significant gold deposits will lie along the shear zones as they go.

They also have a nickel mining operation. 

Do your own due diligence, though. Hoping for a news release this week. ",2018-10-02

There's tons of ways to invest and things to invest in. The biggest thing is taking your time to study and learn. From there you'll need to find a strategy that works for you as everyone is different. You'll likely find one particular strategy that resonates with you and produces solid individual results. I, for example, am a small cap day trader most of the time  I generally buy into VWAP bounces or short largely extended stocks.

Risk management and minimizing losses are the 2 most important things as everyone loses at times. It's the nature of the stock market.
