Look at recent example NBRV. They got the best news possible, everything approved by FDA, breakthrough pneumonia drug and it spiked a bit then came back down a lot. They are very steady just above the price it was before the announcement. It'll probably keep going up until the drug starts to make real money, but it's pretty shitty short term.",2019-08-30

2,johnsom3,eylkxsr,/r/pennystocks/comments/cxjtl8/can_you_really_make_money_during_ipo_and_fda_drug/eylkxsr/,1,"Yes you can, but like any stock you have to know why you are buying. 

The problem with catalyst like FDA approvals is they are foghorns to flippers. Everybody has the same idea in that FDA approval means price goes up, and the price goes down if it doesn't gain approval. 

Since everyone is now anticipating a price change, a new group of investors come in who have zero interest in the company or the drug, They just see a chance to make a quick flip. 

Naturally everyone playing this game cant win and those that got to greedy get left holding the bag. Now the stock slowly starts to bleed as the bag holders slowly come to terms that they missed the pump and they gradually cut their losses. 

On the company side you will find that bringing a drug to market is very expensive in terms of production and marketing.  In order to pay for the increase in expenses the bio companies will sell off shares to raise money. Dilution obviously lowers the share price as well but the company doesn't mine because the price will rebound(in theory) when the product hits the market. 
In the case of NBVR, i take the CEO buying 50,000 shares as a sign that he thinks the bottom has formed and he expects the price to go back up. I dont think he would do that if dilution was still occuring.",2019-08-30
