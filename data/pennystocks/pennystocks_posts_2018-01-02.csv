Heres the company profile:  Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (MYHI) is a turnkey, cutting-edge infrastructure provider to licensed cannabis growers, processors and producers in regulated markets. In addition to assisting in the design, permitting, development and operation of scalable infrastructure, MYHI helps licensed operators leverage scientific and technological innovations specifically geared to optimize the cultivation and processing of cannabis. 

Heres the volume to price comparison.  The top one is volume, and the bottom is the price,  Its reflected over a three year span.  We specifically look at price and volume for January of 2017.

See the price when the volume sky rocketed in January?  And then the price now compared to volume right now.  We could be looking at a good pop here boys.  

Good volume, weed stock market is hitting, and following the history of the stock, it should repeat itself this January.  

Happy New Years boys!  Wish you all the best and lots of money!

2,$INSY Short Squeeze opportunity,7niwdu,RElliott10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7niwdu/insy_short_squeeze_opportunity/,12,18,"Edit: I’m not sure if this belongs here so if it doesn’t I’m truly sorry, I just don’t know where else to post. 

DISCLAIMER: Before you read this and take all of what I say as professional advice, let me say this: I’m not a professional. I’m 18 years old and just recently got into penny stocks, but please take a brief minute to read this. 

I’ve recently written a Python script that screens all securities on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX everyday in search of stocks who can be potential candidates for a short squeeze. Recently, the one that I feel really has the greatest chance that appeared on my watchlist is $INSY.

It’s shorts have been experiencing a considerable amount of pain recently and if you take a look at a candlestick graph, you’ll see quite a familiar sight. It’s been on a consistent uptrend in terms of price and volume and has historically seen large jumps in price with this type of setup. 

You can obviously just ignore this post and chalk me up to be someone trying to pump a stock with decent volume, but I would suggest you take a look at it yourself and decide. I believe it’ll see a fair bit of action this week. 

Edit: Since $INSY is up more than 12% today, along with a few other stocks I was watching, I can post these types of updates on a daily basis if you guys like.",2018-01-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7niwdu/insy_short_squeeze_opportunity/

First green day after downtrend,

Over 1 mil volume

May continue into tomorrow 

I'm looking to get in a bit cheaper, hopefully when people take profit right before the bell. Preferably $2.02 and then I'll set a stop at $1.99.
