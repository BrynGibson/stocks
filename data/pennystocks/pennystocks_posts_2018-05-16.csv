0,VNDM on the bid,8juxql,sideout25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8juxql/vndm_on_the_bid/,4,0,I am so accustomed to seeing VNDM on the ask. What would it signal to you if you saw VNDM on the bid? Collecting cheap shares to dilute at a higher price? ,2018-05-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8juxql/vndm_on_the_bid/
1,Why trade penny stocks when you can just trade the indicies?,8jvsf9,edwinthomasr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jvsf9/why_trade_penny_stocks_when_you_can_just_trade/,5,20,"The familiar trope: the plucky nerdy warsior trading guy in front of his bank of monitors: 

""ok, today my stock screener has $FUK and $SUK exhibiting the classic horseshoe-dildo pattern that yield's gainz 51.7 percent of the time. So we're going to buy 30000 dollars worth of these 50 cent stocks and hope they go up!""

My question is, why bother gambling on this cheap garbage when you can:

--buy and sell index ETFs like SPY and QQQ during their natural oscillations and generate money that way.

--buy leveraged ETFs that are *bi-directional* to make money going up or down

--buy calls and puts on these equities.

You've got the movement, the leverage, the potential for gains....and the nice thing about fooling with ETFs is you can hold if your idea doesnt pan out immediately. I dont mind holding an ATM call for SPY if it dips because I know it will be back to and above where I bought it soon if I give myself enough time. I dont have the same faith in $SHAT or $GRBG....

2,Marijuana penny stocks (introduction to MJ industry),8jx9d2,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jx9d2/marijuana_penny_stocks_introduction_to_mj_industry/,38,6,"Next video from my video project is about marijuana penny stocks while it is one of the most searched term related to penny stocks. 

Marijuana industry is already booming and we can see emerging businesses. As well more and more states legalizing recreational marijuana. I see MJ industry as one of the most lucrative niches to trade/invest. I hope you are interested to learn more and find out about:

1. how legalization of MJ helps propel public interest which impacts marijuana stock prices. I will be using Google trends to show you recent biggest spikes in the interest and how it affected MJ penny stock prices;
2. will show you popular infographic from 2014 with MJ penny stock examples;
3. will talk about MJ laws and regulations. How regulations impacted interest in MJ industry. As well will talk about why Canada’s marijuana stock niche will have major fundamental event NEXT MONTH;
4. and as always will talk about risks, while I know how much trading and such opportunities can elevate emotions and what not to do. As well will touch upon difference in investing in marijuana stock and trading/speculating them.

3,Upland Software (UPLD) is a fast growing cloud solutions company that expects to triple EBITDA to $100 million over the next 2 to 3 years taking on a “few hundred million of debt”.,8jx7oa,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jx7oa/upland_software_upld_is_a_fast_growing_cloud/,0,4,"
 Current EV/EBITDA ratio is 25 including $90 million of net debt and $676 of marketcap.  The future EV/EBITDA ratio of 10 looks very cheap (EBITDA of $100mm EV of $1bn) and Debt/EBITDA of just 3 leaves plenty of room for more growth and acquisitions.

4,Sold half my shares of COHO.,8jx4rk,BigNasty817,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jx4rk/sold_half_my_shares_of_coho/,6,6,I think I might be the most terrible trader ever! I bought almost 900k shares three days ago when it was .0006 then sold about half when it hit .0012. I knew I should’ve just kept holding on! I also got taken to the cleaners when ANDI shoot thru the roof(didn’t sell) and then slammed thru the floor. I bought there  around  .0005. Ended up losing about $300 on that one. I need to learn patience. ,2018-05-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jx4rk/sold_half_my_shares_of_coho/

6,Trading brokerage help *Commission Fees*,8jwnzu,Saints420Fan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jwnzu/trading_brokerage_help_commission_fees/,5,13,"Recently been using Vanguard a lot and wound up using up all my discounted trades - so now they are up to 20$ per trade! I love using it as a platform for my big board stocks via my ROTH IRA. Now I think I read that you can transfer your ROTH to another brokerage such as TDA etc etc. I believe you can in entirety or as a portion, as specified prices for each. Has anyone done this before? I enjoy trading pennies on my Roth IRA to avoid paying taxes but commission fees at 20$ are a big deterrent

Any advice? Have had pretty decent success in the pinks playing conservatively and I’d love to continue ",2018-05-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jwnzu/trading_brokerage_help_commission_fees/
