&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if any of you are following the penny stock $LFAP? They are making big moves and have recently hired a few big names into their board of directors including: Billy Bean of MLB operations, Robert Tull of ProcureAM (ETF Genius), Martina Navratilova (Former tennis Superstar), and LZ Granderson- Reporter for ESPN, among other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Life Apps Brands (LFAP) plans to create an LGBTQ Preference Traded Index fund ETF that will target Fortune 500 companies and look for at least 100 of them to join in a sponsorship/partnership, helping boost growth, exposure, and support for the LGBTQ community. Below, i have posted a link to a tweet that a loyal supporter of the LFAP brand created to help new users get accustomed to what they might be interested in investing in. 

[https://twitter.com/sir\_logan\_klien/status/1121837304518201344?s=21](https://twitter.com/sir_logan_klien/status/1121837304518201344?s=21)

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty good stuff. It's my opinion that $LFAP will do big things and this is only the beginning for this company. I'm curious if anyone out there has as much confidence as I do in this company? The sky is the limit, Right?  

&amp;#x200B;

Btw, their stock has surged in recent months, their YTD return is currently sitting at 5,166.67% and there is no end in sight. The OTC market might not ever see one of these stocks ever again. Check it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets have a conversation, anyone have any opinions on this? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, 

Mike",2019-04-26

\- he explains why he's buying or shorting something the moment he passes his order. Often even earlier when he's waiting for a specific pattern, explaining which pattern and why

\- also, he does this, not so people copy his orders, but to understand what made him decide to make this trade

\- when the stock doesn't go the direction he was expecting, he explain why he closes the trade the moment he does, and how to avoid becoming a bag holder

\- he teaches you to take measured risks (i.e. : not enter a trade at a point where you risk 10% to hypothetically gain 2%)

\- he does publish lists of stocks to watch, but not for people to follow his orders, just to understand why these stocks have caught his attention, helping you make your own list

\- he's completely transparent with his trades, so you know when, what and how many shares he buys/shorts the minute he does

\- his videos are a pain to watch/listen to as the guy has a annoying way to talk, but the teachings are good
