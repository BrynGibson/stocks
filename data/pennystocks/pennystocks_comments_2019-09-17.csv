This is maybe catalyzed by a ‘board game renaissance’, many new and popular ones now. Iirc board games are the top category on Kickstarter. I personally really dislike board games ngl, but I do see friends and college kids playing them all the time so I can definitely see it. Do I think Snakes is a retail concept like Starbucks which can make thousands of locations, nah, but honestly I could see there being a couple BGC’s in every major college town, which would be a market potential of at least a few hundred Snakes worldwide. They seem to be doing ~2-3M$ per location annually so there’s upside imo. In terms of demand, I had some of your concerns but look into the early locations Snakes Annex and Snakes College, they’ve been around for about a decade now. Still get hour long lines (with 8$ cover charge / person), often beyond the weekends too, and they’ve inspired literally dozens of successful copycat board game cafe concepts around Toronto. So for me demand isn’t really the issue, it’s more or less been established. 

The other thing is that with FUNN getting involved in actual board game publishing, the cafes are only half the picture. Revenue from board game fulfillment + self publishing is much higher margin than restaurants. I’m hoping KTU sales can boost corporate cafe expansion which has been a bit lagging imo. 

Long - long - term though, I do see some early ingredients for sector-wide integration and synergies, with the cafes acting as regional centers for that. If you imagine a scenario where Snakes has cafes coast to coast, why would an independent publisher on Kickstarter choose to have their game distributed by someone else? Snakes can offer that game to clients via gurus, etc, offering exposure that no one else would...for self-published games, I could imagine the same effect; it basically amounts to a bunch of free market research and marketing to have these cafes supporting the launch of your title. This process has basically happened in Canada, some of the major board game-dedicated distributors filed for bankruptcy because Snakes distribution basically gets all the business there. If (and I’ll grant you it’s a significant if) Snakes can establish a robust cafe presence across the US, I could easily see these synergies emerging in the US too. There’s potential for a market leader with a network of Publishing — Distribution/Fulfillment — Cafe/Bar Venues here imo.",2019-09-17

A [market order](https://external.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp) is the most basic type of trade. It is an order to buy or sell immediately at the current price. Typically, if you are going to buy a stock, then you will pay a price at or near the posted [ask](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp). If you are going to sell a stock, you will receive a price at or near the posted [bid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidprice.asp).

One important thing to remember is that the last-traded price is not necessarily the price at which the market order will be executed. In fast-moving and volatile markets, the price at which you actually execute (or fill) the trade can deviate from the last-traded price. The price will remain the same only when the bid and ask prices are exactly at the last-traded price.""   So it's more like you're agreeing to buy what is currently available.

81,AgnosticStopSign,f0oruh5,/r/pennystocks/comments/d5gzu4/txso_on_close_watch_updates_coming_on_new_oil/f0oruh5/,1,"Learn the indicators specifically, and know that different stocks favor different indicators.

My favorite is Bollinger bands, which is the indicator for standard deviation. I know 70% of the price action should be contained in the bands, so if it hits a top or bottom it must rebound.

Sometimes the price doesn’t exactly top or bottom out, and it’s most likely bouncing off the Moving average. You can draw a line with fairly high success as to where the price will go, setting stop losses as always and knowing your exit price.

I shoot for 30%, in a day. I missed today (woke up late) but the stock i was going to buy, GHSI hit 30%. The stock I bought and sold yesterday, ACRS, made me 60%.

Once you know the indicators you can literally google penny stocks bullish indicator and find the stock you think will be most explosive. 

I am favoring ichimoku lately because it has so much info packed into one indicator - moving averages, a lagging indicator, and predict future price pretty accurately with other indicators.

Also factor in volume, I don’t even want it if it’s under 500k. You need liquidity to get in and out. I rarely go long, because I can make 30% in a day, but it’s only because I’m in an expansion phase. 

I’ll then trade options using ichimoku to future predict swings based on where the price will go on stocks with high volatility.",2019-09-17

I kind of bought it as a joke 

Historically they've been into data analytics and information technology. That doesn't necessarily mean anything good for them.

MoviePass was a disaster financially and moving away from it has to be the company's best bet to even have an inkling of survivability.

I obviously can't predict the next move, and at the current rate, it looks bad. However for $40 I was able to own 22k shares. If the company recovers and it goes back up that's good for me. If it goes down I and finally disappears I lost $40. Oh well. 

I know people that spend a lot of time bashing HMNY on the yahoo money forums, which in my opinion is a waste of time, it's quite literally a meme stock right now. It's a joke of a stock and I don't take it too seriously.",2019-09-17

As to FUNN CEO Roger Mortimer, yeah that is the #1 point of contention about the company I would say. He is inexperienced, he has not handled the audit delay professionally, and he doesn’t seem to understand what it actually takes to accomplish things in business so often comes off as wildly optimistic. With that being said, as you say, Snakes IS the real deal, and you have a number of extremely experienced and respected industry players on board.
