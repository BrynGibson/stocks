Selling late April-July,b5qvxv,Jpaperz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b5qvxv/my_robinhood_penny_list_selling_late_apriljuly/,23,13," I don't have enough cash to buy in 500/1k shares for the ones i am not listing. My list is kinda big because i base alot of my buys by 3 month averages. So i tend to play around but these are my keeps.


DPW - shareholders recieving a nice bump by the end of april due to digital farms acquisition

OGEN - 2/3 of regular 3 month average price. Ive been watching this one since august. It will always bounce back. 

AMRH - without including actual news/press, they have been doing fine without the Google hype the last 3 months. They will be better with them if things pull through.

BPMX - i always buy and sell this one. Just time it correctly. But recently been holding it buying below .10. Phase2 data for BPX-04 is due july
It's supposed to be ""topline""

ADXS -  I dont even have to explain. But if you're new to this one their 3 month trend is beautiful.
Here, explore their drugs https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/company/ADXS#drug-information

NVCN - simply because its at its a penny away from its 52 week low, more companies are becoming interest in as they are expanding their product tiara stated in their earnings call.

(OTCMKTS:IGNG) and its Acquisition of the Sugar Stoned cannabis-infused edibles brand",b5qi6e,lagefut,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b5qi6e/imaging3_further_update_on_grapefruit_boulevard/,16,7,"Burbank, CA, March 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG), (“Imaging3” or the “Company”), a development stage company focused on the introduction of disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, is further updating its prior announcement regarding the execution of a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to be acquired in a reverse acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc. (‘GBI”) a privately held Los Angeles based cannabis company and simultaneously vend its imaging business into a privately held corporation which will be partially owned by post - Acquisition IGNG .

GBI is based in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. GBI holds California licenses to both manufacture and distribute cannabis products and is fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations to operate such business. GBI has its extraction facility located in the Coachillin Industrial Cultivation and Ancillary Canna-Business Park in Desert Hot Springs, located on the extension of North Canyon Rd., approximately 10 miles north of the center of Palm Springs. GBI obtained its California licenses in January of 2018 and commenced distribution of cannabis products in June of 2018. GBI’s goal is to become a seed to sale vertically integrated fully compliant cannabis and CBD product Company.

In November 2018, GBI acquired a well-respected infused edible brand called “Sugar Stoned” which manufactured cannabis infused gummy edibles, cookies and other related products over the last several years, and prior to the legalization of recreational cannabis in California, Sugar Stoned routinely sold its popular cannabis infused edibles to most of the medical cannabis retail dispensaries in Southern California, and, as a result, built a strong brand. After recreational cannabis was legalized in California in 2018, Sugar Stoned was effectively shut-out of the California cannabis market due to lack of requisite California licenses. In mid-2018, Sugar Stoned’s principal made GBI’s management aware of that state of affairs and after negotiations with GBI, on November 19, 2018 signed, an Employment Agreement with Sugar Stoned’s principal by which GBI simultaneously acquired all intellectual property rights to the Sugar Stoned brand through November 19, 2021 with provisions for mutually agreed upon extensions. As a result, GBI will, in effect, relaunch the popular Sugar Stoned brand. GBI anticipates that it will commence selling its refreshed line of Sugar Stoned cannabis infused edibles starting in the second week of April 2019.

GBI’s Chief Executive Officer, Bradley J. Yourist, stated “GBI is honored and excited to relaunch Sugar Stoned back into the legal and compliant cannabis edible market in California. We now understand the nuances of the growing edibles market and due to the experience our team has gained by our detailed examination of the Sugar Stoned edible manufacturing process in connection with the relaunch, we are well positioned to introduce other cannabis infused edible product lines in the near future. We are continuing our efforts to discover and acquire other ‘unlicensed brands’ that had a significant consumer following and brand identification prior to the legalization of recreational cannabis in California and found themselves in a situation similar to that of Sugar Stoned. We believe that GBI’s edible manufacturing division will be one of the key drivers in the Company’s growth and success in the coming years.”

John Hollister, IGNG’s current CEO stated, “The launch of GBI’s edible line is an example of the potential for its vertical integration strategy, as well as an additional significant revenue stream. It confirms that current IGNG management’s decision to enter into the GBI transaction and thereby afford current IGNG shareholders with the best available opportunity to have their IGNG holdings enhanced while, at the same time, limiting their risks, was a proper one. We look forward to expeditiously moving ahead with the GBI reverse acquisition and in connection with that have commenced drafting of a definitive share exchange agreement which we hope to execute by the end of the first week in April.”

According to Arcview Market Research, a Los Angeles based research and high net worth investors group, consumer spending on cannabis-based food and drink reached an estimated $1 billion in 2017 in the United States and Canada, and based on their estimates, the cannabis edibles category could expand to more than $4.1 billion in Canada and the United States by 2022. As such, cannabis-based food and drink presents an early opportunity for investment in a cannabis sub-sector that is brand-focused and growing quickly.

Potential investors in IGNG’s common shares are cautioned that there can be no assurances that the reverse acquisition of IGNG by GBI will ever be closed and that even if it is, there can be no assurance that the Company will thereafter be able to obtain the financing necessary to achieve its articulated goals and further that even if such financing is obtained that it will be sufficient for the Company to achieve its ultimate goals or to even remain in business. There can be no assurances that a line of cannabis infused edibles such as the Sugar Stoned products will ever be successfully marketed to the public.

Anaheim, CA, March 26, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LiveWire Ergogenics, Inc. (OTC: LVVV) announced today that its subsidiary, GHC Ventures, has expanded operations at its cannabis cloning cultivation facility in Coachella, California. Two additional production PODs have been added, giving GHC Ventures additional square feet of valuable growing space. LiveWire Ergogenics is a company focused on the acquisition, licensing and managing of special purpose real estate properties for use as legal and fully self-contained turnkey production and distribution facilities for cannabis-based products and services in California.  


This expansion will help meet the rapidly increasing demand from licensed Southern California cultivators for the Company’s sought-after genetics of proprietary, high-quality and pesticide-free “7X Pure” verified cannabis clones it has grown and is currently delivering. GHC Ventures will fill the new PODs with additional “mother” plants to gain valuable production capacity.

Bill Hodson, CEO of LiveWire Ergogenics, explains, “We installed additional PODs at our satellite nursery earlier than planned, because demand for our genetics from customers in the Coachella Valley and throughout Southern California has exceeded our initial forecasts. This is another important step towards the realization of our goal to become the leading supplier of the highest quality cannabis products and services, as a fully vertically-integrated state-licensed cannabis nursery and distribution operation in California.”

“As announced earlier this year,” Hodson adds, “LiveWire Ergogenics has also been granted a minor use permit for a 25,000 square feet nursery in Paso Robles. The increased capacity in Coachella will produce instant inventory for this state-of-the-art facility, so we will be able to make an immediate impact and supply growers throughout Central California as well.”

**The Livewire Cloning PODs**

Every component used in the LiveWire PODs has been designed by LiveWire’s expert cannabis and technical teams, under the supervision of its Master Horticulturist, Kyle McKay. The fully-controlled and self-contained cultivation environment provided by the cloning PODs has been customized for the advanced and highly specialized “7X Pure” verified cannabis cloning and production process. This process fulfills the most stringent legal and environmental cannabis production standards in the industry, from seed-to-sale.

**About 7X Pure**

The 7X Pure Compliance and Dosage Verification System, which is designed as a parallel service to the seed-to-sale data provided by marijuana tracking software, is an assembled set of verified documents at various levels of the supply chain, from certificate of origin to finished product. The 7X Pure Verification System is designed to provide consumers with confidence that the product meets only the highest quality standards.

20,Trade Breakdown - 25% Gains on $BIOC Today,b5tfm1,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b5tfm1/trade_breakdown_25_gains_on_bioc_today/,4,0,"Wanted to do a quick write up on what I saw in BIOC that made me enter this trade and how I timed my exit on this trade.

# Before

This was my third entry on BIOC in the past month. This stock consistently has large volume spikes and then finds it was back to $1.00 range within a few days. I saw on Monday that the stock was trading between $1.00-$1.01 and decided this was an ideal entry for this trade. Very low risk as I set a stop loss at $0.97. So I was only risking a 3 cent move to the downside for a very large upside.

# Entry

Here is the intraday chart from Monday and where I entered and alerted this trade entry at $1.00. I scooped up 9,000 shares at $1.005. I went with a market order here because I wasn't confident I would fill right at $1.00.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exit

This stock can be tricky to exit because there are a lot of times it sells off pretty hard after these pops but there are also a lot of times where the stock continues to run further. My plan with this one was to wait out the 1 minute chart and sell on the first red 1 minute candle. I did just that and was able to capture 25% profit on this trade and exit with over $2,000 banked on that trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this insight was helpful, feel free to ask any questions!
