HICKSVILLE, NY, Dec.  24, 2018  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE – Based upon a strong product demand, [Canbiola](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dMZSB83ZQub7zikTVLqAdr_crtq9hIg8bW0pwjqWI0n43ijiHyehuPruFI9WthJR7zZdj_8ZqtWBWAAT21JTug==)  (OTCQB: CANB) is on the path toward significant revenue growth. The  Company has made significant investment in development of its nationwide  distribution infrastructure through Its doctor and medical office  network and expects this forward movement to continue.  This trend is  even potentially more impactful with President Trump signing of the 2018  Farm Bill.   The 2018 Farm Bill removed CBD derived hemp from the  Schedule 1 drug list and makes hemp CBD Federally legal for use,  interstate transporting, and export.   Hemp based CBD with under .3% THC  (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) has proven to be medically  beneficial in a regimen of wellness and pain relief programs. 

“We believe we are in the right place at the right time with our  public company offering a variety of CBD products under our proprietary  formulation from the laboratory and production facility in Washington  State,” states [Canbiola’s](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dMZSB83ZQub7zikTVLqAdkL2YOAl8FuQ5Ktr_ohcjExQwQkv3QqJwhDZ57u7c-Je6JsiZd5uZMlywxDZiDSkIw==) CEO,  Marco Alfonsi. “We have previously made several announcements regarding  our growing number of doctors on our Medical Advisory board as well as  our Corporate Advisory Board and with their guidance and some specialty  production equipment in the WA facility, we expect to announce numerous  new product opportunities.”  

According to a new article from Rolling Stone, The CBD market is expected to grow to $22 billion by 2022, see [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/new-study-cbd-market-22-billion-2022-722852/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lFN2KefguUMxaJqiMov-1tEPaIn3EhTQuJktS6xErdbMRS7AIU4L7RWUe5FzFnkzHxi0SWf8_o4oWUioFT9MAux7SB9F-D6tOVF8BFdy1eTPxdFsLtwzjC9zXvf4n3rYMZXmoZ71RYxYcHn1ieHv66bNzm7d41owrxTzj6GC6VSxI7ZhwBRn0pdCUZSPnW2O8YeFZe8gLmxQdXDBXXekL0YrMpilVuVpVMwHd_veu_O8slQaEo0lwoRPMvJ7QdNqVBTtR5TvICYQus-InUOS40MZ4bxprAKsjCTwZfzPL3U=)

From  the Rolling Stone article: “CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found  in cannabis, has had a surge in popularity over the past couple of  years. Unlike THC, the chemical compound that gives weed its signature  effect, CBD has been shown to help with everything from PTSD and anxiety  to MS and epilepsy — without getting you high.”

Mr. Alfonsi concludes, “2019 is positioned to be a banner year for [Canbiola](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dMZSB83ZQub7zikTVLqAdmMXTVkqFeo9u0NeQL5u_7v-04jRzGM865oJYb_x5ueeXS9J4w70HjFR5LVHkfLn-A==) as  we have many new efforts underway and believe these efforts and  investments will bear fruit. Canbiola’s entire product offering is 100%  Federally legal.”

**The Canbiola  family wishes everyone a happy holiday and a healthy and safe New Year.** ",2018-12-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a95kqt/canb_expects_strong_revenue_growth_from_q3_to_q4/
