If you do, then do some analysis on the company and market and make an educated decision on whether to sell or if it's not stressing you out and you're already down that much on the trade then just hold it and invest other money that you have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Always do your research before investing. Good luck ",2018-11-08

The answer is always going to be sell and re-invest if you don't like the stock currently. 

People say you don't lose until you sell but I find that to be nonsense. You lose by leaving your money stagnant in a crap stock. If that money could be working for you elsewhere, move it. Every week I clear out stocks that have lost favor with me and re-invest regardless of if they are up or down or by how muck. It's immaterial to the future. Dead money does nothing for you.",2018-11-08
