Dear SRMX shareholders,

CES 2019 was a great show for us! It took almost 6 months to prepare, 14 different vendors and partners, and a lot of hard work to put this show together – but we made a huge impression and gained an overwhelming amount of interest!

We were the **only** exhibitor showing the live voice demo throughout our concept house! Also, we were the **only** live NB IoT demo at the entire CES!

In order to live demo NB IoT, our booth needed live telecom NB IoT network to support the demo. I want to thank our telecom partner for providing this great support. Live demo NB IoT is not as simple as just doing a Wi-Fi demo. Ericsson came over to our booth and recorded a video the whole thing - they were the backend telecom operator and they knew that Tri Cascade was presenting the live NB IoT demo at the show.

We received almost 250 leads from the show - people from around the world with different industries were interested in seeing our smart city /smart apartment concept first hand. We even had representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense and some major utility companies view our demo! One thing for sure - every industry is looking for a smart solution of their management or services with IoT direction. We are changing the way of our lifestyle and how we are going to do with our business from government to private company. This is an evolution of life, and I expect to see it from 2020.

At the show, we also demonstrated how we can use A.I. facial recognition for home security and business/hotel management. No more key entry! This concept received a lot of attention at the show. In order to operate a smart solution A.I. implementation will be a must feature - and we have a great partner with us in this direction.

I want to extend a very warm “thank you” to all of our shareholders for their support and trust. Let’scontinue build the Company together to greater success and continue to add value!!

Sincerely,
