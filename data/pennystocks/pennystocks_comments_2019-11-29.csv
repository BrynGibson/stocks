Seriously tho, i never heard of this co, just looked it up. After hitting all time lows at 3c recently shares have rebounded nicely. 

Balance sheet doesn’t look horrible but only have like million in cash. 

Like u mention the co had some good sales news recently. This stock is clearly speculative but i dont think bankruptcy is ur biggest worry. 

I would say hold unless it trades below 7c which is the price the shares spiked from a couple weeks ago. 

If it moves up above 11c again it could easily spike again.

I never bought any, so I have no skin in the game. The reason I believe the stock will remain depressed:

1. investor faith in a company = people who hold their shares. If a company is under investigation for fraud then less faith. This can be in the courts for 6-24 months. 
2. There are laws against forward looking statements and false represention of commodies, so it sounds like they have a case. I don't know if the defendant will win, but they have a case. It will at least take 6-24 months for the case to be resolved. 
3. Take what is happening with sprint, they are also facing courts and most analysts are feeling quite negative about sprint's future.",2019-11-29

I see these ambulance chasers go after stocks that fell hard quite a bit, rarely do they ever have a legitimate case. ACB was relying on the Canadian government to roll out legalization smoothly, which they failed at. The common consensus was that legalization would be a huge upside for Canna companies and it wasn’t only ACB that was saying this. Them issuing forward looking statements about their future because of the government announcing legalization is not going to hold any water in court. Investors know it’s not ACB’s fault and so do the people suing them. It’s literally just previous shareholders who are upset that they lost money and are turning to these sleaze-bag lawyers who promised them they can get their money back. This happens all the time, it’s not gonna have any major impact on the company.",2019-11-29

I understand their position in Michigan may drive Q2 and Q3 growth, and Ireland for CBD oil. But I understood most CBD suppliers have already cancelled or modified their production contracts with CBD oil distilleries. Plus, because of their depressed price, they will probably have to issue more shares to raise the revenue to meet demand as they are over-extended. If they overcome this issues then they might succeed. There does seem to be a possible upside from 2.44 for 2.54 this or next week. Which is a 4% upside. How long are you planning on holding it? And what price are you hoping to reach?",2019-11-29

But who knows, they could kill it and make a come back. I held a ton of Jul leap calls for a while, but got out of them. I think they have til the summer to raise price or be de-listed.
