In the past it runs up when it has a week or two of high volume. I’m in for 250 000 shares at and average of 0.05. I previously has 200 000 shares @0.12 and sold @0.28.,2019-12-29

10,TheRamsinator,fcie35h,/r/pennystocks/comments/ehbejq/reading_the_market_question/fcie35h/,1,"Most day traders lose money, and they don’t realize it. 

If you believe in a random walk, which the overwhelming majority of academics do, then any DD that appears on this forum is almost certainly a waste of time, especially the chart “analysis.” That statement holds true for most day traders outside this forum as well. 

Instead, any “wins” are the result of a mixture of random chance, crazy risk-taking, and returns from risky asset classes. Traders will likely see their portfolio grow over time, because penny stocks are notoriously risky and therefore have a high return. As such, constantly trading stocks chosen at random will yield a positive return. However, steadily recognizing bid-ask spreads and taxes on good years will cause the portfolio to grow at a slower rate than buying and holding. The constant “everything or nothing” mentality will also cause the trader to experience far greater volatility than they would need to if they diversified. (Properly diversified portfolios have superior risk-adjusted returns, so their owners can take riskier, more profitable individual positions without endangering their overall investment.)

IMHO, you’re best off looking at your investments as a portfolio instead of trying to beat the market with a gimmick. 

For anyone interested, imagine an expected return of 10% per year. Then imagine an average bid-ask spread of 0.001%. Assume 50 weeks in a year, a buy and a sell a day for 5 trading days in a week. That a bid-ask spread would yield a haircut of 0.002% a day, which translates to 0.01% a week, and 0.5% a year. That 0.5% of haircut nets against your 10% gains, decreasing them by 5% to 9.5% (10%*-5%=-0.5%; 10%-0.5%=9.5%).

Now recognize short term capital gains taxes against your 9.5%, and you’re still in the black, thinking that you’re winning. But compare that number to just buying every day 9.75% return and a long term capital gains recognition, and the difference is the loss that most day traders don’t know they’re losing. The above is doubly true if you account for the benefit of paying the tax in the future vs now.

TL:DR - Save yourself the time and effort of financial voodoo, and throw darts at a dart board if you really want to try to guess which stocks are going to jump/fall. It’s a lot easier, just as accurate, and way more fun.",2019-12-29
