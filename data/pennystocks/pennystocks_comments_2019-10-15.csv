34,supernova2020,f3uduj1,/r/pennystocks/comments/di7n34/kulr_technology_adds_to_suite_of_battery_safety/f3uduj1/,1,"In my opinion the lack of present day volume is due to the following reasons:
1) KULR is an OTC company, so the potential investor pool is relatively small
2) KULR is not a bad actor in an OTC space that has many bad actors. Unlike some OTC companies KULR hasn't resorted to ""promoting"" the stock or creating artificial volume .  
3) Although I personally don't believe so, one could argue that KULR's valuation is too high relative to current revenue.  KULR has real potential to disrupt the electronics and battery thermal management game and experience a rapid growth phase as it converts its development partnerships into recurring paying customers. 

Hang in there. I believe that volume will increase over time. Since announcing their Q2 earnings (the Company reported it believed this would be a ""breakout year"" as it converts ""select developmental partnerships into volume paying customers""), there has been an uptick in volume - in the 40 trading days post announcement 31,530 shares traded vs. only 11,988 shares traded in the preceding 100 trading days. The Company has also since made press releases about tier-1 or world-class developmental partnerships. This quarter, we shall see if the Company delivers on its statements by showing progress towards commercializing its cooling technologies in a meaningful way. Stay tuned.

This is my one-sided opinion and you should always perform your own complete due diligence before making any investment decision.

Taking away clean needle access isn’t going to stop *any* addict from using intravenous drugs. It will just force them to use and share dirty needles.     

Not all addicts are homeless, jobless junkies.  Many are regular members of society. Medical professionals, Food service workers, teachers...our husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, brothers and sisters.   

When a user is forced to use a tainted needle, it isn’t an isolated risk. When diseases like hepatitis or HIV  get passed around a community, it doesn’t just effect drug users. Real, actual epidemics get started when clean supplies aren’t available.  I know how counter-intuitive it sounds, but it’s a simple way to keep disease from running rampant while we figure out ways to treat addiction.",2019-10-15

I bought OCGN at $1.54 right after the market opened today and the low of the day was $1.53 today. I had my bid in place before the market ever even opened. I wanted $1.54 because the previous close was $1.53 and it got up to $1.80 something yesterday during a/h.   But, I sold in the $1.60s. I’m busy traveling for a family emergency and I just treated it like a quick scalp. I was a little irritated to see it got up in the $2.70s but that’s how it goes. Like I said yesterday, I leave money on the table all the time, just usually not quite so much 😅.  I ended up trading it again right before the close. I bought some $2.02s and sold $2.14 a/h. Tough to say what’ll happen tomorrow. And since I’m traveling I can’t do a thorough analysis tonight for myself. So quick scalps tomorrow if I can. 🤷🏼‍♂️.  Good luck out there",2019-10-15
