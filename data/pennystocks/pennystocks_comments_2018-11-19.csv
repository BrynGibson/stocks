Personally, I think SK Hynix has more to gain to settle then partner for distribution. That mitigates their settlement amount. Up until now, theres been no indication that the case won't end in a positive light for NLST. They said on their CC that most of their time has been invested in R&amp;D and winning this case. I forsee a settlement but a judgement obviously would be positive as well. I currently have a small position, about 500 shares, but everything provided by the courts has shown this should end well for NLST. Right now, if the settlement is close to the last one SK Hynix paid out to Rambus (I think thats their name?), NLST should trade at $4 a share or more. ",2018-11-19

30,Kenny_Soulstring,eagxbtn,/r/pennystocks/comments/9yhjvw/aytu_at_these_levels_is_a_gift_20m_in_the_bank/eagxbtn/,1,"I definitely think that growing pains took its toll. Aytu buys products that show best in class potential. If you look at their three main drugs, Natesto, Zolpimist, and Tuzistra, each has unique and potentially best-in-class properties that can take a significant market share if marketed properly. Natesto is the only non-black box TRT on the market and recent study results show it has even more potential in keeping men fertile while at the same time normalizing T levels. The same things are true with Zolpimist and Tuzistra. They capitalize on being better alternatives.

Its an incredibly expensive sector to play in. I think that warrants, prior splits, and short sellers have pounded this stock unmercifully into the ground. But, at some point, the fundamentals and execution will win the battle. With $20 million in the bank, I thought the short sellers would have run away. But, at the same time, they know how to cover and professionals push it down at the same time as they cover especially with a stock like AYTU where they can control the volume.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm long the stock and think that now is the opp to take a position. I do, however, am a bit apprehensive in the short term for the health of the overall market. But, for stocks like Aytu, which appear to be at the low end of any realistic range, the risk reward is excellent for my tolerance.

I am also long and very positive on CSBR, BHVN, PTGEF (my #1 stock), and PSTI.  ",2018-11-19
