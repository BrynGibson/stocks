2,SubPenny to Pennies The Incredible Percentage Gain,9kg8t4,otcninja,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kg8t4/subpenny_to_pennies_the_incredible_percentage_gain/,1,13," 

Sub Penny to Pennies The Incredible Percentage Gain

Who doesn’t like to make 50, 100, 200 percent on their money? I’t an obvious answer but what most traders miss is how to do this. Well there are sub penny stocks out there that just well may have had one or more of the following.

1. Unqualified 	management that may know how to operate a business but not a public company.
2. Borrowed to 	much money and over leveraged the share structure.
3. Undervalued purchases of companies for x amount of shares causing low returns that do not equal to what the market could absorb.

I am sure there are many more to list but you get the gist of what I am trying to say here.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now what is important are the ways to find the companies that this has happened to and may be on the verge of a turn around. **Here is a perfect example: OTC: INND InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc.**, they make hearing devices. For the first 6 months of 2018 the stock barely traded and at a relatively higher price but towards the end of July of 2018 you could have purchased stock just below a penny, somewhere around $0.007. Many people I am sure did not, I am sure many people did not even know the company existed. (Unqualified management). A few days after they announced a deal with Walmart to sell their products and the stock went crazy. **From $0.01’s to $0.15 making a modest 1,500% Gain.** 

***The key is to know when to get in and get out.*** Here are some ways that can identify a possible turn around for a company.

1. Recent company filings with the state they are incorporated in.
2. Change of management.
3. OTC Markets Stop sign or Yield sign removal.
4. Shareholder 	update filings or even updates on their website/social media account.
5. Recent 	activity on social media for a particular symbol, someone knows something I don’t :)  
 

I may have located one, **Nexus Energy Services, Inc. (OTC: IBGR)** that is definitely worth taking a look at. (They filed the list of officers 9/28/2018 with the secretary of state.)

[https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/corpActions.aspx?lx8nvq=KOfJyTRxmt4QXepc4ON4Rw%253d%253d&amp;CorpName=NEXUS+ENERGY+SERVICES%2c+INC](https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/corpActions.aspx?lx8nvq=KOfJyTRxmt4QXepc4ON4Rw%253d%253d&amp;CorpName=NEXUS+ENERGY+SERVICES%2C+INC).

&amp;#x200B;

It has recently gained about 50% from $0.005 to $0.007 in the past week of trading. (Someone knows something!) There is a Stop sign up on OTC Markets but with this recent corporate action the most plausible next action would be to update the shareholders and that could be the take off point. Do your DD and be smart!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this and if you have any info or would like to share a possible turn around happening please do/ I will be happy to do some DD on it.

&amp;#x200B;

If I come up with any more info I will share it! If your interested follow my posts :) Thank you.

3,MGTI may have finally bottomed out,9kka3u,coltonmusic15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kka3u/mgti_may_have_finally_bottomed_out/,1,4,"I've watched this stock for the last 3 years or so as I was interested back when Mcafee was involved (scammer btw) and when they were mining for bitcoin as I thought that might have some value. Looks like since I stopped paying attention, it pumped over $8 and has now finally fallen all the way down to as low as .09 cents a share. I'm buying here for the hell of it. We'll see if the company can make a turn around they are being sued in a class action lawsuit and also have some legal issues they are facing so don't be surprised if this thing drops to $0.00. But I threw in $150 for ***ts and giggles. ",2018-10-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kka3u/mgti_may_have_finally_bottomed_out/

26million float, which is very low for an otc stock. 80%insider ownership. Catalysts and prs coming.

Selling real products on amazon - https://www.amazon.com/l/18053639011 great reviews.

With this tiny float, a huge short squeeze run up could be coming. It’s very possible that it could test the 52 week high of .0799 and break above it. Currently trading at .023.

15,Sure trader,9kkz16,Pureevil1992,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kkz16/sure_trader/,1,5,"So I've been learning a lot about day trading over the last few months. I feel like i have a good enough understanding to start trying it and i plan on taking a 2 week vacation from my job soon to give myself a chance to learn by doing for once, for now I've just been playing long or swing trades and been moderately successful. I live in and am a citizen of the U.S.

I'm wondering if using suretrader is a good option for this. Without it i cannot beat the PDT rule, i could day trade i guess twice a week using etrade, But i feel like only being able to play 2 days a week would severely hamper both my potential profits and learning opportunities. I know suretrader isn't supposed to be used by people residing in the US, but i also know some people have started with them to avoid the PDT just as i'm trying to do. I'm mainly wondering what the risks are, will the SEC block or fine me? Are there any other penalties or risks i should be aware of? I was already able to open a free demo account and from what i understand as long as they didn't solicit me and i still pay taxes correctly there shouldn't be any issues. Is that correct?
