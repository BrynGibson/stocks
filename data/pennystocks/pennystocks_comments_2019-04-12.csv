CFRX is in a reversal. It might come back down to the 49 c  testing that support and  continue it upward trend. It‚Äôs been under the 1$ range for over 3 months. Be careful of a reverse split on this one . IF it stays on the trend it has strong resistance at 83 c 
    CFRX is also in a reversal but has already pulled back  to test 28 c and could continue with the uptrend. Resistance is between 45- 50 c  range . This is also a low float stock. It will move faster and with news has a range of 70 c in a day 
   The bad news is it‚Äôs been under a 1$ sense August. It will be required to get its price above 1$ soon
