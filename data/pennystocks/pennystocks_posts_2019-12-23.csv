PREV 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,eelltm,Gab2506,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eelltm/asterion_awarded_medicinal_cannabis_licences_from/,1,0,"**December 23, 2019, Vancouver, British Columbia: Asterion Cannabis Inc.** (“**Asterion**” or the “**Company**”) announces that its wholly-owned Australian subsidiary (“**Asterion Australia**”) has received its licences for the cultivation, manufacturing and research of medicinal cannabis (the “**Licences**”) from the Australian Government’s Office of Drug Control (“**ODC**”), effective December 20, 2019.  
 

“This is a major milestone for Asterion as it prepares to commence work on its industry leading medicinal cannabis cultivation and processing facility near Toowoomba in South East Queensland, Australia” (the “**Toowoomba Facility**”) stated Mr. Stephen Van Deventer, Asterion’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “Asterion is delighted that it has passed through the ODC’s rigorous assessment process and been awarded the licences it requires to establish its flagship project.  The ODC approvals represent a major step for Asterion towards the manufacturing of pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis at our planned 75 ha (185 acre) Toowoomba Facility.”  


Stephen Van Deventer, further stated, “Asterion intends to commence work on the Toowoomba Facility in the first quarter of 2020 and is expected to commence cultivation of its first crop in 2022. On completion, the Toowoomba Facility is expected to employ more than 1,000 people harvesting more than 20,000 plants a day, and to generate an estimated AUD $2 billion annually in exports, while also supplying medicinal cannabis to the Australian market.  Asterion is committed to its program of innovation across the supply chain, with the goal furthering the development of medicinal cannabis–based pharmaceuticals to provide a safe and effective treatment for a variety of medical conditions.”  
 

The Licences authorize Asterion Australia to cultivate cannabis plants and process them into a range of medicinal cannabis products, including natural dried cannabis flower, (across a variety of strains, aimed at specific medical conditions) as well as gel capsules, oils and soluble gels.

Like the title says i'm wondering if anyone knows of any charting platforms that will let someone go back to previous dates and look at/ download charts to use for statistics. Of course i'll be looking for data like float, volume, etc. I'm just not sure which platform would be the best and there's also a chance that I don't know about it. I have heard good things about Think or Swim, but i'm not sure if I want to sign up for a TDAmeritrade brokerage account or not. If this has already been answered than feel free to take the post down and message me with any appropriate answers.",2019-12-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eesb93/looking_for_a_charting_platform_to_document_stock/

8,Anyone think this is possible,eehio8,SkitziTwoPointOh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eehio8/anyone_think_this_is_possible/,1,15,"So recently a friend and I both decided to download Robinhood and put a little money into it, kinda lost interest when I found out they dont allow day trading unless you have a cash balance of $25,000. However, him trying to keep my head in it decided to make a bet that I personally feel is impossible given restrictions on robinhood. Both start with 20 dollars, first one to 1000 takes the others money. I havent agreed to it, because again I feel it's impossible. Youd have to double the twenty and reinvest the full double up 4 times to be over 100 nor the less reach 1000.

My question is, and please keep in mind, my investment knowledge isnt everything one would need to know, but more then someone just getting into investing, is this type of thing possible, what are peoples opinions of the robinhood app, and where would be a good place to start reading to get more in depth knowledge without having to pay 1000s on the learning material?",2019-12-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eehio8/anyone_think_this_is_possible/
