If the average Brooks ratio is less than 40%, the market outlook is bullish; above 60% signals a bearish outlook.

Yeah MSMY and WUHN both went up 2000+%

Now the share structure for MGON was released by IVS and is said to have a ***SUB 100 MIL FLOAT***

Low floaters can run VERY high and very fast - like double digits fast. Now a trending sector would be great for this like Blockchain, weed, Oil &amp; Gas, etc. I think the most important thing is just a profitable company. Seeing IVS’s track record - I think we are in good shape here!

I’d be getting in tomorrow and enjoy the ride - IVS is clearly sitting on the info and just WAITING to release it. Will do it during market hours imo (although this is not a definite!). I think the implications of this stock going parabolic on hype alone is VERY REAL. But as stated, throw in a good company and it’s a goldmine like WUHN.

69,openworked,dzi4bz5,/r/pennystocks/comments/8lc5m9/mgon_merger_play/dzi4bz5/,1,Up 20% but didn't want to cash out just yet based on all the stuff you spouted about IVS. I should've known this was just a pump and sold the rumor.,2018-05-22

ASCM is a market maker that is soaking up shares so that tells me he either is collecting for the ride back up, or he is covering a short from an olddddddd position. I never seen ASCM on the L2s before 

Not the best news to open to for sure. Do what ever you feel is good my man. This one is moving in volume so people are buying back up, but lot of selling too. Will be interesting to see who wins - the bulls or the bears

Just hard not for me to take those profits.

I’m sorry if your under your buy price currently. Did you have a stop loss set? 

Are you holding now? I’m watching for re entry. ",2018-05-22
