Low float with 63% insider ownership. Volume seems to be picking up and share price is consolidating after a recent rise to 3.50ish on announcement of the antibody test.

Apparently they are working to get a breakthrough status for their primary drug candidate to treat metastatic breast cancer, and the same drug has shown significant positive effect on covid 19 patients.


Charlie sheen took it to treat his HIV and also reportedly had great success with it.

The company had a scheduled interview on making money with charles Payne  on fox business but it was rescheduled to next week , april 8.

I sincerely think this is one of those rare chances to buy a penny biotech before it moons. 

TAKE A LOOK while you can still buy it low.

If this has even 1/3 of their applications approved by the FDA it will be a 5 or 10 bagger.

Can you even imagine if the drug gets breakthrough designation for cancer ontop of treating the virus AND being used globally? 

Theres NO treatments for Covid 19 right now and this is an actively IN USE treatment which great success thus far in around 10 patients with severe coronavirus effects. 

They're attempting to test it in mild to moderate cases...aka everyone who gets it.

21,Question on Theory,fv1g6v,daved229,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fv1g6v/question_on_theory/,1,4,"I am going to have a little expendable cash to play around with and I am looking at making a small entry into the realm of penny stocks. By education and vocation, I am data analyst so I feel like I can pull and manipulate the data as I need to for informed volume and pricing, however, in looking and reading at and about the penny stocks, it is obvious that they fluctuate with the news cycles and, I a assuming, by sector news. Obviously, everyone right now is hot on the plague and the oil futures, but in a :normal"" day to day trading cycle, how many of you specialize in sectors? I have worked off and on in the trucking world all my life. I know a lot about transportation, from driving to dispatching to analytics. Conversely, I know how to spell medicine and that is about the extent of it. I can see where watching a couple of sectors would be beneficial, however, watching all sectors would be impractical. Again, this is taking world events into consideration, and finding that one stock that is going to explode. But how often do we have worldwide pandemics? Well, that we actually take serious.

This will be the next big mover in the OTC.,fuzpwl,virus_stocks100,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fuzpwl/gcgx_complete_dd_package_for_those_who_were/,5,29,"Had a bunch of people ask for DD on $GCGX over the last week. Originally, I posted some DD before their big move. Now, its round 2 and the company released a bunch of new stuff. So, here is some DD for you all. Please, as always, do your own DD and what not. I have been following this company for two years when they announced they wanted to do all these things. 2 years later, they actually made it. 

# Their Twitter account:

They have all of a sudden became VERY active on twitter, with some big announcements on twitter leading to PRs. 

**Here are some of the big company tweets to pay special attention to:**

Announcement that their next revs could be in the 7 figures:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1242791018329706498?s=20 

CONFIRMATION that their next quarterly report will have $1.4 million in revenues:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1243520496370622464?s=20 

This one is huge. Hinting of a share-buy back:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1243612815694405640?s=20 

Correction that its actually 1.5 million and not 1.4:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1245353093417623552?s=20 

Recent tweet saying this big quarterly report will be posted as early as next week:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1246132440051126279?s=20 

Tweeted just now: All t heir inspections have passed. Its all official now:  https://twitter.com/Global\_GCGXOTC/status/1246487885638971392?s=20 

&amp;#x200B;

**Major announcement what would happend if they passed all inspections (Which they just did as of TODAY).** 

&gt; [$GCGX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GCGX&amp;src=cashtag_click) \- Indulge Oils: Presents a 4 liter, batch now considered “Supreme Purity” can be refined to over 90 if needed.  This will yield FAR greater than our estimated $7,000 per liter.   LOI:  Production for 25 liters per day $7000+ Per Liter Revenues from this: $175,000 per day 

&amp;#x200B;

**Company confirms they will be uplisting and initiating a share buy back, just 2 days ago.** 

&gt;Yes, the plan is now uplisting, confirmation of share buy back, and dramatically increasing revenues month over month now that the inspections are complete and can initiate the LOI, which is open for roughly $150,000 per day of oil. 

&amp;#x200B;

**News came out that the oil they were producing came out as 10 points HIGHER in purity, which means it sells for MORE than they expected.** 

&gt; [$GCGX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GCGX&amp;src=cashtag_click) \- Indulge Oils: Presents a 4 liter, batch now considered “Supreme Purity” can be refined to over 90 if needed.  This will yield FAR greater than our estimated $7,000 per liter.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think within April we will be over $0.01 - And for the next quarter if the revenues continue, I see it hitting $0.05 with ease. 

Hope this all helps.",2020-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fuzpwl/gcgx_complete_dd_package_for_those_who_were/
