OTC Disclosure &amp; News Service

WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acorn Energy, Inc. (OTCQB:ACFN), announced today that it has reached an agreement to sell its remaining 41.15% interest in DSIT Solutions Ltd. for $5.8 million, before fees and taxes, to an Israeli investor group. The sale of the DSIT stake represents one of the final steps in refocusing Acorn on the long-term growth potential of its OmniMetrix wireless remote monitoring and control services for gas pipelines and stand-by generators for cell towers, medical facilities, data centers, public transportation systems and other facilities. The transaction is expected to close within about 30 days, subject to specific closing conditions, including approval of the Israeli Antitrust Authority.

DSIT Solutions provides underwater sonar and acoustic detection systems and is 50% owned by Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. DSIT generated revenues of $17.9 million in the latest-twelve-month period ended September 30, 2017.

Acorn CEO Jan Loeb commented, “Concluding a two-year restructuring effort, we have executed an agreement to complete Acorn’s transformation from an undercapitalized, diversified holding company with negative operating cash flow, to a focused leader in the growing market for the remote monitoring and control of industrial assets with a solid balance sheet.

“Proceeds from the sale will be used to eliminate Acorn’s debt, satisfy liabilities and provide working capital. Following the transaction, we expect to have approximately $2 million of cash, which we believe is sufficient to fund the operations of Acorn and OmniMetrix for the foreseeable future. We plan to update our shareholders in greater detail on our financial positon and growth strategy following the closing of the DSIT sale.”

After reading about InterCloud Systems and a once prominent company that traded in the high 60$ range in 2014, now is at the bottom of the barrel .003. After what seems like riding the tech wave at the time and taking on toxic debt and diluting shares they find themselves here.  The ceo has said the right things about the turn around and restructuring ,I’d still guess bankruptcy is still on the table. I love a good comeback story and betting a few hundred bucks on something even if there is a 1% chance of it happening still seems like a bet I’m willing to make. This article dives into the financials a little more. Fire away!

Their products and possible long term success.,7s89aw,MyNameIsRobPaulson,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7s89aw/bpmx_biopharmx_their_products_and_possible_long/,29,24,"So after hearing some hype on this stock, I've done some DD, invested, and am curious as to what others think about BPMX. 

Everyone seems to be short on it, due to it, you know, being a penny stock and all.

BUT, what's more exciting to me, is the possibility of this company actually achieving real success. 

I'll focus on BPX-01:

**BPX-01** - Its an acne gel that delivers minocycline, a very effective acne treatment in use since the 70s, topically.  Previous to this, minocycline has been only available as a pill, and when taken orally has a METRIC SHIT-TON of side effects. like... 
 
From WebMD:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, dizziness, or a feeling of spinning may occur. 

SO... 

BPX-01 has passed Phase 2b - and was proven to work.  

&gt;""In a phase 2a clinical study, BPX-01 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in facial P. acnes after four weeks of once-daily treatment with no measurable systemic levels of minocycline and no drug-related adverse effects.""
http://www.biopharmx.com/pipeline/bpx-01-acne/

My thought is, if BPX-01 has all of the benefits of an acne medication that has been used since the 70s (proving it has a lasting, stable demand) but effectively gets rid of the side effects, how much of an opportunity is this?  Could we see BPX-01 on shelves in pharmacies around the country?  Granted, anything can happen, but also, what if they could succeed here? What would that mean for the market cap/share price?  


These are my only concerns.  There are already three topical anti-biotics for acne on the market... but, they do have side effects.  I would be curious to hear if BPX-01 has clear advantages over the following existing gels:

**Clindamycin:** The most commonly prescribed topical antibiotic for treating acne, available in multiple forms, including lotion, gel, or a liquid solution. Those taking clindamycin for acne generally experience few side effects, which can include mild skin irritation.

**Erythromycin:** Stops the growth of bacteria. Also available in lotion, gel, or liquid form. Often applied twice daily.

**Dapsone:** Another prescribed topical antibiotic for acne. Side effects are rare but can include peeling, red and dry skin.
