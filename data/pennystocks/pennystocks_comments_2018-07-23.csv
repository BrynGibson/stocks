That is gambling based off others speculations which mostly comprise of everyone showing the same rhetoric that you did in your post. You should be researching how to value a company, read their website, research the products they are trying to push, study the history of the stock during the up and down swings correlating to news and updates, check the CEO's, CFO's, etc. twitter and any social media you can find, and try to find some semblance of fodder for a price rise. Then you can gamble with some better understanding. ",2018-07-23

5,MarcosSmallHands,e2wa6f7,/r/pennystocks/comments/9171li/bpmx_discussion/e2wa6f7/,1,"I'm assuming your a novice investor and still learning the ropes. For that, I hope these comments on here do not discourage you but only encourage you to continue education and be able to make sound investments on your own merit. A good start for someone without any form of education is to watch the warren buffet book lessons on youtube. Helps lay the ground work for the beginnings of value investing.

Now to BPMX. This is a penny stock that is susceptible to the pump and dump game. For example, just last week volume flew past the average  increasing the price to .26 only to fall back to todays .22ish. And that was with absolutely no news. If you want to form the long opinion on this stock you need to understand the next breakout in price is hinging on the announcement of the partnership to fund their product BPX-01. With a partnership they will have additional monies to fund their clinical trial and have easier access to market their product if it receives FDA Approval. 

If no partnership is formed,stock will not increase or worse/likely fall fast. Which is why in the most recent voting materials they included the option to do a Reverse Split. For when the stock falls, they reduce the number outstanding shares raising the price and making it appear to have an attractive price. ",2018-07-23

I waited till mitch did an ama, people asked what were the plans to keep it alive. And the response's he gave out was everywhere, he seemed to dodge each question about the stocks saying we got something but we cant say. 
As for me; what bothered me is mitch kept saying they are a start up since 2011 and they still have no real goal how to keep investor, just dilute the company further more. In addition they are trying to raise 1.2 billion  more in funding to me this is crazy. What start up needs 1 billion? 
To me it seems they are going to pump the stock to keep them alive till the cash runs out.

But they need to stay alive for that to happen.  If they reverse split, it's going to probably slide right back down to 10 cents again if they can't get institutional buy in right away.  The stock has to have a minimum stock price for some institutions to even touch it, so that may be what they are going for.

That being said, I do not think investors will back out anytime soon as they see the long term on the idea that MP is. Skeptics predicted the company to fall by the end of 2017, then again in May then June and now its July 2018 with no end in sight especially from investors. 

There is a very large sense of confusion as to how they will be profitable and movie tickets are not it. It will be the concessions, the experiences outside the theatre (restaurants) and other sponsorships and collaboration.
