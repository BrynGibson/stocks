INVU; I've  been able to triple every dollar from $0.012 - $0.018\~ but its hard to  profit off of small volume. For Penny stocks, I stay with those that I  know and am familiar with tenure.

**Financial Results for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2019:**

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were $2,311,425 vs. $847,471 in the prior year's quarter, an increase of 173%, and a 21% sequential increase over the second quarter ended June 30, 2019. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our wholly-owned subsidiary Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, and an increase of fee income generated from the Company's web-based supplier-to-pharmacy trading platform ([www.trxade.com](http://pr.report/u0B4VXHA)).

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $1,310,509, resulting in a gross margin of 56.7%, compared to $845,126 and 99.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in gross profit reflected a sales mix with greater revenue from specialty pharmaceutical sales, which carries a higher cost of sales, reflecting the lower margins, than the Company's other revenue sources.

General and administrative expenses increased to $1,132,656 in the third quarter of 2019, compared with $753,297 in the prior year's quarter.

Operating income increased for the third quarter of 2019 to $177,853, versus $91,829 in the prior year's quarter.

Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019, was $27,565, a decrease as compared to net income of $94,249, for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a one time investment loss of $162,178. Earnings per share (EPS) for the three months period ended September 30, 2019 were $0.00, as compared to $0.00 for the same period in 2018.

**Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019:**

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $5,740,361 vs. $2,538,082 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of 126%. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of our wholly-owned subsidiary Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, and an increase of fee income generated from the Company's web-based supplier-to-pharmacy trading platform ([www.trxade.com](http://pr.report/YspoRwfu)).

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $3,620,467, resulting in a gross margin of 63%, compared to $2,535,737 and 99.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. This increase reflected a sales mix with greater revenue from Specialty pharmaceutical sales, which carries a higher cost of sales, reflecting the lower margin, than the Company's other revenue sources.

General and administrative expenses increased to $3,138,150 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $2,313,734 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Operating Income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $482,317, versus $222,003 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, was $210,775, compared to net income of $197,031, for the same period in 2018. The improvement in net income was primarily due to increasing revenue and gross profit contributed from Community Specialty Pharmacy and an increase in fee income generated from the Company's web-based supplier-to-pharmacy trading platform ([www.trxade.com](http://pr.report/1FLHMIKs)). The resulting EPS for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 was $0.01, as compared to $0.01 for the same period in 2018.",2019-10-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dpq4dy/trxd_trxade_group_generates_record_revenues_in/
6,Opinions on Investing in SNAP?,dppbwu,adavidson1698,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dppbwu/opinions_on_investing_in_snap/,1,3,"I will openly admit I’m not an advanced investor by any means. I’ve been investing for a couple years as a hobby. Now that I’ve cleared that up I want to ask your opinions on investing in SNAP. I’ve read a lot of people saying it’s not the time to invest, but with snap being so cheap I feel like it is a snag right now. Snap has a wide base of users and I see potential for it to take off just like Facebook did. The reason I say this is because of the advertising capabilities. I can’t see why companies wanting to target younger demographics wouldn’t want to advertise through Snapchat. The way I see it is that while although Facebook remains strong and popular that it’s soon to become a social media of the past like MySpace. Again I come asking for opinions because I admit I’m not an experienced investor. So please keep the bashing of my opinion to a minimum. I am here asking advice for a reason.",2019-10-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dppbwu/opinions_on_investing_in_snap/
