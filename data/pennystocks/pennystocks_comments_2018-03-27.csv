PR they pump out and the company is pretty quick to reply to investors. 

The main catalyst for the next run is waiting on the QVC air date, but that could all be a rumor. One of the executives posted pictures of his trip to QVC and claimed they are an approved vendor in February. Though no other information has been given other than they are waiting to hear about the airtime and will announce it when they find out.

The downsides to the company are a few. They like to dilute so a run could only get to .0015 before the company dilutes it down again. There is a large amount of stock 15 billion shares in all as of February. The companies they have are all in their infancy and need to be built up.

There are better companies out there, but for the most part I think it is worth the risk at this point in time. Though if it doesn't run by July I will probably cut my loses because there will be a reverse split in the future, but I doubt it will happen in the next few months because they just split the shares in February.

Do your own DD as always and good luck investing.

Just to make it clear penny stock companies don't usually follow the fundamentals of a normal company, which is why I wouldn't read the 10k or any other filings, they're usually just based off news and in this case, for me, the news had past and I'm still holding on to it which is worrying me. Can you explain to me what OTCQB and OTC Pink exchange is? (Google isn't very helpful)",2018-03-27
25,zimboombah,dwrz2y9,/r/pennystocks/comments/87n283/celz_multiday_otc_breakout_and_announced_it_has/dwrz2y9/,1,"From what I understand it is the middle tier of the OTC market place. Besides having to maintain a  .01 share price, they are required to report and disclose company events and finances where the pink sheets are not. I think companies that want to eventually be listed on the Nasdaq or NYSE have to work their way up the tiers. The next one is OTCQX.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqb.asp

One primary motivation for staying listed on the OTCQB is for a wider range of investors to be interested in them and take them seriously - not only discerning retail investors but investment houses and traders that have more stringent requirements for which companies they can invest in.

The question really is whether these guys are in it for the long haul or just running a scam - dumping shares and running the ocmpany into the ground. ",2018-03-27
