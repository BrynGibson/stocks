Freedom Challenge + Duxinator + Trading Techniques: **ALL for $35USD.**

By far the best deal for his DVD's. Not being scummy, these DVD's cannot be torrented and can only be bought. Steven sells all the above DVD's for over $5000, and various websites resell his DVD's for close to $200. So this is seriously a bargain.

Thanks :)",2019-11-19

Also watching $TSB as it's being added to the London Stock Exchange by Friday morning. 

Not a strong day, but I haven't been looking for leads since most of my money is tied up rn anyway. Afraid to get out of $AGRX and $OGEN then be out when they take off.

$OGEN seems like it may never take off but I swear it has a lot of potential.",2019-11-19
