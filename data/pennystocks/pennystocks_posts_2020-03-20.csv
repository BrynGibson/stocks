2,$GNUS Due Diligence,flpyob,Twinscomeintwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/flpyob/gnus_due_diligence/,1,15,"
This stock is poised to double - if not a triple-  in the coming week to month. 

Catalysts on the Horizon: 

1) Conference call Friday at 10:00 am CST with an update to the business strategy, roll out of their merchandise and the biggest of all - 

2) The planned release of their new show: Stan Lee's Super Kindergarten starring Arnold  Schwarzenegger. 

Background on the second one: ""Partnership was formed between Genius Brands and the Alibaba Company of China.¬† Alibaba, China‚Äôs largest company,¬† will co-produce *Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten* with us, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as distribute, promote, and oversee licensing of consumer products and merchandising in China.""

To add to that they just announced that one of their core shows Rainbow Rangers had the amount of airings per week increased to 26 by Nickelodeon. 

With coronavirus grounding people at home, you can imagine the viewership of these shows is only bound to increase. Once Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten hits the airwaves, the upside will finally be realized. Tapping the US market is a start, having the product co-produced and distributed to China is pure rocket fuel. 

I do currently own shares and intend to see it through the conference and the release of one of their soon to be flagship products.

-The BW property group twitter had a tweet ab ordering 12000 total tests but deleted it, likely after people from StockTwits began reaching out to their live chat and bugging them for answers.

28,DECN: ANNOUNCEMENT,flvi0y,JohnnyLakefront,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/flvi0y/decn_announcement/,1,50,"DECN just made an announcement. 

For those who don't know, DECN has been a hot topic around here. They announced recently that they will be getting in the covid testing have with an affordable at home testing kit.

A couple weeks ago they were at .02 cents, yesterday they made it up to nearly .25 cents.

They project 525 million units sold in the first 12 months @ about $7.00 per unit.

Today they announced that they've taken out a near 0% interest loan of $13 million to boost production of their covid-19 test.

These people are NOT fucking around. $13 million into the project to have this ball rolling.

Here's the announcement: 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decn-finance-2q-2020-roll-125500363.html


They also mention that people are contacting THEM for partnerships. People are clawing at their door to partner with DECN.

and on that note, here's a very interesting article from last year. This article is talking about their current diabetes test kits, but it's very interesting who they already have contacts with.

Someone is going to have to help them distribute these tests, and apparently they've already been shaking the right hands:

TLDR: They may float through this crisis, but long term I don't see them lasting as a public company. My positions are a few naked $2.50 puts because IV was stupid high and I can't believe someone paid me for them. Even with the 50% price drop today, I'm still profitable.

[My initial post was trying to gauge if anyone in this sub followed them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e381f6/wtrh_waitr_holdings/) This inquiry was a little more than three months ago, and was in no way related to the beer virus. I held 30 $2.50 6/17 calls I bought at the beginning of the year, and held up til a month ago that I sold for break even. I was anticipating on them either performing a [reverse split or delisting by this summer.](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/article_b5cce83a-f6a0-11e9-b1e7-479d63e3e73f.html)

What's my experience? 

* I live in their corporate city and have been a customer since they opened.
* I worked for them as a contract driver for three months, and after one month was a lead training driver for new hires.
* Several close friends who worked in the corporate office.
* And without disclosing too much, my primary job included a direct relationship with them for key financial transactions related to operations during their start up. Conditions of me working for them temporary included not being directly involved for servicing their account as a conflict of interest.

Waitr was founded, great company. Revolutionary, etc. Their value came in their system and app development - which is second to none. They were a home town company that was able to scale because of key investors, and essentially buying out other startups before they could get their wheels turning.

* [Drew Brees because he is a key owner in Walk-Ons, which was one of the top restaurants for Waitr. Essentially he was finding a way to double dip his own sales and scalp other restaurants in the process.](https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/money/business/2017/03/10/waitr-gets-10m-new-funding-led-drew-brees/99010352/)

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives that influence my position:

Without being nerdy and spouting numbers, they have not turned a real profit since inception. Analogy - They were able to complete a 5K (local ops), but then decided they were in good enough shape to do a triathlon. Going public way to soon. [Their catalyst for explosive growth was trying to acquire bite squad, which was an utter failure and resulted in a nearly $220 MM loss.](https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2019/11/08/after-321m-deal-for-bite-squad-newowner-writes.html) [Tim Fertitta essentially paid $620 MM cash (Waitr and Bite Squad), and allowed the current owners to keep a large portion of the company - WHICH MADE NO MONEY.](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/business/article_8755e2cc-ba19-11e9-983b-5f599635e270.html)

After going public, they disclosed a major overhaul of their fee/commission structure with restaurants which dramatically altered their forecasted financials. [This has lead to the former CEO stepping down, and the company being investigated and facing class action for securities fraud.](https://reveallafayette.com/2019/10/a-class-action-lawsuit-creates-an-uncertain-future-for-waitr/)

Changing the commission structure and platform terms pissed off all restaurants. First progressive fees based on order volume, second was price control. The only ones that were viable and stayed on the app were the ones with the most volume (BWW, Walkons, a few local chains with high orders). Most likely restaurants in quarantine focus cities will hop back on for now, but I would assume only short term.

Drivers originally were 1099 contract (like I was) then shifted to be FTEs with benefits. Hourly drivers were paid $5 per hour plus gratuities, against minimum wage. Do you think they could pay FTEs and benefits for someone bringing in $10-$20 per hour of revenue (deliver fees, and restaurant commission)? As a lead driver I could tell you that my estimate is less than 25% of drivers were efficient and profitable for the company. People were fired constantly for clocking in to be paid  minimum wage and only accepting orders when they were called out just to stay active.

[The company has now switched back to full contract fleet in order to cut benefit and ancillary FTE costs. Contract drivers are paid $2.50 per delivery plus gratuities, against minimum wage.](https://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/business/article_e6044922-46d1-11ea-9a7c-f764e92356d6.html)

I can't speak to the class action in detail, however I think in order to turn the ship around they will have to change their business model to shift more cost to the customer VIA higher deliver fees instead of pissing off restaurants.

There may be a pump here and there because of food delivery spikes due to beer flu, but once I close these positions - I'm taking them off my watchlist for good.

Rob Low is our new best friend. He is a reporter in the Denver area. He said that the tests ‚Äúcould be coming‚Äù this upcoming week. AND he says that there have been talks between the Colorado governor and AYTU. The governor would not mention the kits to the public until he has them for sure, because imagine the backlash if he didn‚Äôt come through. 

Second: https://twitter.com/sencorygardner/status/1241091106336657408?s=21

Got recognition from a Colorado senator. Keep in mind, both these tweets have mentioned working with the FDA. Another key thing. 

People on StockTwits claim that they have confirmed the kits arrived in the US using some website but that‚Äôs above me so I cannot confirm nor deny it. 

Monday (or any day next week I suppose) is shaping up to be a potentially huge day:
-Possible announcement of kits finally in AYTU‚Äôs possession
-Possible announcement of a deal with the state of Colorado, and other orders lined up ideally. (See my post from yesterday about that property management company) 
-The closing of the latest offering 

Lots of us have waited long enough, sat through crazy drops and haven‚Äôt sold a share. Let‚Äôs hope all the stars align and Monday is a huge day, preferably with one huge premarket PR.",2020-03-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fm2chs/it_is_finally_time_for_aytu/

Is it really as simple as people getting freaked out by the public offerings? Product delivery too slow? Shorts?
