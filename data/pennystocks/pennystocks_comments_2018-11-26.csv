I‚Äôm up almost 60% and will add shares tomorrow if the moment is right. Best time to buy is early in the am or late in the day. Day-traders dump their shares right before 4:00 est everyday, the late day bulls are kind enough to buy the share price right back up before closing almost every day too...it‚Äôs pretty amazing. If it‚Äôs a red day tomorrow for RGSE, (there has only been a few in the past 10 days), just be patient and make your buy, right in what you think the biggest dip will be. Lastly, make sure the RSI is below 40 when you buy in and your almost guaranteed an instant upside position. Then it‚Äôs just to Infinity and beyond...... ",2018-11-26
