It has now pulled back and is consolidating at .0015. Every year, there are several stocks that run from .0001 to multi - pennies. LDSR, ANDI, NHPI, SRMX, are just a few recent examples. I think KATX is the potential next OTC  to make the 100x run, from .0001 to .01+. Here's some DD. Disclaimer: I'm holding 3m shares, not looking to pump. Just sharing my thoughts. I posted about NHPI in this subreddit when it was trading at .0013.

&amp;#x200B;

A new company twitter popped up recently: [https://twitter.com/KAT\_Exploration](https://twitter.com/KAT_Exploration) . In this tweet, ""[~~$~~**KATX**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24KATX&amp;src=ctag) Good Afternoon Shareholders Proud to Report Active Status for Kat Exploration Inc in Nevada this afternoon"" the company confirmed they are reinstated. SOURCE: [https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSEntitySearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=J8szY3FcAPHkNelvFsm4DA%253d%253d](https://www.nvsos.gov/SOSEntitySearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=J8szY3FcAPHkNelvFsm4DA%253d%253d) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a believer that companies don't pay money for this unless they have plans in the near term. This is where it gets more interesting - Canadianexploration inc has same address and phone number listed on their website.  They also own the Cabot fields which they are running Graphite tests on.  Graphite is used in everything from pencils, to batteries.  US has no graphite mines, and Canada has only 2. SOURCE: [http://www.canadianexplorationinc.com/](http://www.canadianexplorationinc.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

Is this going to be a merger? Very good chance.

&amp;#x200B;

With this low float, a possible merger, company working on pink current status I think this ticker has potential to explode just as NHPI recently did. The float is only about 750m, and this trades very thin. With the right updates, this could really go to pennies but DYOR as always. This is speculative at the moment, but everything points to a merger.",2018-12-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a84hhs/katx_looks_like_it_is_setting_up_for_a_huge_move/

12,Watchlist,a8agez,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a8agez/watchlist/,1,1,"DOMO - as mentioned previously, this stock was directed downward and several people made a nice profit on shorting this bad boy. The stock had previous resistance around $23 and could not surpass, so based on the same fundamental patterns that have been proven to work year after year, it reversed at that previous level of resistance. Breakout trading works!  


OZM - A lot of traders didn't believe me when I said this stock would continue to head down IF the following condition was met: had to surpass previous resistance @ $1.62. It could not, so can you guess what happened? It start to fall, and is now near a divisible by 5 level @ $1.00/share.  


IAG - Stock is steadily creeping higher and has a lot of resistance @ $4.00. Currently it is at $3.73. Some traders are already buying in hopes it can surpass $4.  


INPX - A lot of traders see this stock is up 37%, but be advised, it was up over 80% earlier in the day. Don't start investing your money in a stock that has depreciated that much in a day. Move on and find another stock to get it. Remember, it's all about timing. Most people get in too late, only to end up losing money. You need to learn to get in and get out.

17,$GTHP,a8c8sk,Zak-kai,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a8c8sk/gthp/,1,3,"Has news on signing a manufacturing, supply and royalty agreement.

“The agreement enables Newmars to manufacture LuViva® Advance Cervical Scan devices in Hungary for distribution in the nine Central and Eastern European countries for which Newmars has distribution rights. GTHP will manufacture sub-assemblies and sell these and other parts to Newmars and will receive an additional $2,000 royalty for each device sold in those countries, which include Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Armenia.

Guided Therapeutics will continue to sell single use, disposable Cervical Guides to Newmars and they are not part of the new agreement. Newmars projects sales of over 700 LuViva devices and over 1.5 million Cervical Guides. Combined with the previously signed distribution agreement, this new agreement is expected to generate approximately $30 million in revenues for GTHP over the next 5 years, with sales beginning in the second half of next year.

“We are encouraged by the work that Newmars has done so far in both Russia and Hungary and we are confident that there is a substantial market in Eastern Europe for LuViva,” said Gene Cartwright, CEO of Guided Therapeutics.

The population of the nine countries is nearly 300 million and the number of women of recommended cervical cancer screening age is over 70 million for these 9 countries.”
