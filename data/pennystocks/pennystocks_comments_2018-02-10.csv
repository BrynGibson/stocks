Both can have negative impact on holders' share value. Merger can go either way, but one side will get the short straw. I've seen a $1 stock go through a merger and shareholders receive $3 shares of the new company with a new ticker only to realize they have 1/4 the number of shares pre-merge (would've done better to sell and buy back in after merge)... Reverse split almost always has a negative impact on short term price. I don't know much about this stock, but my 5 minutes tells me I might wait to see how they come through and maybe look to buy after merger if things still look good. If R/S I'd personally wait it out awhile... 

BUT, don't trust me or anyone else. Do your own research.",2018-02-10

Unfortunately, mistakes with our money can sometimes lead to more mistakes to try to correct them. If you are losing at the poker table, get up and come back when your head is right. Stock trading isn't much different. On the other hand, investing sometimes requires you to just ride out the rough spots. The best advice I think I've heard is to always know if you are investing in a company or trying to make a trade, and never to let one turn into the other by accident when things did not go as planned.",2018-02-10

19,RaidenKing,du1eqqj,/r/pennystocks/comments/7wkabo/what_are_the_best_otc_marijuana_stocks/du1eqqj/,1,"I’ve been following a lot of these for years. A lot can be said about the potential of a few others like GBLX, GRNH and TRTC. However with Growlife or PHOT, you have a stock which returned to normal trading after a while spent on the greys due to an SEC suspension. Returning from the grey market is something you almost never see and is extremely unlikely statistically speaking.

The leadership of Growlife basically resurrected the trading ability of this company and its involved in the picks and shovels side of the industry, meaning they sell equipment for growing as opposed to dealing with the substance directly. Their original flagship site was Greners.com, which was popular for a long while until falling out of favor once the company had to reorganize itself.

A lot of disposables or consumables are used by growers. Plenty of the things like lights, filters, nutrients, mediums and plenty more have finite life spans which means growers will always be repurchasing. Recurring customers mean revolving income.

Considering growing is being scaled way up in legal states and Canada, one can conclude that investing in a company selling those grow supplies is less risky because such a company can sell their products legally in all states and other countries. Growlife recently announced they’ll be working with Canadian growers as well as US, which may extend into new territories like South America in the future.

There’s plenty to NOT like about Growlife as well. Their storied past may turn some away, and their share structure needs serious improvement. Their CEO delivered to shareholders by making the stock viable again, and is working on patents that may reinforce sales.

Always good to take ANYTHING on these boards with a grain of salt, so put this on watch perhaps until their next round of financials come out and they uplist.",2018-02-10

They go up by name alone based on market hype, then quickly deflate once investors have done their due diligence. It’s a shame that scamsters gravitated towards locking down name brand tickers, because the average investor is clueless at first when getting into these and is usually riding the FOMO train of the hype market. It does make finding the legitimate companies more rewarding though.",2018-02-10
