For non dependents, single , federal taxes, if it's your only income, short term gains are 0% for the first 12.4k, 10% on the next 9k, 12% on the next 30k, 22% on the next 50k ect.

For long term gains, 0% on the first 50k, 15% over that.

If you have other income, stack the gains on top of that, and include the other income to figure what brackets the gains fall into. So if you have 30k of other income, and 30k of short term gains, 10k of gains at 12%, 10k of gains at 22%.",2020-05-05

So, if you grossed $500 and your cost basis (what you paid for your stocks) was $250. The net gain was $250. Therefore, you'd pay taxes on $250. Now, that rate depends on how long you held the stock for. If it's less than a year, you get taxed on your marginal income rate. If you held the stock for more than a year, it's capital gains, which depending on your income level is 0%-20%. Unless you're a very high income earner, you'll either pay 0% or 10%.",2020-05-05

Good example of the dangers of options:

Mid Feb. I started options trading with $250.
Early March I was up to $6k
Mid-March I was up to $13k
Held those contracts through that weekend
Fed started pumping the markets with infinite QE that weekend
Dropped to $2k-ish immediately at Monday open.

I'm back up to $5k now, split between penny stocks and options, but yeah... I'd call it greediness, but even so, an unforeseen/untimely force made me lose greatly, even though I was right on all of my picks. Options can definitely be sketch.",2020-05-05

I’d like to say this test is so good FDA is requiring a little extra DD from MedMira because once it’s approved it’s a world-wide no brained, but I don’t have those connections at the FDA. I’m also very confident in WebbDX. Their entire officer list and client list is impressive. They wouldn’t have partnered with MedMira if they weren’t sure it was a foregone conclusion too.

step 1 have 3-6 months full living expenses. In this step you should not be investing at at all. For me this amount is roughly 10k. 

Step 2 start investing a portion of your income. Be it company 401k, roth IRA pennies, etfs etc.  Take smart trades. Do your DD, take winning trades and secure profits when you can. 

Step 3 raise your account to 25k so you can do things like buy and sell on obvious patterns like MACD crossovers l, bollinger band crossovers, bearish/bullish candlesticks, etc. For example if you could day trade as many times as you'd like, you could have made profits end over end on MVIS today. There were very many dips, including the large one cause by the stop hunter. 

Step 4 rinse repeat. From here your money will make more money faster and faster as long as you continue to make good trades. Perhaps you automate a basic process to buy and sell on certain indicators and give it 1k and see what happens. There are many options once you can day trade.",2020-05-05

For me, I’ve been trying to track stocks that are big day gainers and getting into it while the stock is still rising. I’ve often noticed that the next day (during pre market hours), that those stocks either continue to rise, or they tank. I want to be able to get out of the stock the next day if it tanks without being considered a day trader.

Ex: I bough TRNX on 4/20 for .345 which rose as much as .365 after hours that day. Upon waking up at 9 o’clock the next trading day, when trades are happening, the stock begins to tank below its previous day to .28.... I’ve now lost .06 cents a share when I could get rid of it at say .345 to avoid losses, I want to be able to do that if I believe it’s going to tank, without being labeled a day trader.

Bad example there because of how small the difference is but I’ve been in on stocks that raise 50% or more the day I buy it, but also tank the next day by 75% and I want to get out before I realize a loss.",2020-05-05

I've been lurking this sub since I made this account, as well as WallStreetBets and Options, and only recently (Feb-ish) started contributing.

I've seen the userbase of this and WSB skyrocket recently with this pandemic market SNAFU.

I'm worried WSB is going to start flowing over into this subreddit. I enjoy the arrogance and comedy and camaraderie associated with the losses and gains there, but it belongs... There. I've already seen comments that are akin to the general tone of wsb (such as slang used almost exclusively there, endearing or not).

When a brand new movie comes out, movie theaters will have it showing during their PRIME TIME hours. Why? Because they know that is when they will get the most customers. The more volume, the more profits. After the movie comes out, can someone still go see the movie at 7:30 AM? Sure. But the movie theater (and movie itself) will not see as much profits from that time slot.

Simply put, after hour trading was designed for people who wanted to take advantage of off-peak trading times. Typically, there is far less volume after hours which leads to volatility and no guarantees that it will stay at that price point once the market opens. All the major financial institutions and market makers play during the 9:30-4:00 time slot, so that is when you will see the most support (or resistance) for a stock, and with these high volume levels, traders can get a more accurate price average. 

The stock market is run like a business. It has buyers and sellers. It has hours of operation. It sees profits and losses. If it knows that 90% of its customer base will ""shop"" with them between 9:30-4:00, then that is the times they want to stay open. Will they get the occasional customer that walks in at 7:00 PM for a snack? Sure. But that one person is not going to make or break the entire day because of one snack.",2020-05-05

MVIS was in a declining market cap/stock price  trend in the past 3 years.  Microsoft, who has been their partner the whole time and their biggest customer, sees the stock drop well below $1.  MVIS also had to raise capital in the past year to service their debt, and they're losing money.  So the buyer in this case is in a strong position.  I'd guess a small, 20-40% premium over market cap from let's say 6 months ago when negotiations could have started.    Let's call that stock price $1.

You have 2 shares valued at 100$ each. If you sell both, you made 200$, 100$ per share. If you sell one, youve made effectively nothing. Doesnt matter which one, the market doesnt know which specific option youre selling, nor does it matter because it operates at market price. Selling 1 Stock at 100$ gets you 100$, not an extra 50$ from the time you bought in at 50$. People that will sell a portion of their posistion will understand this, people that pump and dumb, may not intuitively understand this. This is how you find break even points.

Companies buy patents all the time.

If Microsoft is BUYING PATENTS from MVIS, why on earth do you think they would be buying them out? That logic makes no sense guys. Microsoft has much better resources at their disposal and can buy patents and make adjustments in house.

So that said, I fail to see how this is relevant to the stock atm at all. To my understanding is that MS contracted out MVIS to work on hololens and through R&amp;D both end up filling for patents to protect the property. Now there might be some understanding between the two companies but I don’t see any of the microvision patents being acquired by Microsoft to indicate that they are buy them out...

Glad to hear you're having fun (because daytrading definitely can be fun) but with limited day trades, you'll be forced to hold any other positions you might decide to buy into. 

Take your time to research the stocks you're thinking of buying into. Majority of people on these subreddits are solely buying hype. They have no idea why they're holding a position, other than the fact that other people said it was a good idea. Kind of sounds like what you did today. (Not dogging you, just trying to give a little advice.) 

Slow down, understand what's happening, understand your own decision making and rational, do your research, try to spot an entry and ideal (realistic) exit point, and then make the decision to jump in. You'll save a lot of day trades and won't be forced to hold when you don't want to.

It sounds like you're swinging, which means entering a position and holding until the next day or longer. 

In other news, you got in MVIS at a decent price! Since it sounds like you're relatively new to this, I'd strongly advise: **setting a stop loss.** Right now, you're making money. You want to exit this position with a profit and setting a stop loss will ensure that. 

Also, don't get greedy! As we all saw today with MVIS, things can turn sour in the blink of an eye. Exit the position when you feel you're happy with the profit, and then find the next opportunity to make money.

They can not manipulate the market by shorting shares lower than the current share price. However, shorts can still absolutely short a stock at the current price, let it drop significantly, wait for a slight uptick, short it again at the new price, wait for a short uptick, and continue to drive a stock to the ground.

In the market, there are buyers and sellers. You are thinking about it only from the eyes of someone who bought the stock and looking to cash out for a profit when it goes up.

This means they SELL a stock at its current price with the hopes the price goes DOWN and then buys back those shares at a cheaper price, thus still generating a profit. The market goes both ways.

That's the exact kind of thing that COULD turn this into wallstreetbets though













I'm not saying you can't have fun here, but finances are serious and we don't want to start catering towards a ""have fun and YOLO your savings into this penny stock"" type atmosphere. I'd prefer we create a responsible, logical-driven environment here, one where we can actually try to help people learn how to research and analyze companies to try and make smart decisions with their investments. 







It doesn't take much for investing to turn into degenerate gambling - ESPECIALLY when it comes to penny stocks. So I think we should try and stray from that where possible. How cool would it be to create a strong community where people can learn and gain financial security through long term investing with their gains from penny stocks. I think that would be great.

DECNs owner was the only owner that I heard was undaunted after the halt. Read about the other halts that day. Complete crimes and absolutely dishonorable and unethical companies. I own 3500 shares and will be set to buy $1000 more. The diabetics tests that he patented were games changers supposedly..first of their kind and he sells his technology to other companies. This company has the potential to do 400,000 test kits a week. The kits are being made and ready to ship upon approval supposedly. There is another larger company holx . Look at their testing technology. I invested 550 shares in hologic at around 30 per share. I was looking for an antibody test company that could do home units or test at work. Bought 200 shares of Roche at 35 per share. Found DECN so already using free money. I got in. Even if DECN is a fart in the wind and the tests don’t get approved cause they are faulty worthless crap I figure $1000 chance at a penny stock that could go to $200,000,000 in revenue is worth a few bucks a share before we find out if its shit. I recommend buy and make your investment back with interest and let it ride until fda approval or denial. If someone knows positively without a doubt this guy is a complete fraudster let me know.

They suspended DECN until May 8th because DECN's CEO had released several PRs hyping up their Coronavirus blood-testing kit that they have yet to receive FDA approval for telling investors that they are expected to sell hundreds of thousands of kits and to my knowledge, at the time of suspension, had yet to even begin working towards producing any proof their kit worked to show the FDA so they could get approval.

These PR's that were made caused the stock shares to go from $0.06 to $0.48 per share which then caused a **MASSIVE** and **suspicious** dump on the day of their last PR.

The next day the SEC suspended trading of DECN stock until May 8th while they investigated the claims that were inside of the PRs made by the CEO to make sure that the claims were valid and this wasn't some pump and dump scamming scheme the CEO executed.

DECN wasn't the only company suspended, others were too and then let back onto the market for trading and some have even bounced back. At the end of the day none of this matters if DECN has a legitimate product that can be approved by the FDA and the CEO is very aggressive and confident he not only has 1 product, but he has 2 products that will receive FDA approval. If this happens this stock, for a lot of us, could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. For transparency, I have 19,919 shares of DECN.

DECN is re-opening for trading on Friday and CBS New York has just put up a video interviewing the CEO about his products. This is very big.",2020-05-05

An update for today: 
Firstly, sorry about planning a stream this evening and not being able to, I got sick. I think the pizza i ate for late lunch may have something to do with it lol. Dumb ass decision by me. So instead I’d at least like to give you an update on my trades this week here and what I’m expecting. I bought TTI at $0.50 last week and sold at $0.40 today for a loss. MVIS SMASHED through my price target of $0.62. I was planning on TTI moving higher today and then moving into MVIS. TTI went totally soft on me and no amount of foreplay could get it up again.  Risked 5% into MVIS at $0.90, saw continued higher movement, risked another 5% at around $0.94, saw MORE movement into $1.00 and bought more at $1.05. My average price is $0.98 with 15% of my account at  risk (way too high but yolo sometimes ya know?) now onto the chart: this is called a pennant continuation pattern, and taking the arrow (initial move up) and using it as a target for our next move up puts us at $1.62 next target. It’s already broken out of that pattern to the upside. $1.62 is also perfectly at monthly resistance (black line). $1.27 was original Fibonacci extension target, but it’s already smashed through that after hours. So who the hell really knows at this point. The fact that mvis had 200,000,000 volume today and was the highest volume in all of the stock market today makes me think that my targets are still too conservative. But I’ve already profited 48.3% on this one trade so I’m going to start locking in profits as we move into Thursday. If you’re looking at getting into this trade, I would suggest buying on dips after you see a bullish reversal candle on the one hour chart, and set your price target to where your reward is higher than your risk. Not financial advice though, I’m not buying any more shares of this. Thursday evening I’m thinking we can do a weekly recap stream and everyone is invited to come chill and bask in all our new tendies. Cheers!",2020-05-05

If this pumps to 3-4 dollars I’ll execute and have those shares up until the first sell off in addition to the shares I already own.  A 2-300 profit real quick is what I was looking for and once I sell everything take all those profits wait for the dip after the call this week. Buy another 100 shares and let that ride for the second call on the 19th. Overall a pretty safe bet to make money while risking 20 dollars for the contract.  Keep in mind that same contract I bought for 20 dollars is now 123 more or less.  So regardless it’s going to pay off as profit no matter what.,2020-05-05

For those of you who don't have an accounting background or don't know what goodwill is. Goodwill is an account that is created when buying a company. generally there is a purchase price (what is being exchanged for the company), and a book value (what the total assets of the company is worth). if the purchase price is greater than the book value then you have goodwill. the main reason why a company would pay more is because they think that the company will continue to grow and increase there earnings. but goodwill can not be used or sold. it is just there and provides no real benefit.

The more revenue a company makes, the more valuable it is, the more the stock price goes up. If an earning report comes out that beats expectations, it’s a good indicator that the company is making good financial gains. This makes stockholders more bullish and likely to hold longer term. Bad earning reports indicate that the company has not lived up to their expectations and likely will see a decrease in stock price and dumping from day and swing traders.

This is to let you know MVIS has a very long, and interesting network with very large companies, yet it hasn't had it's turn in the lime light until the past few days.

I believe the MVIS CEO will not reveal who they are in talks with, but identify they have **MANY** suitors, like the little THOT mvis is.

4868,zakernot1,fpiu1xs,/r/pennystocks/comments/gdo8o8/izea_anyone/fpiu1xs/,3,"The ipo of this company was for only $1 for 3.5 million shares. The reason why the price is so high when looking at previous data is because of reverse stock splits. The main reason why it has done this is because you have to be over $1 for a period of time to be on the nasdaq. Currently they have until mid august to have 10 days in a row to close above $1 or else they get removed from the nasdaq. The closer they get to that date the more likely you will see a vote for a reverse split. 

For the goodwill part. Izea bought companies and paid more then what there assets were worth. To them the payment was justified for future earnings. Due to US GAAP (accounting regulation for the us) goodwill has to be tested ever year to see if it is still worth the same amount (called testing for impairment). To izea the value is still in the companies that they have purchased. They bought companies in 2015, 2016, and 2018 with all of them being slightly over $1 million each. 

I didn’t state this is the first response. But this is not necessarily a bad company to invest in. I would suspect that if they post an income on their earnings, or even a smaller net loss then previous years the stock will have an uptick.  I do not know enough about their products and marketing in general to say anything about their company’s products. But their financials are not enticing. I would say this company has equal chances of going bankrupt and their stock rising to a mark above $5. But in the short term, you can play those earnings, buy on rumors sell on news.

The reason you sell before is because the Microsoft purchase is only a *rumor* at this point until they say it on that conference call, if they even say it. If they don't announce it, or mention it then the stock will tank, hard. 

For a perfect example look at the past week for UAVS. You can clearly see where the rumor hyped the stock up leading into their call last Thursday and then you can see where they announced the CEO was retiring and pretty much nothing else. The bottom fell out on that stock and it was halted several times, when trading resumed from those halts the sell price fell so fast it blew through peoples stop losses and left them with sells at much lower price points. 

Thats what you avoid by selling the day before or before the call. You get to cash in on the hype without risking losing your profit and your initial investment. 

If there is news of Microsoft buying them out you can always buy back in with your profits that you got from selling before the call. News like that will pump the stock up a few more dollars and net you more profit.",2020-05-05

I held on my profit after I sold off the 100% return. I was on the conference call waiting to see if there was confirmation of partnership with Amazon.  I was hoping that those remaining ""profitable"" stocks would skyrocket to make me more profit if this partnership happened.

But it did not-- then the stocks crashed. I put in the limit loss order at a certain limit.  But it got froze.  We couldn't trade with that particular stock for at least 15 minutes.  So we were stuck while people were in a frenzy trying to sell off their stocks-- a competition for who would sell off their loss at the highest prices.

Mine got sold at $1.24 after it went as high as $5.  But fortunately, it's a slight more profit than what my original sell off was. So I'm at ""little gain"" out of UAVS.

The whole point is that the conference call with UAVS was all based on speculation and rumors.  We did not know if Amazon was the partner or not. The conference call was so wonky at its best.  That's why there was this massive sell off.  Everyone who held on their stocks like I did missed out our opportunities to cash out with highest marginal profit at that moment.

So with this MVIS-- it's a bit more hyped up than UAVS but again, we do not know if there is a large company such as MSFT being involved until we go through this conference call just like we did with UAVS.

We're gambling on this if we hold on the stocks until the news...but I suggest as lesson learned from UAVS, buy the hype, sell off before news are announced as a guarantee way of getting profits.

On a side note: anything could come out between now until that conference call of MVIS to deny or make those information to be more of rumors...that's when the stocks will tank as well. That's a huge risk we all are taking while we are buying the hype.

From a quick read, this is the 'short sale circuit breaker'. Good news for stability going in to tomorrow

* Example: If a stock closed at $100/share on Monday, the ""circuit breaker"" would be triggered if the stock traded at or below $90/share during Tuesday's session. Short-selling would be disallowed until the start of trading on Thursday unless the short-sell price is above the national best bid, i.e. on an uptick.

* Purpose: The stated purpose of this rule is promote market stability and preserve investor confidence by restricting potentially abusive short selling from driving prices farther downward during periods of increased volatility and downward price pressure. Whether or not such rules succeed is a matter of some debate, and the SEC removed similar uptick rules in 2006 because ""they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation.""",2020-05-05

Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular trading hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Secondly, a ROTH analyst believes the target price is going to be $20.50. MARK shares also gained 41.70% in the last 4 weeks. 

But absolutely do your own DD, just in case.
