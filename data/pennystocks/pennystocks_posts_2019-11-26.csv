ALPP is an OTC but appears to be pulling some nice numbers daily now. DFFN is sporadic but decent day today. TRNX also something I've watched since the last pop it had.,2019-11-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e1qhiy/alpp_dffn_and_a_couple_of_other_penny_stocks_to/

11,Spinoff question,e23qwb,LtCrack2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e23qwb/spinoff_question/,1,0,"Two questions actually. Obviously spinoffs aren't guaranteed profit, after all, it is the stock market. Looked up some recent spinoffs, one +15%, one -18%, but they weren't penny stocks.

* Record date-11/29--Spinoff date \~12/5. So would I still get the spinoff if I sold between 11/29-12/5? The article I read makes it seem like you have to hold them until 12/5, but you're only eligible for what you're holding on 11/29.
* Obviously this stock will be opening very low. Saw somewhere on here in a comment that they're expecting them to open at \~.25. Will these go straight to OTC? Using Robinhood so no OTC :/

&gt;With the Taronis Fuels Form 10 filed on September 30, 2019, the record  date has now been established as November 29, 2019. The share  distribution date is expected to be on or before December 5, 2019. **All shareholders of record on November 29th** ***that*** ***hold those shares*** ***until the distribution*** ***is made*** shall be eligible for 5 shares of  Taronis Fuels for each share of the Company owned at that time.",2019-11-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e23qwb/spinoff_question/
