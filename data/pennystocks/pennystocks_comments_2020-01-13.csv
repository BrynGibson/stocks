Couple things to add, anyone even remotely interested in this company should go watch [this video of a lecture by their founder and CSO](https://youtu.be/w_3heP7ol0A) in its entirety, which gives a great summary of their tech platform and science behind their current drug. If you are throwing so much as $50 at this company, watching this video is 30 minutes well spent.

In particular, a few things that are directly relevant to this current trial... [this slide showing both blood naproxen levels on the top graph and inhibition of the inflammation causing COX enzymes on the bottom graph](https://postimg.cc/V0SQSDhW) is extremely important... as OP alluded to, ATB 346 has much less actual naproxen than a comparable dose of straight up naproxen. What this slide comparison tells us is that *the naproxen component alone is not the sole thing responsible for ATB-346's effectiveness*. Both ATB-346 and a higher dose of naproxen markedly and rapidly inhibit COX enzymes, but blood naproxen is much much lower in ATB-346. This means that ATB-346 likely has some additional mechanism of effectiveness beyond just containing a bit of naproxen.

Similarly, [this slide shows how 250 mg of ATB-346 suppresses naproxen not only rapidly, but that this effect remains markedly visible over 24 hours](https://postimg.cc/zLqswJMB)... important during an efficacy trial with once daily dosing.

Lastly, [this slide showing the marked COX inhibition of an extemely low dose of 75mg ATB-346](https://postimg.cc/nXG5hyzt) should inspire **a lot of confidence** in the upcoming trial, as 75mg is *literally half of the lowest dose being assessed in the trial*. While it should be noted that this graph of a 75mg dose does not appear to show a significant (&gt;94%) reduction in COX activity, it is an incredibly strong showing lf the potency of 346 and again, this trial is assessing doses from 2x to ~3.5x as strong as this.


Basically, this (and the info posted by OP), is why I have developed [my current investment thesis](https://postimg.cc/DJxn4Wwn)",2020-01-13
