The study has been provisionally accepted by the Frontiers in Pharmacology Journal it is recent maybe a couple of weeks ago. The study was done in Belgium. **Note** that the dosage was *considerably higher (over 400%)* than what will be administered to humans in the current study so the damage caused by ATB-386 won't likely be significant in humans. The phase 2 study by Antibe - in my opinion will show that the pain relief will be significant. ATB-346 reduces inflammation which contributes to pain.

""ATB-346 significantly reduced the IM-induced increase in muscular  myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and protein levels of interleukin (IL)-6,  IL-1Œ≤ and monocyte chemotactic protein 1; the reduction by naproxen was  less pronounced and only reached significance for MPO activity and IL-6  levels. All treatments significantly reduced the increase in COX-2  activity caused by IM, whereas only GYY4137 significantly reduced the  increase in iNOS activity. Naproxen treatment caused significant  histological damage of intestinal villi.
