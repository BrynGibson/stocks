 I looked into them and I like them, not as a penny stock for quick profits but steady growth. Their biggest hurdle is appealing to under 40.  I'd buy if I was looking for 15-20% a quarter, but I'm seeing closer to 30% on average with my current strategy, so they while likely safer money, are slower money than I'm looking for.

The promotions of this scale are commonly called ""mailers"" because they are slow, and often use real, beautiful printed snail mail brochures along with the internet - This is from a March advertisement and I bet I can find more - ""has been paid by International Battery Metals one hundred and ninety thousand US dollars for this article and certain banner ads."" It is a huge promotional campaign being ""blasted"" everywhere online and the company is behind it. There is no real lithium extraction. They will never be the king. It is a story and overall a scam although everything appears not so on the surface. They will never even be around in 1-2years. These are facts coming from 10-year trader (myself). I am not saying I haven't made tons of money on these types of plays - just know what you're trading. i encourage you to save this post. read the disclaimers of these articles, what do you think about it, seems sort of pump and dumpish cause of the promotional campaign. I've still made $500 dollars off of it just today but doesn't seem like a good long time investment
