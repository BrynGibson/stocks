By comparing txb2 through various existing studies on naproxen this puts our drug at a level matching at least 880mg daily naproxen in terms of cox suppression. once they publish in their journal and release the detailed data we can make further evaluations and be able to tell for certain what the outcome of the next trial should be.

However at this point based on this we should show at least non inferiority to naproxen which is a 100% win. If they can show a higher reduction in womac again such as the one in 2A this literally changes the whole world in regards to NSAID therapy and its possibilities. If they meet the same level and officially have non inferiority to naproxen it is still a huge win as they've almost completely eliminated side effects. 

If they get that WOMAC of 7 though at 250mg or even a womac of 5 or 6.... my God. This drug would change the world. Serious.",2018-07-03

73,superstunt3,e1yufll,/r/pennystocks/comments/8vrzu9/atbpf_atev_antibe_therapeutics_releases_secondary/e1yufll/,1,"There's clear evidence that the drug works and will be gamechanging if everything works out. But just look at the MD&amp;A and you will find all of the risks (they list 30+) involved with this company. One of the major concerns is the lack of diversification involving their drug pipeline. Their attempt to diversify with citagenix hasn't fully taken shape yet so they are exposed to massive risk if their H2s design falls short. I'm very optimistic about ATE but, with market weakness, a $.40 share price can be justified.",2018-07-03

OTC Markets or Nasdaq, etc. If you are not about to spend a lot of money, then yahoo finance, OTC/Nasdaq Website, or any of the tools provided by the brokerage should be fine. Googling the stocks you find off of those tools is really good too. Set the timeline to the last week or month and look at the recent news. ",2018-07-03
77,DesignPrime,e2dya1k,/r/pennystocks/comments/8vrzu9/atbpf_atev_antibe_therapeutics_releases_secondary/e2dya1k/,1,I think it just needs to show similar effects to naproxen without the side effect and it will be FDA approved. Just having GI issues go away is a huge win.,2018-07-03
