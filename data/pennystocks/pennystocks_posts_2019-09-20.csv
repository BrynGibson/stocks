Midland-based exploration and production company that is engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production activities. Primary drilling operations target the Central Basin Platform in Andrews County and Gaines County, Texas and the Delaware Basin in Reeves County and Culberson County, Texas, all of which are part of the Permian Basin.

**Details:**

As of December 31, 2018, Ring increased its proved reserves to approximately 36.6 million BOE (barrel of oil equivalent), all of which relate to its properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas.

Of those reserves, 61% of the proved reserves are classified as proved developed producing, 6% are classified as proved developed non-producing, and 33% are classified as proved undeveloped.

As of December 31, 2018, Ring owned interests in a total of 19,432 gross (17,408 net) developed acres and 87,771 gross (58,620 net) undeveloped acres in Andrews and Gaines Counties, Texas. In these counties, the Company has 62 identified proven vertical drilling locations and 19 identified proven horizontal locations based on the reserve reports as of December 31, 2018, and an additional 563 potential vertical drilling locations based on 10-acre downspacing and 769 potential horizontal drilling locations based on 6 wells per section or 106 acres per well.

Also as of December 31, 2018, Ring owned interests in a total of 19,323 gross (19,138 net) developed acres and 896 gross (860 net) undeveloped acres in Culberson and Reeves Counties, Texas. In these counties, the Company has 39 identified proven vertical drilling locations and identified proven horizontal locations based on the reserve reports as of December 31, 2018 and an additional 430 potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing.

Ring intends to grow its reserves and production through development, drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet the Company’s strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves.

**Company's ""proven and simple"" Growth Strategy**

Arena Resources was formed in 2001 by Tim Rochford and Stan McCabe with a focus of growing production and reserves organically and via acquisition.

It sold in July 2010 for $1.6BN.

Ring’s management team desires to execute a similar growth strategy and I believe management can and will pull it off. The company plans to be cash flow neutral by the end of 2019. So far that is panning out. With recent developments, they'll more than likely be positive at EOY. Upper management must feel the same way because the CFO just doubled his position. If you know anything about CFO's, they usually know their numbers.

**Business Details:**

2018 EOY Sales: $120,065,361

2017 EOY Sales: $66,699,700

1 Year Sales Growth: 80%

2013 EOY Sales: $10,315,701

Average Annual Sales Growth Since 2013: 177%

Average Annual EPS Growth Since 2013: 49%

Tangible Assets: $567,065,659

Total Liabilities: $104,466,229

Tangible Book Value: $462,599,430

My Estimated True Book Value: &lt;$650m

Net Income: $8,999,760

Estimated 1 Year Future Net Income: $13-17m

2018 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities: $70,357,321

2013 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities: $8,116,408

Current Market Cap: x &lt; $115m

To me, this is a no brainer. An easy, low-risk winner. 7% position in our current portfolio with plans to double on any large drops of 10% or greater.

Good luck everybody!

ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 20, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AVRA Medical Robotics, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCQB: AVMR), an emerging company which is building a fully autonomous medical robotic system through the use of new technologies combining artificial intelligence, machine learning and proprietary software, announced today it has appointed Dr. Vipul Patel to Chair its Medical Advisory Board and Dr. Eytan Pollak to Chair the Scientific Advisory Board, effective immediately.  


Barry F. Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, “I am extremely pleased to have these two distinguished doctors join the AVRA team. Dr. Patel and Dr. Pollak are both world renowned figures in their respective industries – Dr. Patel is one of the most robotic-experienced medical professionals in the world and Dr. Pollak is one of the most highly regarded scientists with a deep knowledge and expertise in control systems, robotics and simulation, as well as artificial intelligence applications. I believe Dr. Patel and Dr. Pollak will bring a plethora of knowledge and experience to assist AVRA in our mission of commercializing a fully autonomous medical robotic system.”

Dr. Vipul Patel is the founder and Medical Director of the Florida Hospital Global Robotics Institute, founder and Vice President of the Society of Robotic Surgery, and founder and Editor Emeritus of The Journal of Robotic Surgery.

As of February 2018, he performed his 11,000th robotic-assisted prostatectomy and is now nearing his 13,000th procedure. The large volume of prostatectomies he has performed has enabled him to amass a large amount of statistical evidence regarding the efficacy of robotic techniques which has been used in developing and refining techniques. Patel credits the use of robotic assisted surgery with helping surgeons achieve better surgical outcomes with the ""trifecta"" of cancer control, continence and sexual function. In the course of his career, Dr. Patel has led and participated in studies that have resulted in developing improved outcomes for robotic surgery and urologic treatments.

Dr. Eytan Pollak received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Technion-I.I.T. (Haifa, Israel) and his Ph.D. from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. He has 30 years of experience in managing research and development programs, holds several patents, and has published papers in Control Systems, Robotics, Distributed Flight and Ground Simulations/Simulators, Embedded Systems, and Cyber Physical Systems. He served as an M&amp;S Technology Manager, IRAD Technical Director and Principal Investigator at Lockheed Martin. He is currently a research professor at the UCF School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and he is also the Director of Strategic Technologies at L3Harris Technologies Communications Link Simulation &amp; Training.",2019-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d6yf2t/avmr_avra_medical_robotics_appoints_two_world/

2nd drop: $TEUM just released $40M worth of shares today priced at 1.75 and 2.25
3rd drop (happened at same time as 2nd drop): All tech stocks are taking a dip today.

Disclaimer: I am invested into $TEUM and I am down money.  Also, $TEUM is rated poorly by private analysts and highly by public analysts.

However, even if you don't believe in the long term hype of this stock, it will definitely bounce back from it's current price, which is near the 52 week low.

If you arent already invested like me, then it is a good time to buy.


Be careful about long term bets with this company though. They are very chaotic in share price.  There is lots of money to be made or lost in the chaos.",2019-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d6y63i/teum_took_a_big_hit_in_share_price_likely_going/
