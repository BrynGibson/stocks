1,"Watchlist for 5/2: BIEL, AXXA, UHLN, IFXY",8gddkz,dirtywiggles,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gddkz/watchlist_for_52_biel_axxa_uhln_ifxy/,18,5,"

BIEL has been a good little runner now for some time going on news of an upcoming FDA review for a product. Running as it is gaining more attention. By far the most stable thing in this wild time. Might hold it for a long time tomorrow after evaluating it later. 

AXXA is the little engine that could that breaks all laws and support. I think we see yet another morning spike but that is just me. I thought it would die mid day yesterday but no why would it. Will give you dip buys for sure tomorrow. Not as volatile as it was but still a great one to play with. 

UHLN I expect a morning spike again and it will give us a little run in the morning but otherwise it may be dead. We will see mid day. 

IFXY has been a nice runner and overnight player for a while. This is a major determining day of will it continue to run or did it top out. The answer we find tomorrow but it will have something to give us.

I expected a bit of a pull back yesterday, but based on how well it held up and how the selling slowed down in the afternoon, I would not be surprised at all to see it continue to run again today. Seems to fit the pattern on the chart as well. We'll see what happens!",2018-05-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8gh8j9/lvvv_again/
4,Deveron UAS Connects SOAR with the John Deere Operations Center,8ggvs7,Cosmokramer111,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ggvs7/deveron_uas_connects_soar_with_the_john_deere/,2,0,"TORONTO, May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Deveron UAS Corp. (CSE:DVR) (“Deveron” or the “Company”), a leading drone data services company for farming, is pleased to announce that it has completed integration with the John Deere Operations Center. This user enabled connection gives Operations Center users direct access to Deveron’s drone data order management platform, SOAR.  This API integration significantly increases the ease for users of the Operations Center to acquire ultra-high-resolution drone data by ordering flights for their farms.

Operations Center users can now connect their accounts to Deveron to:

Import field boundaries from the Operations Center to organize fields for drone flights
Order on-demand ultra-high-resolution drone imagery for their farms for a variety of sensors
Receive processed and/or raw data to drive improved decision making during the growing season
Users can now place orders for in-season drone imagery throughout the farming season whether it be for a single, on-demand flight or a collection of scheduled flights to track changes through the season.  In 2017, Deveron completed over 2,200 flights for its customers and will be looking forward to expanding its capacity to Operations Center users.

“We are extremely thrilled to be able to offer Deveron’s on-demand drone data service to John Deere’s Operations Center users,” commented Deveron’s President &amp; CEO, David MacMillan.  “Deveron’s network of trained drone pilots, industry leading drones and sensors provides a scalable and economic way for farmers to get drone data when they need it in the 2018 growing season and beyond.  As we continue to expand our drone fleet in North America, we look forward to growing our user base and offering farmers a solution that allows them to focus on farming, not flying drones and processing data.”",2018-05-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8ggvs7/deveron_uas_connects_soar_with_the_john_deere/

This is the second instance of them doing so (gold mining company before this one) 

They produce fake news stories, press releases, and merger announcements until they can pump the stock and then sell off all stock owned by the managing team until crash. They then abandon it for new companies. They always incorporate in countries that do no extradite to the USA to avoid fraud charges.
