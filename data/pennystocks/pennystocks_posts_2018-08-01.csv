ATLANTA, July 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incumaker, Inc. (OTC Pink: QMKR) is providing this  shareholder update on the progress of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with uBid Holdings Inc. (“UBID”). As previously announced, UBID agreed to merge with and into Incumaker and have Incumaker be the surviving corporation. Under this Alternative Public Offering, or “APO” transaction, shareholders of UBID will own 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the newly combined company.  The Company will seek to change its name to “uBid Holdings Inc.” as well as its ticker symbol post-merger to better reflect the company’s new technology related business model.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, UBID’s current officers and directors would become the officers and directors of the newly combined company.  


Under the initial terms of the prior Agreement and Plan of Merger, Incumaker and UBID were to close the merger by May 31, 2018, which was extended to July 31, 2018. The closing of the transaction is subject to UBID completing the acquisition of Sky Auction and having the financing to consummate a second acquisition, and other customary conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies.

Ketan Thakker, UBID’s Chief Executive Officer, stated: “We are disappointed that that the merger timeline was not met but the audits have been more complex than expected.  We are pleased to announce, however, that as of July 31st, these audits have been completed. The completion of these PCOAB audits along with Incumaker currently being PCOAB audited are necessary steps to up-list to the OTCQB market, which we intend to do.”

“We remain excited about the planned merger and our focus continues to be taking the necessary steps to close the contemplated transaction,” Both companies have agreed to mutually extend the Merger timeline. We are working daily to complete the needed steps to consummate this merger as soon as possible.” Darren Bankston, CEO of Incumaker, commented.

the New Description 

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/RSHN/profile




from the New description we can read "" 

"" RushNet will also own CBD production facilities as part of its joint venture."" 



i have posted a similar DD under the Tittle : 

""is RSHN the Jackpot $$?( MUST READ DD) &gt;&gt;&gt; ""


https://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=141431742 

and all My DD was about if RSHN will produce industrial Hemp(for CBD production) to serve all POTN products and the whole market !!! 


and the answer came today in a much bigger way than i anticipated because RSHN also own CBD production facilities as part of its joint venture. 

we are talking about a HUGE play here especially with the HEMP legalization that is happening just now in USA !! 

RSHN will be right in it as CBD production is all about industrial HEMP !!! 

and POTN is already buying imported HEMP !!! so by having CBD production in RSHN POTN will reduce dramatically its production costs and will register higher profits !!! 

and of course RSHN will sell them all the CBD they need !!!! 


the more POTN will make $$$ the more RSHN will do too $$$ 


PENNIES PENNIES coming here !!!
