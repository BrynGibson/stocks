0,0.0001 to 0.0050 stocks Question.,89vwbt,Aaronacorona,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/89vwbt/00001_to_00050_stocks_question/,1,18,"Hi,

I was wondering what is the negatives of buying these stocks. I found a few stocks in this price range where it always pops back 100% once it hits these lows?

Obviously just going to put a few 100 bucks and won't break the piggy bank investing in these companies. 

I read that sometimes you can't sell or they could go bankrupt. Or it could be diluted  (not sure what that means)

Please provide me with some insight.

Thanks

12,Is Block One Capital BKPPF Making Progress?,8a11nb,Mattp19200,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8a11nb/is_block_one_capital_bkppf_making_progress/,7,2,I think If there is a company that people should be getting familiar with it's Block One Capital (BKPPF). They work in the 3 different markets but one of these markets has captured my attention and that is the real estate side of their company. Let me explain. In midst of the crypto craze what I have taken from it is the ability to get acclimated to is blockchain technology which is simply a verifiable tracking system that can provide immediate answers. What Block One is doing within the real estate world is using the blockchain to help others get approved for mortgages in half the time it would usually take. If proven to be valuable this kind of progression can cause serious revenue for the company as well a create more opportunities for investors who wish to get involved.,2018-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8a11nb/is_block_one_capital_bkppf_making_progress/
