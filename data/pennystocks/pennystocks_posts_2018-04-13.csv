Lots of hype and excitement around the annual report being released on Monday for UCPA. $50m annual revenue last year, estimates place this year closer to $60m - float is under $2.5m and total cap is around $10m. 

HCEI on the other hand had it's first filing in two years a few months back and has been quiet ever since, but volume picked up today along with an L2 shift. Looks like it may finally be time this one blows the top off. ",2018-04-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8c1kh5/ucpa_hcei/

Did not disappoint just wish I set a limit above .0089. My ANDI pick was disastrous where I thought it would recover in the morning. Still have a decent batting percentage. 

SSOF is an example of an OTC multuday breakout that still wants to run and could be a good long. 

FUSZ is another multiday breakout that is recovering back to its highs slowly and could be a good long. 

DPW had some volatility and solid gains all day yesterday. Now I think it could be a slow short to do. ",2018-04-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8c0azc/stocks_to_watch_for_413_celz_ssof_fusz_dpw/
