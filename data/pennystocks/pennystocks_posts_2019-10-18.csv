It’s been consolidating for a few days.

It’s on a downward trend, but it has had its first Green Day in about 2 weeks and has shown similar behavior in the past before spiking.

What do you think? Does what I’m saying make sense from an analytical point of view? Or am I a total noob?",2019-10-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/djjqlx/new_trader_here_bought_some_hcr_do_you_like_the/

With momentum from a major award yesterday at the Cologne Film Festival, ""Easy Love"" - the acclaimed German documentary from director Tamer Jandali - will target the 2020 Oscars race with a USA theatrical release on Jan. 31, 2020 from indie distributor Hannover House, Inc. (OTC: HHSE). The film originally premiered at the Berlinale Perspective Deutches Kino in February, and is opening in German cinemas today. The USA theatrical release will initially target New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, with documentary, foreign film and pop culture audiences as the targets. 

""We had considered a Dec. 13 opening in the USA,"" said Hannover House C.E.O. Eric Parkinson. ""But the screen competition from holiday releases and awards titles would have limited the length of the film's launch and may have impeded our ability to implement bulk sales promotions. Moving the release into late January will deliver improved market conditions and enable the film to be expanded as needed throughout February and March.""

""Easy Love"" chronicles the lives and sexual exploits of a group of 25-to-45 year olds in Germany, as they struggle to find substantive happiness from sometimes superficial romances. The film captures the emotions and drama of these relationships up close and builds an effective empathic bond with audiences. At Berlinale, the post-screening Q&amp;A revealed that many in the audience did not realize that the film was a documentary and that it was presenting real-life moments between the subjects. 

""The intensity and authenticity of the scenes is unsurpassed in world cinema,"" said Parkinson. ""As a documentary, in German, with explicit sexual content, there are legitimate reasons to question the commercial viability of 'Easy Love.'   But within minutes, the audience is mesmerized and fully commited to the romantic plights of these engaging subjects,"" he concluded. 

Hannover House, Inc. is a multi-faceted media company involved with the production and distribution of independent cinema products. Originally launched in 1993 in California, the company merged with Target Development Group, Inc. in 2009 and became a Wyoming Corporation.  Hannover House, Inc. has released over forty feature films to theatres in the past nine years, and over five-hundred titles in total to the DVD and home video markets.  Notable releases include ""TWELVE"" - a thriller from director Joel Schumacher starring Emma Roberts and Curtis ""50-Cent"" Jackson and the family film favorite ""GRAND CHAMPION"" starring Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts.  Popular selling books from the company's publishing label include the # 1 Amazon best seller, ""Blood Money &amp; Power: How LBJ Killed JFK"" (2003) from author Barr McClellan, and the fiction best-seller ""Quietus"" from author Vivian Schilling.  The company has also organized a large group of independent distributors and film libraries to collectively participate in the launch a major video-on-demand streaming service branded under ""MyFlix"" ([www.MyFlix.com](http://www.myflix.com/)).",2019-10-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/djsioc/hhse_hannover_house_eyes_2020_oscar_run_for/
