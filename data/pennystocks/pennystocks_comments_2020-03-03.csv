Thanks for the link though, helped me understand a little more.

But same question as above, if stocks are merged to form more valuable shares, who loses the stock? 

For example, if there are 10 stocks at $1 each - total valuation at $10. Only 2 people hold stocks, 5 each - so $5 valuation for each guy. 

And say maybe the company decides to have 5 stocks only at $2 each. Does each person lose 2.5 stock and have 2.5 stock remaining while maintaining their valuation at $5/person?",2020-03-03

185,OneDent,fjcuq2c,/r/pennystocks/comments/fct2uc/which_strategy_do_you_guys_recommand_for_a/fjcuq2c/,1,"Still very very new to investing, but you should probably find a good brokerage (probably not Robinhood) and buy a good index fund/invest in a solid company that you know is a solid company (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) through them. While your money is appreciating, research other companies and learn how things work and then start making ‚Äúriskier‚Äù investments. 

Now am I doing any of that? Absolutely not. In fact I‚Äôm actually doing the opposite. But I‚Äôm investing less than $200 and I‚Äôm not afraid to lose the money I‚Äôve put into the stock market. Do your research and get multiple opinions. I YOLO‚Äôd my first investments and so far I haven‚Äôt lost everything. But I based those investments off of some digging (granted not nearly the amount of research that most people do when they‚Äôre picking stocks) and I was obviously prepared to take a massive chance on the companies in which I‚Äôve invested. 

So you can either do things the smart way or the WSB/YOLO way and probably have to choke back tears as you check the market and see red (but also don‚Äôt check it like every hour unless you‚Äôre a masochist like myself because you‚Äôll go crazy knowing you just spent $XX on X company and now that $XX is worth only $X).",2020-03-03

IBIO was a .30 cent stock a month ago. The conronavirus came and predators jumped at the opportunity to spread hype. The hype came, predators made a lot of money, and people late to the ride are now holding bags and angry that it isn't going up anymore. Show me some research on why IBIO should be worth more than the .30 it was a month ago that isn't just fear of the CV. What are they working on? What big news have that released that they share value should be up 300% in a short time? If that news was so valid why is the price now crashing?

700,jwg529,fjey1cj,/r/pennystocks/comments/fd3b30/should_i_sell_ino/fjey1cj/,2,It‚Äôs all luck. Robinhood has had INO as a 100% buy for a few weeks so I have had my eye on it. I watched it all day sit around $5.15 and around 2:30 it had a major pop. I decided to jump in and go for the ride. I was going to sell before close but it just kept going up and up so I figured I‚Äôd hold overnight to see what happens tomorrow. INO is not one of the stocks I‚Äôve seen pumped on the penny stock subs so my guess is the pumps will start tomorrow. My word of advice is only play with money you can afford to lose. And if you are playing around with penny stocks that you see get a lot of attention on Reddit it‚Äôs safe to assume they are already near the top and if you are going to get on don‚Äôt say on long. Look at charts for most penny stocks and you will see a history of them failing down and down. So if there isn‚Äôt a good reason for them to go up it‚Äôs safe to assume people are just pumping the stock for a quick profit attempt. INO came out with news that they will have a vax trial in April so that was worthy news for the jump it had today.,2020-03-03

Don't be afraid to lose money to decrease potential losses, a good rule of thumb is to not go below -10%, but I will sometimes let it get to -15% before I cut my losses. Sometimes it pays off to wait for a bounce up, but most of the time you get stuck holding bags.

I would put down 100% of your holdings into one stock until you get $750, then divide it up. If you get 20% rise on 250 that's 50$. I know people will say its a bad idea, but honestly if you only put 50$ on a stock you won't care enough to watch it closely, put 20k on a stock and you watch it like a fucking eagle. Try to keep your momentum and snowball your funds to 25k as fast as possible to get unlimited day trades, then reduce your puts to 100$ and work on getting constant 5% gains

Be careful holding overnight, I usually try to sell unless I see steady momentum in AH, and lots of positive comments online. Try to use your 3 day trades p/wk carefully, and don't be afraid of accepting a 10-20$ gain.

If you do well and get 50-60K don't be greedy, don't get lax about watching your charts and research. I once put 20k on a stock before a flight and when I landed I lost 2k, most expensive flight I've ever taken. 

This is my #1 tip: Don't trust the companies and don't trust users on this site, they are all here to steal money from each other, and your job is to steal their money better. Be extremely careful of pumpers, most of my good finds come from posts with 1 like or comment in the new section.
