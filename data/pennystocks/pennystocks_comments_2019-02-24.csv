Both of these diseases can pose a serious threat to native shrimp  populations but are not harmful to humans.

At the time of the reverse split (that morning) no matter how many shares you have there value is the same . Price should rise for 5 - 15 minutes ( if it doesn‚Äôt do all of it at premarket)Then there will be a sell off . When the reverse splits bring the stock up to 3-5$ the sell off is about a third ( I‚Äôve never seen one this low) 
Then it bounces about 25 percent of the drop(usually)
 That first 5-15 minutes is the opportunity to sell your shares and come out ahead or as little loss as possible 
I usually don‚Äôt have enough shares after the split 
The risky play is to buy back at the bounce and sell those shares at the peak. Say that morning it goes to .60 cents then falls to 25 cents, bounces back to 35 cents. That a 10 cent bounce there‚Äôs profit to be made

There are many indoor shrimp farms producing 90% success.  I don't know why SHMP could not get beyond much more than 50%, hence their search for something different.  

Using the bioflock method (organic), you need to monitor the bacteria level. If it gets too low, the levels of shrimp poo and ammonia gets to high and harvest levels drop. This is why most growers do not change the water after each harvest.  They want to keep the bacteria level up. This bacteria is not a detriment to the shrimp. ..it's their friend, and eventually their food supplement. 

SHMP's idea is to filter the water and process it through their proprietary system for a more sterile environment, killing all the bacteria and viruses (good and bad).

Both systems are a closed loop,  meaning the water is reused. This is unlike shrimp farms found along coastal areas,  which circulates their tanks with fresh sea water. This is the method used in Asia, leading to contaminated shrimp. 

Shrimp farming has caught my interest about attempting this myself.  I wish SHMP would give more details about their system but maybe more will come in the next week. 

I do own shares and am in the red...$0.59 average.

As for ""shit"" in the shrimp,  using either method above, these shrimp are so clean the vein does not need to be removed.  (Yes, I know you were writing about contaminates.)
