This statement is one of the cardinal beliefs held by most technicians. It first came to my attention in the late 1970s when I read Joe Granville's book New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Maximum Profit, where he wrote “stocks do not rise in price unless demand exceeds supply. Demand is measured in volume and thus volume must precede price.” (Tom Aspray, Forbes magazine) CRYO averaged about 10,000 shares a day in March. In the last 3 trading days is has averaged 49,648 shares per day. Volume always precedes price. This stock is going higher.
Besides the technical trading, the fundamentals are getting better daily. The international business is growing fast. China is expanding and new licensees coming on soon in Thailand, India, Singapore and Mexico. Stem cells are the future of medicine and even if our FDA moves slow, the rest of the world is not. I am a long term holder of this stock but there is probably a nice trade in it also for those so inclined.
