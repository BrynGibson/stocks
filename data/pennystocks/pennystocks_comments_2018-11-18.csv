But the rest of my life, which is what you would call ""real life"" is much different.

I could be the Rock, Snoop Dogg, Joe Rogan, or another famous cannabis activist trying to get regular people into a penny stock before it takes off.

I could be a politician in power who gives a green light or the red light to any of these companies.

I could be an expert psychologist on the effects of cannabis, and my opinion would matter more than others.

I could be a life long student working on my ph.d studying every aspect of cannabis and health.

I could be the agent or publicist for a really big star, or a billionaire Saudi Prince prepared to tell them where to invest all of their money.

Or I could just be a nobody.

That's half the fun. One should really ask themselves, how crazy does one have to be to invest everything in three penny stock companies and feel very confident about the Outlook regardless of what happens?

Because as I said in a different post, if any one of these three stocks take off, not only am I rich but I am an ""expert"" at Investments overnight.

And no matter what happens, the one thing I care about is smart people who are willing to take a chance, winning for once in their life.

when you spend a lot of time on the computer, hanging out on forums such as Reddit, you are teased and treated like lesser of a human because you don't fit in. I like to see those people win sometimes. 

I was once screwed over really bad by the highly educated system of people, who simply did not want to help me when I needed help. 

The best revenge I can think of is to beat them at their own game, and help others like myself win. A piece of paper from an institution does not dictate who deserves to be respected in the world. I strongly believe people should be treated as individuals instead of numbers and beating the ""institution"" at their own game is the only fair and ethical way to do it.

1) make a lot of money 2) open up multiple businesses 3) only hire people without post-secondary education 4) destroy your competition 5) destroy the post-secondary system 6) work everyday helping people, until the day you die. 

Those are the kinds of people I like to align myself with ;)",2018-11-18

People have very short-term memories when it comes to DOS attacks. What would happen if millions of Russian or Chinese or Saudi or American bots decided to focus a month-long attack on a country's banking infrastructure?

It would literally crumble an economy. 

Even today, the stock market is losing billions of dollars in losses and Bitcoin has taking huge cuts. Do you know how many people are losing money because of it? Do you know how many jobs are lost because of it? This is a economic crisis that people are ignoring.

Nanocap stocks are the real penny stocks. PXS, GLBS, DCIX are nanocap size stocks. The size, the share float, the price volatility, poor fundamentals, not following exchange listing rules, dilution, toxic securities structure, etc. I tell that price has less to do for a stock to be called penny stock. I do not deny price, but other more dominant inherent fundamental and technical features make a stock a penny stock.

I do not separate shipping stocks by container and tankers. I go with the whole sector/industry stocks that are moving intact.

So these are just a few things I watch in stocks.

I already made a third weekly video recap with $PXS and I stated price levels I am watching for the upcoming week for $PXS. To summarize it will fade away with few possible spikes to the upside, but no true rise in price and volume. ",2018-11-18
