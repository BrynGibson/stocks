The site allows you to embed linked images on websites and the images themselves are not downloadable or screenshot-able. I could see why some brands and photographers would find interest in this.

The mockups for the ads in images on their site show a lower third transparent overlay on an image. So a photographer that wants to monetize an image (that can be hosted on fotofy, and subsequently shared by whomever) can receive ad revenue. I imagine more artistic photographers won’t want to monetize that way. But imagine a picture of an iconic tourist location, nothing special. But the photographer can choose to monetize it since they might not care about the artistic integrity of it but see it as a widely shareable image that they can profit from.

That’s kind of what I saw, but I didn’t dive too deep. I’m also one of the people who jumped TTCM and took my profit and invested it here. TTCM proof of concept looks garbage IMO. Everything I’ve found on inage protect and fotofy looks legit and actually works. Big caveat from me is that I’m new to penny stocks and don’t know too well how to read financials for DD.

It’s not about the website and copyright infringement because that’s what the Image Protect business model was. What FOTOFY does is track use on images and offerers revenue on legitimate and none legitimate uses. Where this can be useful is for example the absolutely massive amounts on stolen images used on amazon/eBay or other websites selling products. The amount of image fraud used on websites like amazon is astronomical. There are large Facebook groups dedicated towards solving the issue of stolen product images being used my fraudulent sellers. Honestly I believe the long term value of a business like this could provide strategic partnerships with other companies like this to help crack down on these issues and help provide a better seller vetting program for Amazon/EBay. Quality control will come and FOTOFY will be spearheading the movement.,2019-07-31
