I started studying penny stocks recently. I appreciate if you can help me in the following financial ratios calculations, I use yahoo finance and sometimes SEC to find financial numbers but sometimes I am confused:

1.Operating Cash Flow Ratio: where do I find the cash flow from operations, is it the same as ""total cashflow from operating activities""?

2. Receivables Turnover Ratio: Accounts receivables is the same as ""net receivables"" which is listed on the Yahoo balance sheet?

3. Payables Turnover Ratio: How do I calculate ""purchases"" and where do I find the numbers for them?

4. Fixed Asset Turnover: How do I calculate it properly, where can I find the proper numbers and what is the procedures in using these numbers to calculate the result?

5.P/E: earnings per share is the net income on the  income statement divided by the outstanding shares numbers ( which is listed on Yahoo's statistics tab?) ?

I would appreciate your help greatly guys, also is there a way these financial ratios can be calculated automatically for me instead of constantly going through long work to get them?

Thank you.",2019-08-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cqxlck/fa_calculations_questions/

(AABB), through its wholly owned subsidiary Asia Metals Inc., recently began its 2019 Phase II Drill Program in close proximity to the Company's Guerrero Gold Belt (GGB) mine in Mexico to further delineate the known historical and new gold vein structures. The $4M Phase II Program estimates that more than 40 drill holes and over 20,000 (m) of drilling will be completed.   

In January of this year, the Company's management and technical team reported the successful drill results from the Phase I Program.  The highlights of the drill results revealed high grade gold mineralization that attested the mine's historical production to date. The most significant gold value intersections were 3.1 meters (m) graded at 10.9 grams per ton (g/t), 4.8 meters (m) graded at 8.7 grams per ton (g/t) and 14.2 meters (m) graded at 5.7 grams per ton (g/t).

At the same time that AABB is expanding its gold mining operations, Goldman Sachs has published an upgrade to its 2019 gold forecast stating that prices have risen to six-year highs and will climb to $1,600 an ounce over the next six months.
