1,Boots-n-Bell,dtg189v,/r/pennystocks/comments/7twwtc/lgbs/dtg189v/,1,Well six months ago it ran to .004 just on the rumor of this acquisition. So I would say that is the base but from there this could really run wild depending on the company the Oil company. I would not be shocked with a run to a penny then from there who knows how high we could go. I love the situation this stock is in with Oil being up and a Oil company taking over the ticker most likely. This week news will determine everything. ,2018-01-30
2,Boots-n-Bell,dtg218t,/r/pennystocks/comments/7twwtc/lgbs/dtg218t/,1,Exxon did release they plan to spend $5 Billion in the United States this year on new acquisitions today. I mean that’s a far stretch they have interest in this company once we acquire ours. But crazier things have happened. The timing is good ,2018-01-30
