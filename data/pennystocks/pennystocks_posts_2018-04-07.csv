4,Any penny stocks that people are planning to hold for years? I'm sick of day trading. Want to invest a bit in a few different ways and not have to deal with it every day.,8afidu,Jumbuck_Tuckerbag,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8afidu/any_penny_stocks_that_people_are_planning_to_hold/,2,0,[removed],2018-04-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8afidu/any_penny_stocks_that_people_are_planning_to_hold/
5,"*****Why I Picked Longfin at $9.00, and Why I Sold $20******",8am414,stockenthusiast,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8am414/why_i_picked_longfin_at_900_and_why_i_sold_20/,7,12,"Proof is in the link below.    Longfin went to $140 due to a variety of factors. Bitcoin was just starting to go parabolic, and the news media was starting to compare crypto to the tech bubble. Plus, Longfin represented crypto's entrance into the sector of international trade, Longfin being in the business trade finance. The final factor that caused the parabolic interday move was that longfin had very few shares available to the public, only 10 million, many already held. Dow was also making new all time highs
It was also a recent ipo, so the market still hadn't discovered its price yet. The reason I said go big on LFIN though, was very simple. The price fluctuations were extreme, and when it retraced the full move, how much lower could it have gone? It was due for at least one more quick uptick. Also, Russel 2000 delisted the company due to lack of available shares!!!!!!!! Once it retraced the full move, it was like hitting 77777's on a slot machine. I sold $20 because of the SEC charges being filed, or else I would have held
