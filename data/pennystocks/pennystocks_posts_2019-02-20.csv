LeafyWell, PYTG's Subsidiary, Announces To-date 1st Quarter Revenues 2019 Expected to Surpass 2018 Final-Quarter Sales.

WESTON, Florida, Feb. 20, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- During the final quarter of 2018, Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK: PYTG) (PYTG) acquired NxGen Brands, LLC and became the proud owner of LeafyWell (LeafyWell.com), and shortly thereafter announced the finalization of a contractual agreement to provide custom cannabidiol (CBD)-product formulations to Emergent Health, Corp., including the first product of its kind for both companies consisting of an ingredient trifecta designed to aid in sleep, anxiety, and mood: CBD, Melatonin, and GABA. Additionally, during the final quarter of 2018, PYTG announced the execution of a binding letter of intent to acquire Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC. – a private Florida-based company specializing in health and wellness supplements.

During the same quarter, PYTG, by way of LeafyWell (LeafyWell.com), officially launched a full line of CBD-infused pet treats in addition to their already-established line of hemp-based CBD-infused supplements such as tinctures/oils, creams, lotions, edible gummies, available at both wholesale and retail levels. CBD should be considered a notable discussion topic in the medical community, the research community, and the patient community. CBD research has provided evidentiary findings demonstrating its potentially beneficial symptomatic relief for vast range of ailments, including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, chronic pain, and muscular dystrophy, among others.

PYTG announces today that revenues of LeafyWell (LeafyWell.com) products online, wholesale, distributors, formulating, and private labeling, to date in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 alone, are expected to officially surpass all revenues during the final calendar-year quarter of 2018. Carlos Hurtado, CEO of PYTG, stated, ""We are enthused with the rising success of LeafyWell branded products and the performance of PYTG as a whole. We are certainly pleased to remark on this record-breaking news for LeafyWell and we are looking forward to what is to come for the following fiscal-year quarters. All of us at PYTG are hard at work including our phenomenal Board of Advisors who are guiding us through patient-based needs and related product formulations.""

The Board of Advisors for PYTG includes currently-practicing medical professionals such as board-certified cardiologist and board-certified internal medicine physician, Dr. Mark Sabbota, family medicine specialist, Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD, Dr. David M. Feldbaum MD, FACS, certified in vascular surgery by the American Board of Surgery, Dr. Javier J. Canasi, with a specialization in internal medicine who is advocate of alternative medicine including the inclusion of both hemp-based CBD products, marijuana-based CBD, and medicinal marijuana, when appropriate for the particular medical condition that ails some patients, and in addition to other industry-specific board members.

Mr. Hurtado, continues to explain, ""We anticipate that our current shareholders will be equally elated to learn the news that we are on target to successfully surpass our final-quarter 2018 revenues of our CBD hemp-derived supplements, including those manufactured by LeafyWell, solely during this short period of time in 2019. As a company, we expect to continue to move forward on many fronts, and we expect that this news is just the tip of the iceberg of what is ahead in a big way."" In fact this week, we made the news in Peoria, Illinois where specialty retailers are currently selling a wide variety of our CBD product line LeafyWell, and pet CBD treats is now sold. This is excellent publicity on all levels for LeafyWell, with more to come.""

&amp;#x200B;

PHOENIX, Feb. 20, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uptick Newswire Stock Day Podcast welcomed Premier Biomedical, Inc. (BIEI), a research-based publicly traded company that intends to discover and develop medical treatments for a wide range of diseases in humans. President and CEO, William A. Hartman, joined Stock Day host Everett Jolly.  


Jolly began the interview by asking Hartman to give an update to listeners about the Company’s current projects. Hartman explained the Company was previously strictly a R&amp;D based business. This went well for the Company, they were forced to put their very successful projects, including a cure for PTSD as well as an anti-breast cancer drug on the shelf and morph the company into developing and marketing a revenue-producing series of hemp oil/CBD topical pain-relieving products.

To explain the Company’s current position, Hartman shared a letter with listeners that the company sent out recently to 29 of its Directors, Officers, and sales force. Hartman also stated that the letter would soon be sent out to the company’s stockholders and its e-mail distribution list.

The letter stated: “We currently have eight topical, all-natural, 50-state- legal, pesticide- and solvent-free, hemp oil/CBD, topical pain relief products that, we believe, are the very best on the market.”

Hartman shared that the products developed by the Company are created with a proprietary formula, which makes them more effective than competitors and at a lower price. “Unsolicited testimonies from satisfied customers validate our claims,” added Hartman.

Hartman also explained that the Company has sold most of their products online to date, with some smaller percentage of sales to pharmacies and medical facilities. However, the Company received a serious blow to its online sales when Amazon refused to list any products on their platform with CBD listed as an ingredient. Hartman is optimistic that the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill will eventually shift Amazon’s stance on the subject, but it may take some time.

In the interim, the Company will be reestablishing their position on Amazon by creating a product line labeled, “Nature’s Own Pain Relief”. This product line will not have CBD listed on the label and will therefore comply with Amazon’s guidelines. The Company will also be expanding their sales via direct distribution to retail establishments.

Premier Biomedical has recently been working with a large distributor that has access to convenience store marketing and sales. The distributor challenged the Company to produce a line of products that would retail for under ten dollars. Hartman explained that Premier worked very hard to develop a total of four new “Intro” products that would retail at or below this price point.

“We’re very excited about these new products, but unfortunately, manufacturing availability is waiting on the purchase order for some or all of these products from the distributor,” explained Hartman. He also added that he expects the purchase order to occur within the first quarter.

Hartman then shared that the distributor’s plan is to try these products out in up to 1,000 stores, and, if successful, expand into 10,000 stores nationwide. Meanwhile, the Company is working on preparing to market its entire line of Premium Products under the new name: “Nature’s Own Pain Relief” label.

The Company has also partnered with an additional distributor and will be altering their price points to perform more competitively in the market. Once these changes occur, the Company expects sales to increase exponentially.

Hartman explained that another distributorship for the Company revolves around military and long-term care sales, which represent massive potential revenues. Hartman emphasized that a major impetus in the growth of the hemp oil/CBD business is the fact that Premier’s products are an alternative to dangerous and addictive opioid pain medications that are a major contributor to the almost 200 drug overdose deaths per day in the country.

Hartman closed by sharing that the Company plans to proceed aggressively with their two-pronged sales strategy and expansion to become an even larger force in the industry. Hartman also shared his interest in potential partnerships, both domestic and foreign, and what they could mean for the potential of the Company.

20,CYDY Leronlimab (PRO 140) reduces by more than 98% human breast cancer metastasis in mouse xenografts for over 6 weeks,asug6r,bobbyusn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/asug6r/cydy_leronlimab_pro_140_reduces_by_more_than_98/,3,0,"*Based on strong results in its pre-clinical animal study, CytoDyn files for Orphan Drug Designation for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer*

VANCOUVER, Washington, Feb. 20, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CytoDyn Inc. ([CYDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cydy)), a biotechnology company developing a novel humanized CCR5 monoclonal antibody for multiple therapeutic indications, announces that it was able to reduce by more than 98% the incidence of human breast cancer metastasis in a mouse xenograft model for cancer through six weeks with leronlimab (PRO 140). Based on these results, CytoDyn announced yesterday its plans for the expansion of pre-clinical animal studies into eight cancer indications, driven in part on prior research by Dr. Pestell suggesting that CCR5 inhibition may disrupt signaling and ultimately the spread of CCR5+ Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC’s).  


In Dr. Pestell’s research laboratory, pre-clinical studies were conducted on mice using Pfizer’s HIV drug maraviroc in breast and prostate cancer.  Results were most encouraging using these CCR5 inhibitors, which ultimately led Dr. Pestell to design experiments applying leronlimab (PRO 140) to metastatic mouse models. The results of this pre-clinical study using leronlimab (PRO 140) in mice showed a reduction in breast cancer metastasis of more than 98% over the six-week period of the study.  The mouse xenograft model is designed to mimic human breast cancer metastasis.  With more than 98% reduction in tumor metastasis over a six-week period, in the mouse model, the company is optimistic about the potential for human development. The temporal equivalency of the murine 6 weeks study, may be up to 6 years in humans. 

“These positive pre-clinical results are very promising, and it gives new hope for future treatment options to cancer victims all over the world.  We are working diligently to present an abstract of this data in conference as soon as possible,” said Dr. Nader Pourhassan, President and CEO of CytoDyn.  “Should CytoDyn’s mouse xenograft breast cancer metastasis studies using leronlimab (PRO 140) correlate in humans (as Pfizer’s drug maraviroc did in colon cancer, in a trial conducted in Germany (see results on CytoDyn’s website ([www.cytodyn.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qiphsl-QyIN-r-pS25bZejo1EEfl7BMjJUVyYWZozXFMhTft44IaN7-a3wESsH3jC_dOgCKq1yWj8bCGWvytyg==))), this could open new possibilities for treatment options for breast cancer.  New treatment options of this kind would be welcome news for late stage cancer patients, who often experience deadly metastasis.”

Dr. Pourhassan continued, “We look forward with great anticipation to receiving interim data from our human trial in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is expected to be available within the next few months. If interim results are positive, we will promptly file for breakthrough therapy designation.” Dr. Pourhassan continued, “Negotiation of potential licensing opportunities has started on several fronts.  We hope to reach a definitive deal regarding a commercialization partnership for HIV and/or GvHD, which would further enhance the trajectory of our company.”
