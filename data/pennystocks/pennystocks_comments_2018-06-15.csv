You can only make the standard 3 day trades in a week or your account will be blocked for 90 days ( trades where you purchase a stock and trade it in the same day, buying a stock on Monday and trading it first thing when the market opens Tuesday is just fine) 
What you can do is find a scanner which will scan the market for stocks that meet all the criteria that you want and it will display those for you.  You will see generally a lot of stocks posted either here on Robinhood forum or others where people will mention stocks performing great that day. Be carful chasing stocks as they rise ",2018-06-15
