I notice as of December 31 2018,    
its price has eased down to 0.09,
 from about  0.60 around December 1.

I'm wondering if anyone here is following this company and knows if there is some news in the last month.   ",2018-12-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ab97ws/kovr_korver/
4,MSPC: New developments,ab8t4b,IknitSteel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ab8t4b/mspc_new_developments/,1,0,"Has anyone been watching the news surrounding MSPC? They have greatly increased their revenue and it they recently signed a LOI announcing they were planning on purchasing some cannabis grow space in California and possibly Connecticut as well. Stock is super cheap and looking forward to seeing how these new developments will pan out. 

I picked up 2.1million shares at .0004, and have some more cash on stand-by to pick up more shares if it drops a little more. 2019 could be a big year for this stock.
