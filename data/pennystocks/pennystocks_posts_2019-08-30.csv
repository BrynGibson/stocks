17,Trading is HARD,cxngmv,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cxngmv/trading_is_hard/,5,6,"***Trading is Hard. It‚Äôs very hard.*** You‚Äôre constantly competing against the sharpest, most intelligent human beings/computers in the world, who have deeper pockets, more information, and more experience than you do. You have to battle with yourself, go against the crowd, what‚Äôs so consciously innate to us, and battle the constant paradoxes that the market so often presents. There are many ways to make money in the market, but they‚Äôre hard to find. See? Paradox. You have to understand your opponents, have a proven game plan, and pick your battles wisely. Ready to play? Find a niche, dominate it, and become the house. 

No matter how strong a man‚Äôs will power may be, he is influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by what he hears or sees, and his actions or executions are interfered with accordingly. The trick is not to be the hottest stock-picker, the winning forecaster, or the developer of the neatest model; such victories are transient. The man who makes a success and keeps his money is the man who, after years of experience, has profited by his mistakes and schooled himself against his weak points. The trick is not to be the hottest stock-picker, the winning forecaster, or the developer of the neatest model; such victories are transient. ***The trick is to Survive!*** Performing that trick requires a strong stomach for being wrong because we are all going to be wrong more often than we expect. The future is not ours to know. But it helps to know that ***Being Wrong*** is inevitable and normal, not some terrible tragedy, not some awful failing in reasoning, not even bad luck in most instances. Most investors are driven by emotions that run the gamut from Extreme Pessimism to Jubilant Optimism. These Emotions can drive stock prices to the extremes of overvaluation and undervaluation.

Happy Trading! -
