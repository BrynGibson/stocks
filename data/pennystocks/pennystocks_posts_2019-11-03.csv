4,Watch $NLST Monday morning for their ER and at Noon for their CC,dr12x1,PoppinZs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dr12x1/watch_nlst_monday_morning_for_their_er_and_at/,9,2,"Facts are facts are facts are facts no matter what Netlist is able to disclose on Monday morning:

Fact I: Netlist won the ITC ruling a big deal illustrated by Silvia's assertion that ""first Standard Essential patent Infringement case won since 2013""; that is the first in 6 years; it almost reminds me of chances of making it  to World Series for some of the better teams! What Netlist is done is absolutely incredible and they deserve the full credit for persisting over years and years and fighting giants like SK Hynix and Google with billions of cash while Netlist has been forced to sell shares in pennies to make it. If nothing else this alone makes me have a world of respect for the management.

Fact IV: with money coming in from initial wins/settlements/MOUs Netlist will, as mentioned by the company numerous times, spend bulck of that money investing on R&amp;D and expansions while better fight the next infringers inline if they don't settle.

I suppose what I am saying is no matter what Monday brings Netlist is IMHO a multiyear play and should be treated as such by smart,  insightful, and ambitious investors and shareholders.

Fact II: The 907 win at ITC, and possible reversing of 623, will be a precedent for Netlist to go after other many infringers including Google.

Fact III: Not only no new kid in the block would now dare on Netlist's patents some of the old infringers will step forward to settle or sign MOUs once current ITC win is finalized (remember we are still at the ID stage although a win nonetheless).",2019-11-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dr12x1/watch_nlst_monday_morning_for_their_er_and_at/
