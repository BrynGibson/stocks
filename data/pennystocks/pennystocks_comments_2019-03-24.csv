Watched it climb, didn’t take profits because I thought we were destined for higher numbers in the $5-$7 range. Eventually sold in the low $2’s and took my thousand dollar profit then bought back in when it fell just below two bucks again. I’m hopeful that it’s headed back up this coming week with the AACR presentation on April 1st, but only time will tell. I like everything I hear about them, especially coupled with the high number of insiders buying in. Fingers crossed that they report some good news on their trials along with their revenue reports by their deadline at the end of the month.   ",2019-03-24

I've been holding since the news came out on Tuesday. Hoping this week brings continued green. Currently trading at .0171 but it spiked to .0189 right before close on Friday before dropping off a bit at close. Seems likely we will see .02 before the week is over. And then next week we will hopefully hear some more news on the share cancellation. Once that is executed the PPS could really skyrocket. Fingers crossed.,2019-03-24

It has been jumping from 0.015 to 0.017 and more, its a good cheap pot stock to get into if you missed out on the big boys. Website looks legit and well designed, lots of recent news and volume. Holding 100k shares. Price is expected to go up to 0.05, i think it can be more. 

Keeping an eye on **$LEAS**. A reverse merger has people hyped about potential of stock price that normally seems to range from 0.0022 to 0.0030 (current 0.0035) which also has the potentional to go to 0.05 according to the company. **$BBDA** is also getting reverse merged into the same company, whose stock i think is around 0.001 to 0.0013 range with high potential. 

**$GDET** is undervalued and i think it will have a nice bloom.

and... not a penny stock by I keep watching **$GE** and i wonder if they will go under $5 if they can't turn things around. ",2019-03-24

What they're doing might be similar to a lot of ""other"" companies to help consumers clean up their credit but the way they're doing it is pretty novel. Also, the ""drive-it-off"" thing is pretty interesting too... The Beta Music Group ticker is a real turn off though. If they can right that part of the ship, get listed, change the ticker they'll have a good chance at making some coin. They may have not invented credit counseling but they do have a really neat idea of how to drive business their way without a lot of costly advertisement. Then again Ray Kroc didn't invent the hamburger either. Strategically they need to get in-front of services like Credit Karma and offer their services to them to make it a complete package. I'm long on this one because the economy is eventually going to turn down and the absolute amount of consumer debt will eventually come back to roost when wages stagnate further and inflation ticks up even further. There are millions of people who can't own a home because of their current credit rating. ",2019-03-24
