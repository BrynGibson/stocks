I went through almost every company on a similar list a while back and there was basically nothing that looked that appealing. But that's the tricky part, taking these super small companies and trying to decide if any will become successful. The closest thing I came up with was KGKG (Kona gold) and related Company VATE. They do cbd related energy drinks and other beverages. Its always a gamble but they looked promising to me. 



That being said, their are some really appealing weed penny stocks that have much less risk such as Halo Labs AGEEF, Nextleaf solutions NXEAF, Enwave Corp NWVCF. 


Of course I hold these stocks so of course I think they're good so do your own DD lol



Let me know if you have any questions, Weedstocks sometimes isn't very beginner friendly
