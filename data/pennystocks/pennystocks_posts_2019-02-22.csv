I‚Äôm new to stocks. So I‚Äôve been playing with penny stocks. But this just came out today, and I‚Äôm not sure what it means. So for each 20 stocks I have, they‚Äôll give me 1. But do the stock prices reflect that? Or will they be the exact same price that 1 is worth now?",2019-02-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/atlulu/xspa_what_does_this_mean/

3,Question about ascending GAAP,atcw2t,arkitector,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/atcw2t/question_about_ascending_gaap/,3,0,"I've been doing a deeper dive into $ACLZ and I took a look at their growth analysis. It looks like their EPS GAAP is cutting in half year-over-year in an ascending trend. This also coincides with a subtle increase in revenue year over year.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that their stock has been on the decline, does this highlight anything positive about the company or does this shed no light on the quality of the EPS? This is something I'm trying to educate myself more on when I'm taking into account all the information available.",2019-02-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/atcw2t/question_about_ascending_gaap/
