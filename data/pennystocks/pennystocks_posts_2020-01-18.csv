Today, I introduce you to BIOC. One of which many penny stocks I wasn't fond of. Why does this interest me now than it did before? Quite a handful of reasons. On 3/26/19 I bought it at 1.25 and released it on 3/26/19 1.16 I wasn't comfortable there wasn't strong support and lacked continuation that I knew wouldn't keep going. Fast forward to 12/09/2019 I noticed a harsh knife drop; we all hate those. It reached a clear bottom stop at 0.22. Skeptical, but kept it on the watch. I could have bought at this position, however, I wanted to avoid the cup &amp; handle going downwards, not upwards. Assuming as such, it broke the pattern around 0.30 which in my opinion, is an unusual pattern than going downwards, but instead upwards.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been going up since 12/19/19 through 1/17/20. The pattern is coming to fruition for a continuation upwards out of the outside bar trend line, &amp; into something much much bigger. It's EPS has been doing well since 2016 down through 2018 (-57.63 through -9.01, impressive). Quite frankly, I am eager to see their earnings report this month. PE -0.12 which is incredibly reasonable to play with for a penny med stock, with a rating of one strong buy, and two buys. 

You'll find a reasonable point of interest support line continuing with a base support of 0.32, and stubborn resistance of 0.37 &amp; 0.40. Either, a strong rally needs to continue to break 0.36, and or followed by strong catalyst news to break 0.40. Terrifyingly, (assuming) if this so-called proclaimed buy out the rumor is coming into the light, the possibilities are endless. However, I would take the buy-out rumors with very little salt since GE refuses to comment on it and the rumor has been ongoing for years between BIOC  &amp; GE. But, I do believe a buy out is tangible whether it would be GE or other entities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Charting pattern: The bottom line, it's holding well and deserves a HODL opportunity. See bellow the image, and prove me wrong.

Am I missing something obvious? Commissions and fees should not be a problem if the trade is big enough, say 5.000 $.",2020-01-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eqlkex/why_isnt_everyone_rich/
