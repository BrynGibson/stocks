Not what they're asking. This person has $200 available in their Robinhood account that they want to play with. I don't think that's wrong.

If they said ""I've got $200 that I'd like to play on Blackjack, but I don't know anything more than the most basic of rules. What can you tell me to become a better Blackjack player before I dive in?""

You're not gonna say ""if you've got $200 you should NOT go to the casino, and you should put that in a low volatility, High yield 3x leveraged ETF and let it sit for the rest of your life until retirement!!""

Why does everyone gotta be such a grandpa whenever someone decides they want to play with some side money?

Give helpful info AND THEN include ""you should know that this is risky and by no means a get rich quick scheme..""

Other brokers have paper trade accounts also . This will allow you to learn the ends and outs of buying and selling without using real money. 
    Second decide what kind of trading you want to learn. Investing and trading are not the same . Swing trading and day trading are not the same . Though they do have similar traits they are different. I recommend you practice only one at a time till you get some experience under your belt.
    Now the learning. You need to know how to read the candle sticks lots of videos on that. Also you need to know basic candle stick patterns lots of videos on that. 
   I personally am a Day trader. I like the action of penny stocks so that‚Äôs where I trade. Also their cheap. But don‚Äôt think just because you don‚Äôt have a lot of money you have to trade penny stocks. If the trade is right you can buy just a couple of shares and make money.
     This will give you a good start . My basic strategy is in the premarket who has news and has gaped up .
