Oil +20% Again
 
Rally Fades by Half
 
 
Today’s market got off to a strong start yet again but at the end of the day we had two down waves starting around 2:45 that cut gains by about 2/3.  Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.  Tomorrow we have the ADP Employment change report for April and weekly MBA Mortgage applications.
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled “How to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,” over the long weekend.  I think it’s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is

SECTORS: Earnings played a part in today’s market.  NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.
 
Two companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.  EA was a miss and after closing $119.61 +2.78 it fell t0 112.12 and is currently 113.98 – 5.62.  Activision (ATVI) beat handily and it had closed 68.53 +1.83 and is now $72.40 + 3.87 more.  Pinterest (PINS) had risen from a low of $10.10 last month to close $20.81 -.62 but missed on several metrics and has traded down to $16.70 and is $17.15 – 3.66.  Also, on the bad news side, UAL finished $24.12 -1.14 (4.5%) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) warned about it continuing as a “going concern.”  The stock is down from $60 and finished the day $11.18 -3.26 (22.58%).

OIL, $24.56 +4.17. Oil was higher overnight and the rally continued on all day.  The stocks were mixed with only the big names moving higher.  XLE closed $37.52 +.43 (1.16%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,710.60 -2.70. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 165 calls and I replaced them with the $163 strike.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8985 +50. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today’s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.02 + .05 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Today Wealthbridge Acquisition voted to change their name to Scienjoy, a Chinese live-entertainment streaming company that they are reverse acquiring.

  

Downsides: It's a Chinese company, which means you're technically buying part of a cayman islands holding company. And, also, it's a Chinese company. So buyer beware and all that.
 
Upsides: The warrants are literally penny stocks with high growth potential, especially with a pending name change. The company is reportedly high growth in a high-growth market. As of the last numbers I can find (June 30th last year) they have 11.4 million subscribers and about 13k broadcasting partners broadcasting three primary show channels.

*-- Scienjoy anticipates net revenue growth of 21% from $108.1 million in
2018 to an estimated $130.8 million in 2019 and net income growth of 28%
from $15.5 million in 2018 to an estimate of $19.9 million in 2019.

 
-- The combined company will have a pro forma equity market value of
approximately $250 million at closing or approximately 12.6x 2019
Estimated Net Income and 9.2x 2020 Estimated Net Income, assuming no
redemptions.*

 

Disclaimer: I've been holding about a thousand shares of this (a tiny, tiny fraction of my portfolio) for a while.

A portion of the script: Hey guys it’s Flynn. Today I wanted to talk about MVIS. MVIS moved up 18.18%. Earlier today during trading hours MVIS went on a fire sale where a whale dumped 700,000 shares of MVIS onto the market. This resulted in a domino effect that triggered many people’s stop loss orders which brought share prices all the way down to 1.09 per share. This tactic to dump shares...

He posted a screenshot of him calling mvis weeks ago, when it was .35 cents, claiming he just knew about that too.

Normally I would dismiss this shut as garbage and it probably is...however apparently theres been an ongoing patent fight between the two companies and moderna has been having issues with them.


Moderna is way bigger and it would make sense for them to simply merge and both companies to stop the legal battle, especially for a small company like arbutus.

Potential News:
- Holding a conference call on 05/14/2020 with a potential discussion of earning reports
- Presentation on Twitch.tv showcasing their product and how they can help influencers

What does this translate to? 
Potential in more revenue streams for the company. They currently hold a few large corperations under their umbrella of pairing advertisements with ""influencers"". Of which are: Wendy's, Marriot, NBC, The Home Depot, Kraft, Petco. Their website also lists Audi, Mercedes, Porsche, Toyota, Burts Bees, CLOROX, Folgers, Chase, Paypal, Shopify, Target, Sams Club, Whole Foods, Walmart, Hasbro, Kohler, HP, Google Yahoo, Lenovo, Netgear, Intel, and Phillips. 

That's a long list of brands that IZEA pairs with ""influncers"". So let's say for example you have trackers on and googled ""lights"" 20 minutes ago, you'd get an AD on twitch about Philips Hue and a potential promo on Amazon since Amazon owns Twitch. Since IZEA is linked to such a large corporation like Amazon, I'd assume Jeff is trying to provide specific streamers with ad-deals and partnerships. Baba Jeff is lining his pockets some more. Shocker. 

My personal plan:

Buy in at Pre-Market around 0.36-0.37
Hold until the 14th or 15th and read more news.

Should I sell tomorrow, should I sell before call, should I risk it all and wait. 

Truth is no one can tell you, but here are some pointers from the past 24hrs.

MVIS is tied to MSFT, just look at their product it’s literally the same thing. https://youtu.be/uIHPPtPBgHk

The volume on this guy has 190 million more than S&amp;P!!! That’s 3x the amount in just one day!!

There was for a fact a whale that manipulated the price, this cause triggers to offset, with a panic sell for ppl trying to short this thing.

Patent was approved today, even if you think it’s false, read it carful and you’ll see MVIS referenced. Again Holo lens comparison.

Many MVIS employees are NOW MSFT employees, one in particular is a senior researcher (hint hint)

They are in the process to updating the holo lens to holo lens 2.

MSFT can continue to pay royalties, buy them out after they’ve paid their debt off, or honestly this company continues to grow because holo lens is the future.

I don’t believe this is a pump and dump, I believe this is to good to be true. If you want to sell to make a quick buck fine, but my own opinion, do your own DD, this guy is a win-win-win. Yes, there will be a bumpy road to the upside, but after the news either announced on the 7th after hours at 5pm, or 19th, I think based on the CEOs letter for exploring potential acquisition or merger on 5/1. We have good evidence to believe this is the real deal.

More info from investors hub

”Ex Microsoft (MSFT) Employees now work at MicroVision (MVIS) 
After some research by the community, a staggering amount of ex Microvision employees have been scooped up by Microsoft over the years. This growing list leads to suggest that Microsoft is very interested in MicroVisions technology and capabilities. 

Josh Miller – Director of Engineering at Microsoft and former Lead Systems Engineer – HoloLens (6 years at MVIS as Director of System Engineering) 

Scott Woltman – Director Hardware Engineering at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer, Systems) 

Richard James – Director of Optical Engineering HoloLens, former Director of Sourcing – Advanced Optics (14 years at MVIS as Director, Opto-Mechanical Engineering) 

Wyatt Davis – Principal Engineer at Microsoft (15 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer/MEMS Technical Lead) 

Jeb Wu – Principal Hardware Engineer HoloLens HW Design at Microsoft (5 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) 

Johnson Liu – Principal Optical Engineer (3 months at MVIS as Staff Engineer) 

Mark Champion – Principal Systems Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Principal Engineer) 

Mason Thomas – Principal Program Manager (3 1/2 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer for DARPA eye ware display) 

Greg Gibson – Senior Electrical Engineer at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineering Manager) 

Daniel Nevistic – Hardware Development Engineer – (2 years at MVIS as Electronics Engineer) 

Michael Beard – Senior Optics Test Manager – HoloLens, Senior Hardware Engineer (8 years at MVIS as Lead Systems Engineer of Image Quality) 

Shawn Swilley – Senior Hardware Engineering Manager, former Sr. Hardware Engineer (7 years at MVIS as Senior Staff Engineer) 

Justin Zilke – Embedded Systems Engineer (4 years at MVIS as Lead Engineer, Embedded Firmware) 

Minhua Liang – Optical Engineer (6 years at MVIS as Sr. Staff Engineer) 

Damon Domjan – Senior Embedded Systems Engineer (5 years at MVIS as Firmware Engineer) 

Robert Hilker – Manager HW Test Engineering at Microsoft (11 years at MVIS as Director, Global Manufacturing Technology) 

Bill Woodland – Sr. Director Strategic Sourcing (9 years at MVIS as Sr. Director) 

Taha Masood – Sr. Manager for Strategic Technology Sourcing for Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality Products at Microsoft (6 years at MVIS as Director, System Engineering, Design-Win and Technology Integration) 

Jack Clevenger – Sr. Program Manager (12 years at MVIS as Sr. Program Manager) 

Moh Eslamy – Process development working for both Microsoft and MicroVision (6 years at MVIS managing high volume manufacturing/assembly processing for laser projector) 

Karlton Powell – Senior Researcher (8 years at MVIS as Senior Research Engineer) 

Given both companies are headquartered in Redmond, WA, a Microsoft acquisition of MicroVision could be an extremely easy transition for both the company and employees. 

Microsoft (MSFT) currently using MicroVision (MVIS) Technology in HoloLens 
On March 31, 2020, Microvision agreed to an agreement for its April 2017 customer to take over production of the components MicroVision had been producing for the customer. Beginning in March MicroVision started earning a royalty on each component shipped that was approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced. 

Around the same exact time, Microsoft started expanding production capabilities for its Hololens in order to meet higher demands for the product. 

And to follow that up, the Army which is currently planing to equip its first units with the Integrated Visual Augmentation System toward the end of next year, thanked Microsoft for the expanded commitment to meet production demands. 

“Our Microsoft partners have been outstanding in reforming the supply chain where necessary and continuing on with the development in their production and manufacturing facility in California” 

And if the dots aren’t connecting enough, immediately after this on April 6th, MicroVision stated their first clue of possibly entering a buyout of some sort. “As we reported on March 11, we are actively engaged with multiple interested parties to evaluate various opportunities to license our IP as well as other strategic alternatives.” 

While no one knows for sure if MicroVision’s technology is in the Hololens, there have been some confirming reports stating that may be the case (found under Hybrid Arrive section). 

Microsoft (MSFT)’s Possible Expanded Use of MicroVision (MVIS) Technology 
The connection between MicroVision and Microsoft is almost undeniable when it comes to the Hololens reports and timelines. But an additional use of their tech may change everything. 



There are rumors and evidence that Microsoft is using MicroVision technology in their new expanded capability with the Xbox. Microsoft expanding their use of MicroVision technology can show us their interest and commitment to the technology, and also validate why they might think about buying MicroVision out. 

It’s interesting to note that Microsoft announced an Xbox Series X gameplay reveal event for Thursday, May 7, the same day as MicroVisions conference call. Whether anything of substance is announced is yet to be seen”

They had a meeting on Apr 22, the day after there was a volume of 2 million. Today there was a recent buy of 250k. So I think companies want to invest and are just waiting for a good time. Which means these buys are willing to lose money but know it will go up soon.

Looking through the presentation they gave I found some interesting things. I’m honestly a little surprised it’s not higher. For starters they are the leading company in their industry by market share(literally worth 13% of the entire industry). It’s also in UK and it’s 34% of the UK industry. But it’s mostly in US. They have consistently been gaining money compared to every other quarter.

For their debt they own their fleet so that doesn’t count. And they will only need to repurchase a fleet in 10sih years. Over the past year they have 5x their earnings. Looking at other money charts they have all improved compared to every other quarter.

They have made an offering of $10.20 for 2.5 million shares. There has also been a recent increase in buys. My thoughts say they are companies buying slowly just waiting for a good time. There has also been some recent insider buys which is usually a good sign.

Looking at the chart before all the corona business they were on an upward trend and above 5$ before hand. It looks like it’s back on that upward trend. And looking at sector trends the industrial sectors have been doing well. Like HIL and GV.

Personally I feel like Construction companies in general will begin to do well because there are a lot of cities that are hiring construction companies. Also a lot of people understand right now is the best time to do construction while people are stuck at home and it can get done faster.

Common questions:

What's the best price to enter for dip opportunity? 0.27

What's the breakout threshold? 0.30 but personally, I want it to break above 0.31 for a sure-thing confirmation.

Are you buying? I would but waiting for funds to settle from VAL.

Are you holding VAL? I broke even. Despite the attractive volume I was expecting to break a higher threshold via Fibbinocci style. 

Should I still hold VAL? So long as it doesn't fall below 0.41.

What's the price target? Possibly 0.47 to 0.50",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gefas5/zn_divine_insanitya_godly_outlook/

Looks like great news although unsure where it leads to quite yet. They have had a lot of offerings lately for more cash flow probably in prep for mining operations later this year. They look like they really know what they are doing and are poised for a run.

The main piece of news is that results from the land survey for newly acquired land from a few weeks ago were publicly released this morning. They basically show that the data from a previous survey is adequate enough to validate the results they have. I know there are some more knowledgeable materials folks on here that may understand it more and may provide better insight.

This is a lower volume stock but it may make another move like it did a few weeks back.

TDA on level II seems to be the most accurate.  Tradingview seems to be second.  And Webull, I am not sure if this is how its always been and I am just now noticing, but they seem to be WAY behind these other two.

## InnerScope Hearing Technologies (OTC: INND) To Launch  Hearing Loss Information Centers In Kiosks At 4,618 Walmart Locations  Nationwide

8:00 am ET March 30, 2020 (Globe Newswire) Print

 \-- InnerScope Hearing Technologies expects to reach millions of  potential hearing aid candidates with its affordable, self-fitting  hearing aid products prior to the Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act going  into effect. 

\-- InnerScope Hearing Technologies anticipates a significant  increase in sales revenue as hundreds of millions of Walmart shoppers  will have access to the Wellness Screening Kiosks. 

\-- More than 3 million unique monthly visitors already use  Pursuant Health's Self-Service Wellness Screening Kiosks located in  Walmart stores. 

InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. (OTC: INND) (InnerScope)  announced today it has entered into an agreement with Pursuant Health  Inc. to launch its Hearing Loss Information Center to all of Pursuant  Health's Self-Service Wellness Screening Kiosks located inside 4,618  Walmart and Walmart Neighborhood Market locations nationwide by June  2020. 

InnerScope's Hearing Loss Information Center will encourage  Walmart customers to take immediate action for treating their hearing  loss by either being referred locally to a contracted hearing healthcare  professional, or by directly purchasing one of InnerScope's Hearing  Products. InnerScope's management team believes the Hearing Loss  Information Center will become a trusted source for providing hearing  healthcare information, as well as information on the multiple health  and cognitive risks associated with untreated hearing loss. This  agreement gives InnerScope instant brand awareness and direct marketing  visibility to the hundreds of millions of Americans who shop at Walmart,  as well as the more than 45 million Walmart pharmacy shoppers who have  access to Pursuant Health's Wellness Screening Kiosks strategically  positioned near the pharmacy counters. 

Prior to the Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act going into effect,  InnerScope plans to utilize Pursuant Health's Wellness Screening Kiosks  to conduct a massive Hearing Loss Awareness Marketing Campaign to  improve the quality of life of the 48 million Americans that has some  form of hearing loss. The Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act was designed  to enable adults with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss to access  Over the Counter hearing aids without being seen by a hearing care  professional. The new law, which was sponsored by Senators Elizabeth  Warren (D-Mass) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), comes on the heels of the  elimination of the ""physician waiver"" system, which had required  consumers first to seek a physician for a medical evaluation or sign a  waiver prior to obtaining a hearing aid. 

InnerScope will also sell its Hearing Products to Walmart  customers on Walmart.com as a wholesale Direct-Ship Vendor. InnerScope  is taking ground breaking steps to be the only hearing healthcare  company leading the way to deliver easy and convenient access to hearing  loss information and affordable Hearing Products for the 48 million  Americans who have some form of hearing loss.  The management team at  InnerScope believes launching the Hearing Loss Information Center, along  with its Hearing Loss Awareness Marketing Campaign, within the 4,618  Wellness Screening Kiosks inside all Walmart stores will establish the  Company as a disruptive industry leader in the current $10  billion-dollar global hearing device industry. 

Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope, said, ""This opportunity to  integrate our Hearing Loss Information Center into Pursuant Health's  vast network of over 4600 Wellness Screening Kiosks positions us as the  only hearing healthcare company to deliver easy and convenient access to  affordable hearing products, as well as hearing loss information, for  the 48 million Americans who have some form of hearing loss."" Mr. Moore  continued, ""After we launch this campaign on June 1st, we anticipate a  significant increase in sales revenue as the millions of Walmart  customers who use Pursuant Health's Wellness Screening Kiosks have  access to our affordable, FDA registered hearing aids and personal sound  amplification products. With hundreds of millions of in-store Walmart  customers, as well as the millions of customers who can see our products  on Walmart.com, we are making great strides toward improving the  quality of life for people who suffer from hearing impairment and  hearing related issues.",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ges13y/innd_innerscope_hearing_technologies_inc/

Since joining this subreddit five trading days ago, my overall penny stock trading account is +35.34%. I was at around 50% but have overtraded today and yesterday. It happens. 

If you're interested, here is my twitch channel. There is also content there from previous videos. My TTI prediction of $0.70 fell about four cents short, but my MVIS prediction did really well. Please don't expect 100% accuracy on these predictions. My average is about 55-60% accuracy, but the higher reward than risk ratio keeps me profitable over the long term.

The CEO's explanation for this was that exercising his warrants and options in order to buy shares from the company was to provide cash for the company through buying existing shares rather than introduce new shares to the market and dilute the stock further, which they have done in the past.

However, the resale of the shares he purchased from CytoDyn through exercising his warrants/options is what drew suspicion. If he was so sure that leronlimab was going to be successful, why wouldn't he wait?

Meanwhile, however, they have contracted Ajinomoto's chemical and drug synthesis services to produce very large quantities in leronlimab, a relationship which Ajinomoto itself announced, and not CytoDyn.

It appears that CytoDyn themselves are aware they are against great odds and aren't sure if things are going to work out, but are pushing forward anyway.

NASDAQ/TASE: KTOV), a clinical-stage company advancing first-in-class therapies to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with several institutional and accredited investors for the purchase and sale of 25,000,002 of the Company’s ordinary shares represented by American Depositary Shares (ADSs), at a purchase price of $0.40 per ADS, in a registered direct offering, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10 million. **Kitov has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,000,002 ADSs.** Each ADS represents one ordinary share, no par value, of Kitov. The offering is expected to close on or about May 8, 2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

**The warrants will have an exercise price of $0.40 per ADS and will be exercisable at any time upon issuance and will expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance.**

Kitov intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the development of its oncology drug candidates, acquisition of new assets and for general working capital purposes.

204,$NAK is going to go up,geq8tv,TheFakeTheoRatliff,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/geq8tv/nak_is_going_to_go_up/,1,14,"Hey everyone, thought I'd share a little DD on $NAK, why it's rising, and why it will continue to rise.  The info contained here is publicly available, but I've added my perspective based on my knowledge of the industry (I'm a geotechnical/geological engineer).  I don't claim to have any inside knowledge of what's going to happen, but I've seen a few mining projects go through permitting and construction.  

$NAK is the symbol for Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.  If you couldn't guess, it's a mining company.  NAK has a long history, almost 40 years, of successful mining projects.  They are a Canadian company, headquartered in Vancouver.

NAK has 100% of the mining rights for the Pebble Mine in Alaska, which is the largest known unmined source of gold, copper, silver, and molybdenum *in the world*.  It would immediately become the largest gold/copper mine in the US, producing 613 thousand tons a year for 20 years.  The largest gold/copper mine in the USA currently is in Arizona and produces 475 thousand tons.  The mine is proposed to be an open-pit mine, which is generally the cheapest type of mine to run (good for profits!).  One of the biggest hurdles to open-pit mining is getting approval for environmental effects and mitigation.

The draft EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) has been available for the past year and a half.  A draft EIS is always made available to the public and left open for a period of time for public comment.  If there are significant environmental, cultural, or social issues with the project, this is when it will usually get axed.   The public statement period for Pebble Mine is now over and the full EIS is likely going to come out in the next couple months.  Usually projects of this size have significant backlash (think about pipeline projects in the news).  While there have been some complaints, the backlash has been unusually quiet for a project of this magnitude.  In addition, the state DNR has recently come out with a statement in support of the project and how it's more necessary than ever to get things underway.  Links: 

https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/DNR-letter-on-Pebble-permitting-fuels-doubt-for-fair-process-among-mine-opponents-570195571.html

https://www.thecordovatimes.com/2020/05/03/state-confirms-support-for-completing-mine-project-eis/ 

In addition, judges have continuously ruled against objections or attempts to slow the project down:

http://www.savebristolbay.org/in-the-news/2020/4/17/for-immediate-release-judge-halts-pursuit-of-bristol-bay-protections

If the federal permits come through, this thing is virtually guaranteed to be fast-tracked through state permit approval.  The federal and state governments are scrambling to mitigate the effects of COVID on the economy - this would create 3000 jobs and generate wealth out of the ground.  

Shouldn't all of this be priced in already, you say?  Well, I'm sure it is to a certain degree.  Mining projects, especially ones of this scale, have a TON of uncertainty in this stage of the game, though.  There are still things that can happen to slow the project down or increase the costs of the operation.  However, based on how I've seen projects like this go down over the years, the hurdles seem pretty insignificant on this one.  

In addition, once the full EIS comes out it would just take one tweet from Donnie to send this thing through the roof.  Couldn't you see this coming across his desk in one month and he decides to puff the project up?

OK, maybe that last bit was just a pipe dream.  However, you just know his EPA isn't going to reject it.  You know the state is pushing hard for the project.  Give it a look and feel free to add anything else you find here.  All the permit and EIS documents are available on the Army Corps' website here:

People seemed to like my post yesterday so why not make it a recurring thing? We could all use some structure right now.

The big tickers flooding the sub today were remnants of **$MVIS** (r.i.p.), the new hotness of **$IZEA**, and **$GNUS** coming in later in the day. Hopefully, these stocks will continue to rise in after hours for those who joined up after they had already begun their journey upwards

**DDs YOU SHOULD READ**

However, I thought I could first list some solid DDs that may have been overlooked today.
[**$ZN by u/TheBazaarTrades:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gefas5/zn_divine_insanitya_godly_outlook/) The bloodhound of our humble sub did it once again. Since this post, $ZN rose over 16% to close out the day. Required reading right here and pray that prices will float upwards more.
[**$BBCP by u/DragonElder:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gebmag/bbcp_a_way_more_in_depth_dd_honestly_think_its/) First post I seen from this user, but a lot of promise here in his skills and his point about construction sticks. I live near the tristate and i-95 is popping off right now. The important part is that $BBCP rose over 4% today and the chart suggests a new upward trend.

**WHAT I WAS WRONG/RIGHT ABOUT YESTERDAY**

I personally took a large hit on $KTOV and $VAL today. Not sure if those could bounce back in after hours, but I’m planning on holding cause I’m a stubborn ass. I got scared and left $SHIP as well. Didn’t want to become so jaded just yet.
However, I was lucky on $RTW which jumped today more than 15%. I guess everybody gets one. $BIOC also keeps growing so once more… thank you u/cicero1982 who recieves a lot of shoutouts on stocktwits like a folkhero.

**THE NEW CLASS**

**$SINT** - This guy jumped up almost 6% today after making steady gains for the past five days. Might be a long-term hold but (define “long-term” as more than overnight) could be pumped if continues to grow in volume or large change in after-hours trading. 

**$UMRX** - My personal baby so take this enthusiasm with the largest grain of salt. Heading towards preclinical trials for newly developed cancer tumor treatment and beat their last earnings quarter by 120%. [Here’s my first ever DD for some links]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gelspn/umrx_from_the_ground_up_dd_in_comments/)

**$CNAT** - Picked this up from stocktwits. Has a merger vote tomorrow, but debate over whether that’ll raise it up to $1-ish. At least, [that’s what it’s being valued at for the merger]( https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/28/1976385/0/en/Conatus-Pharmaceuticals-and-Histogen-Enter-into-Definitive-Merger-Agreement.html)

**$SXTC:** Traditional Chinese medicine [rated as a buy a few days ago.]( https://zolmax.com/investing/china-sxt-pharmaceuticals-nasdaqsxtc-lifted-to-buy-at-valuengine/4041201.html) This may be the riskiest one I checked out, but it made a nice +7% tease during trading today.

And that’s it for today. I hope some of this info is useful, or at least entertaining to read. Support your local DD-ers here on r/pennystocks and as always…

IZEA had a pretty big spike overnight and flew up to .74 today, its sliding back down a bit just like it did yesterday, the run should last until 5/14 earnings call.  


Found an early [Q2 news release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/05/1995930/0/en/IZEA-Completes-TapInfluence-Platform-Integration.html) about the transition from IZEA's TapInfluence program being integrated into their new IZEAx platform for both influencers and marketers/brands. With this the recapture of a Major Fortune 500 client as well as other smaller clients being reintegrated and spending with IZEA. Earnings should be stellar in my opinion. This, coupled with the new BrandGraph System and the new access to Twitch for marketers and influencers, should result in major gains this quarter (as well as Q3 but not getting ahead of ourselves).

Kitov has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,000,002 ADSs. Each ADS represents one ordinary share, no par value, of Kitov. The offering is expected to close on or about May 8, 2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

""Kitov intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the development of its oncology drug candidates, acquisition of new assets and for general working capital purposes""

The new drug, (consensi), will be making a debut mid next week (i believe the 5/15). It's a combo drug of amlodipine and colchicine, essentially a hypertensive and arthritic combo med.

I'm bullish on this one with caps of 0.4, not sure if it will go ""to the moon"" but a solid 10% gain is pretty real. Volume is high today at 39.78M which is about 2.5x MKT CAP. It's getting a lot of PR over on stocktwits and [Sabby Management just purchased 8.3 million stock today](https://fintel.io/i/sabby-management-llc)

291,My 2 cents i guess,geo061,zxvegasxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/geo061/my_2_cents_i_guess/,1,4,"So when I look around for stocks to buy, i do my on DD on the ones that look promising. At the same  time, lets say, one of my researched stocks is getting more traction in the field (Reddit posts, etc). I wait a bit longer and make my move when i feel its right. (Had to get in on MVIS at 1.10 feeling a bit FOMO on Monday morning, but also feeling the UAVS karma, never bought UAVS). Two days later the hype has died and the stock is back at 1.10. WTF right? I had SO MANY FUCKING CHANCES TO MAKE MONEY. And what did I do? Believed in this hype train for this pretty looking penny stock. Like I have seen so many times before on these subreddits is that you just got to get your gains and GET THE FUCK out. Penny stocks are volatile AF and no one knows what could happen in a matter of 8+ hours. 

I am now making a committing to limits on my investments from here on out:

**- A gain is a gain whether you like it or not.** (I had speculation and faith that MVIS would hit $2 yesterday, and lost on it cuz I wanted more than what they were giving me, so I held. Now im $100+ down the hole, when i could have been $200+ in swimming profits)  
\- **Dont put more than 2/3 (probably sticking to 1/2 at most) of what you can afford into one stock.** (Having diversity in others is good. I was tunnel vision with MVIS. You gotta have a broad mind with this shit. I bought 40 shares of EZEA yesterday evening at .34 for shits and gigles. Now look at it. MISSED FUCKING OPPORTUNITY. All because I was in over my head with MVIS and it taking over 90% of my portfolia. Lesson learned)  
**- Limiting myself. Setting a base amount of cash for only trading.** (What I mean by this is that I will be investing only a set amount of dollars and no more. 1k is my set amount, so if i make 25% off of a stock, im putting those profits in my pocket and and holding onto my 1K of cash for more investing. I will never use no more than 1K to invest. Any profit that exceeds my set amount of 1K, it will go straight into my savings account and out of Robinhood. I suck at explaining shit so hope y'all understand)

So y'all. Write down your limits on a sticky note and  abide by those rules you set for yourself and stick to it. I've heard it many times before on these penny stock subreddits and im finally taking initiative for myself with these tips. Im hard headed like a lot of people on here are, be open minded and take in any kind of information that you feel is essential.

my rant is over... typing this will also help me establish these rules for myself. 

also i dont give a rats ass about negative comments. 

positive thoughts turn to positive actions

So I was always told to have a goal in mind that way you have a proper strategy to reach that goal. I'm 27 years old and my goal is to buy a house (600k budget) and pay it of as soon as possible. I work a normal job making a normal salary (35k-55k). I have no education and cannot go back to school so this job is pretty much it for me. Maybe a few raises here and there. Long story short, I came to the conclusion that in order to make money I'd have to have something else on the side. I checked a few options and decided that trading is the way for me since it's not time consuming and I can do it a few minutes a day, set a stop loss and let 'er ride. I've been making decent gains anywhere between 20$ to 70$ a day trading with a 700$ account. My goal is to reach high 5 figures without having to add any capital, just working off the initial 700$. I know I might be living in fantasy land but I see a lot of people posting hundreds of dollars of gains with a small capital. Now I know it can all be social media flexing but worst case scenario I'm willing to lose the 700$ since the reward is worth the risk.

Ive been working full time and when I wanted to make my money into more money this escalated into me putting about 3k into the market on March 23, one of the lowest days of the crash. I bought BA at 98, DAL at 21, UAL at 23, BABA at 173, V at 137, SYY at 38, and more. They were all good companies that I expect to recover after rona, none of them were penny stocks except for I guess MFA, but I sold that for a 15% profit. Anyways, I then started to flip tech on offerup/eBay and still turn 50-100% profits. And a yesterday I made my almost aggressive move yet. I looked at posts about MSIV, did about 1-2 hours of DD and bought 400 shares at 1.7. Ik I’m a dumbass for this. I saw the dip at 9:35 and thought it would start climbing, which it was. But everyone knows what happens next. Slimy whale took his money and screwed the little guy like me. He was a genius but I still hate him. With that said, IT IS NOT ANYBODY’S FAULT BUT MY OWN. I swear to God if I see more people complaining about how they lost money bc they bought high and sold low I will stub my toe just to take my mind off of how painfully low some of y’alls IQs are. Nobody told you to buy, you did that. I will recover because I only put in what I was willing to lose. But some of y’all hope you can yolo your life-savings for a Lamborghini. THIS ISNT WSB, be smart about whether or not you can afford to lose and admit when you’re wrong. Im still holding and hoping to break even but no matter what I’m selling before the news.

VISL, they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless Telecom industry. They have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well.

\*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL

  [DD on his recruitment](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/23/2005120/0/en/Vislink-Technologies-Appoints-Jim-McGowan-as-Vice-President-and-General-Manager-of-its-MilGov-Business-Unit.html) 

 \*Their recent contract bids that have been accepted. Sure, you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in, but look at who they are contracted with. It's a small sheriff's department &amp; guess who got them the contract in the first place? **Jim McGowan**. This shows that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, this company is still putting in solid work &amp; after they complete this project, with the help of **Jim McGowan**, they will continue getting government and military contracts. He just barely joined at the end of March and won them this government contract. 

 [DD on this contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-wins-a-99285-00-project-to-replace-existing-infrastructure-to-our-new-ciras-6-way-all-integrated-receiver-and-antenna-system-for-sheriffs-department/)

  \*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts. 

 [DD](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-chosen-to-provide-high-definition-live-on-board-video-systems-for-the-prestigious-european-ferrari-challenge-race-series/)

  \*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology. 

 They will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting. This meeting will be on May 8th

 \*SEC filings: on 4/23/2020 VISL filed an 8K form, it only be bad if they were going bankrupt, but they are not. This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday. 8k

 In the past two weeks on their company website, they share news of their current contract acquisitions &amp; each time they released something positive, their value flew up (albeit a small change) but still, it's a positive change. [Correlation](https://pasteboard.co/J6gfJAu5.png) 

 

\*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 28 dollars right now. I personally bought 2000 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 2000 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 2000 shares.

Anyy, that's my take on VISL. I personally think it's a strong buy &amp; if tomorrow there's a dip, I'll buy more.

Take care &amp; as always, if you have doubts always do some DD on your own to make sure you're okay with purchasing whatever stock you decide to buy. Gg fellas :)",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gen4kj/if_you_missed_on_mvis_or_even_izea_new_one_to_hop/

So, instead of admitting it's impossible to profit long-term by swinging these pumps long, these traders double down. Like playing slots, they are always the losers, because they don't even know they are playing against the house.

**Incompetent**
-

Ever notice how each stock pick, those hype picks that you see on the front page, always fail? They always drop, even after a week. Those, like myself, who bring up the fact they fail, are met with usual replies:

* You need to sell sooner rather than later

* I bought before the pump even started

* Gibberish about how the company is great

* I'm a bad person for even suggesting the idea they'll fail

Now all these vapid arguments all have one thing in common, the person has a vested interest in the stock. It's pretty amusing, because they create posts that are entirely emotion based. Some are more clever. Emotional based posts under the auspices of ""DD."" I'll get to why this subreddits ""DD"" is nothing more than confirmation bias.

**Shockingly uniformed**
-

Newbie traders, who admit they're new, should be given the benefit of the doubt. Although, newbies helping newbies create more newbie decisions, perhaps this is a bad cycle. While I can't prove it, sometimes there are manipulative forces that jump into subreddits like this. They mask themselves as ""arbiters of preforming proper DD."" These people are nothing more than newsletter frauds, who have blended in to almost seem real. 

Read into astroturfing.

Ever notice how many DD posts contain a laundry list of reasons why a company is a good buy. Where is that short-biased DD? One side of the trade is correct, so perhaps there's more to it then ""microsoft may have a stake in it."" Ironically, if you keep track of these hype stocks posted on here, all that DD is laughable. Re-read a few from a couple months ago. Check where those stocks ended up. 

**Never profitable long term**
-

Over the past 5 years, I've seen this subreddit grow into something pretty insane. A new stocktwits has formed. Pumpers, gullible sheep, and the occasional good trader make up the population on here. I remember posting similar things 5 years ago. These traders, who were confident in their positions at the time, would fire back at my contrarian arguments by saying my arguments are wrong. How many of these traders survived?

None.

None of those accounts, over 100 traders, survived.... except myself. I was short-biased, they were long-biased. Wave after wave, month after month, newbie traders are flushed out. Gullible traders, otherwise known as sheep, are the first ones to blow up. They are the slot machine players. The buyers into these hype stocks creating ""DD"" as a mask for their confirmation bias.

Made a few hundred bucks literally clicking my mouse for a total of 30 seconds.  Yes I could have held it longer and made more money.  But there are so many times I have held it longer and made less.

It took me awhile to get the right mindset about it.  I felt like I made the wrong choice selling the stock for less than I COULD have sold it for.  When in reality I made the right choice buying the stock in the first place.  I made money on the stock.  That was the outcome I was hoping for by purchasing it.  I accomplished what I wanted from it.

I posted some stuff about the izea DD I was shown here on this sub.  We have until the 18th to ride this ride.  If you feel you have made a killing on izea so far ( which you have ) you have lots of time to get in and out of this stock.  Take the wins you see and build that account up.

1. Look at the May 1st letter from the MVIS CEO to stockholders (stickied on r/MVIS). It gives implores investors to support a reverse split and states that the company is still exploring being bought out. Very noncommittal language. 

2. An acquired company is not likely to make the announcement that it is being bought. That right would likely go to Microsoft. Therefore, it's very unlikely to me that we'll see any announcement tomorrow or the 19th. 

3. Zoom out to a week of the stock's action. Look at that shape. The pump and dump is over for now. 

Here's what I believe will happen: MSFT waits until the hype dies down and the stock falls below $1. On the 19th, bag holders get fucked with a reverse split. The stock price falls again. THEN, Microsoft will buy for a nice discount. 

If I'm wrong, then send me pictures of your new Lambo on Friday. I'll be riding my bike to work.",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gelku7/a_case_for_dumping_mvis/

445,Personal strategy for buying &amp; selling stocks,gel4w2,AliveAndWellness,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gel4w2/personal_strategy_for_buying_selling_stocks/,11,28,"Personal strategy for buying &amp; selling stocks

In the past, I haven't had a predetermined plan after doing my DD and making a stock purchase. I'd basically buy and hold, and hope for the best. In the market, there are numerous variables at play, and since I work full time, there's no way I can stay on top of the latest news and changes in price on a frequent basis at times. 

Therefore, I decided to create a game plan that can be applied to every purchase. There are 3 main components of my plan, which I employed successfully for the first time with MVIS, and I was very pleased with how it turned out. I have a position in IZEA, and seeing as how there's a lot of interest in said stock, I'll use it as an example to illustrate my approach.

This is a lengthy post due to the equations being shown throughout the steps. I'm not great at math, and find it helpful to write each step out as a visual que when trying to wrap my head around something, and hopefully it helps others who may want to try this approach to plug in their numbers.

At the time of writing, I've completed steps 1 &amp; 2.

Steps:

1) Recover total cost of initial purchase when stock price increases by 50%

2) Lock in a profit

3) Freeroll 10% of total number of shares initially purchased

Here is my position with IZEA, and what this strategy looks like:

IZEA: 

Bought 735 @ 0.34 = 249.90 USD

Step 1:

Multiply your average price by 1.5 to find out what a 50% increase in stock price would be. Next, divide your total number of shares by this number.

So, 1.5 times 0.34 = 0.51 (50% increase)

Next, divide 735 by 0.51 = 490 shares.
At this point, enter a sell order for 490 shares @ 0.51 (490 times 0.51 = 249.90 USD). I set it as a Limit GTC. 

Once your order executes, your total initial purchase price has been covered. You're now essentially freerolling.

Step 2:

Our focus now shifts towards the main priority which is to lock in a profit. I've set a personal target at 50% of total initial purchase price, which would be 124.95 USD.

735 minus the 490 shares we previously sold = 245 shares remaining. 

Jump forward to step 3 for a moment (factors into the equation for step 2). We want to retain 10% of total shares to freeroll carefree with initial purchase price covered and a profit locked in. So, 10% of 735 is 73.5 (round down to 73). 

Subtract 73 from your 245 shares remaining and you're left with 172.

My personal goal is to lock in a profit which equals 50% of total initial purchase. To find this, you'll need to figure out what stock price you'd need to hit in order to achieve this. In this example, 172 @ 0.726 = 124.87 USD (close enough to 124.95). Once again, create a sell order as a Limit GTC. Once the order executes, move on to the third and final step.

Step 3:

Great! You've covered your initial purchase price and have locked in a profit, and now it's time for the fun part.

At this point, you have 73 shares remaining that you can do whatever you'd like with carefree since you're freerolling and have secured a profit.

My goal is to achieve 100% of the total initial purchase price (249.90 USD in this case). Since I've already acquired 50% in step 2, I just recalculate what I'd have to sell my remaining 73 shares at to make an addition 124.95 USD.

73 @ 1.71 = 124.83 USD (close enough).

The primary purpose of this approach is to have a predetermined plan before you even buy shares. I feel it's a fairly conservative approach but also allows room in step 3 to have a little fun. I prefer a more conservative approach. However, if the price is taking off, you may choose to ride the gain train instead.

You might already have your own strategy or perhaps you haven't yet considered using one. Just wanted to share mine to start a discussion and possibly help a few people!",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gel4w2/personal_strategy_for_buying_selling_stocks/

As you all know, MVIS is the ""big thing"" when it comes to these forums, as of late.

But after Thursday, the company will either go big time and partner with MS and hit a reverse split (MS will buy out the company and MVIS will hit a split), or the partnership will end up being a fluke and the share price will dropped drastically (like UAVS did, scary stuff).

After this week, MVIS will be forgetton about, either way. IZEA has been getting some talks and rumors, I'm thinking that it's the next co to look out for. They have their rumored partnership with Twitch and two upcoming events, coming on the 14th and 18th of the month.

With that news, I think this will be a really good buy. Got in at $.50 and I'm most likely holding until the 16th. Thoughts?

531,GFV cash account - etrade ?,gel0yl,pinkspardel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gel0yl/gfv_cash_account_etrade/,1,0,"Question, yesterday I sold AMPY (that had settled) and bought IZEA. I want to sell IZEA because it's blowing up... but when I go to sell it says I might have a good faith violation. I have read online though if  I just deposit cash to support the original buy it doesn't matter? or all it does is restrict me to settled cash only for 90 days? Is that how it works? 

Thanks!!",2020-05-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gel0yl/gfv_cash_account_etrade/
