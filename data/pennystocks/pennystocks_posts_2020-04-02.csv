11,TRNX - It's your turn to shine,fti98v,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fti98v/trnx_its_your_turn_to_shine/,1,4,"Evening. Prior to Tuesday's performance, I apologize once again. I and others were hit with all-around fake bullish waves, fake breakouts, and dagger knife falls. We, as traders, will not make that mistake again. The lesson here, in a situation where the NASDAQ &amp; S&amp;P 500 chart are going sideways in the daily market, browse with caution. Considering the decent call outs I made, always observe assuring it's maintaining it's momentum and doesn't touch the max top and slamming hard down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did some overnight review, and I did find something with a powerful credible activity happening with my favorite chart thus far, [TRNX](https://ibb.co/9VYvMzX) Here are the pros and cons about this stock that are highly considerable a bullish explosion waiting to happen.

Pros: 

Outside bar breaking downtrend line resu inlting a NHOLD/HODL

Low float

Minimum gap target: 0.47, max target: 0.80+

EPS has been very well maintained &amp; balanced (great improvement in 2018 Q4)

Above all decent debt asset ratio, 24.05% ranked fairly well

PB: 0.09 (in trader's eyes, this is a good probability ratio to play with)

Considerable assets

Reviewed heavy ticket orders noticed at near after hours around 6pm est.

Oversold reaching a full bottom

1day chart appears to form a complete cup.

The daily chart shows NHOLD as mentioned above.

Cons: 

A lot of bag holders, likely to sell-off, however in conjunction to short sellers, the buyers are outweighing the shorters.   

The daily chart shows it's been dipping a lot, however, I recommend caution &amp; buy only if it matches the criteria, in my opinion, breaking more than 0.17 to 0.18 + 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, for those asking if I am holding in anything else, I am still currently holding XSPA. As the news has been recently reporting, the US, unfortunately, are using outside tents as a form of hospital care. I sincerely hope XSPA (despite originally it was a spa source) will be a contribution and an asset aiding people somehow.",2020-04-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fti98v/trnx_its_your_turn_to_shine/

INDUS has a really big foothold in serval hundred dispensaries and just received investor funds to setup more greenhouses to fill their demand. When I listened to their recent investors meeting if I remember right they have accounts with 700+ dispensaries but only produce enough product to fill orders for about 300 of them, and with the new greenhouses coming into production they expect to produce 72 million dollars in flower alone. That’s not even taking into account the income they’ll receive from their exaction revenue.

Instead it was just encouraging them to hop in on the next stock that's hyped up. It seems like everyone agreed with this statement and within 12 hours we had +250 join us. As of now, we are currently recruiting ""Intermediate - Advanced"" traders. If you have a moment, check us out.
