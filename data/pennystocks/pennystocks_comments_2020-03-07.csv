The only real way to do it is to run a scan for stocks primed for a breakout (I can’t remember all the filters off the top of my head, but things like crazy high volume and gradual positive momentum, insider trading) and then literally google all the stocks that come up and look for news that could Act as a catalyst. That’s the only way to find it before it spikes, and there always the possibility that it won’t.

Finding breakouts before they happen is the traders holy grail",2020-03-07

This is one of about 8 shorts in the last 2 weeks. I’m not going to keep proving myself. I have nothing to hide. I’m not a newbie and I’ve learned how to be profitable even while at work screwing off on my phone. When I have time on a computer I can do better but I’m usually working during trading hrs. All my long plays are in IRA for tax reasons. All day trades are in TD cash acct and WeBull. I’m not interested in arguing with you. You seem like a narrow minded person that is sold on one strategy. If that works for you great. Keep using what works man. I’m telling you there are other strategies that work. They are risky and take time to learn but they are there. You have to have strict rules and live by them. Once you learn the rules it is relatively easy to make 1,500 plus minus per day over several trades. I use between 5,000 and 8,000 per trade usually and I’m looking for quick sniper shot gains and I’m out. I buy an RSI between 25-30 and sell 45-60 but that moves around some. Only mess with high movers. MacD can help give a second backup hard buy signal sometimes. Low volume duds are not candidates. I’m just telling you your wrong and you should be trying to learn what’s right verses slamming a working strategy. I’m saying this to help you expand your horizon not just to be a smart ass.

You are right that it’s 90% hype. Your wrong that you can’t play the hype and make real money. You just have to live by strict rules and live by them and be carefully. I’m the morning you have to watch volume in relation to news and watch the share price, volume, L2, and Sometimes MacD to begin telling a story. As you learn how they react in relation to each other you can start licking good buy ins and sells.

This is why we have an FDA and the need for multiple vaccines, is a necessity. If they fast track this too much,we may not know the side effects and may do more harm than good. I already heard there are a couple strains and if it continues to mutate  the original vaccine may not work and have to start over. How long will the vaccine work and will you need it every year or what?

They will need to get the vaccine to every one or it will just keep cycling as there are a couple strains.  It also appears a person can get this multiple times,not sure if different strains or same. If people don't have insurance,how will this be handled ? What about homeless and basically the whole world as it will just keep circling the globe. What about anti vaccine people ?

167,Bubbs77,fjrzz22,/r/pennystocks/comments/fep6qi/cocp_major_coronavirus_news_out/fjrzz22/,1,"When I enter a position I’m usually in for a matter of minutes. I work In the oilfield for my primary job but in my days off I’ve been sub-contracting my house. Been working on it over a year and almost done. This past week I’ve had lots of contractors tying up loose ends so I’ve been busy in the morning. Here’s how yesterday worked out as an example of most of my days. I made $1,390 over 5 trades. I woke up and checked all the top movers on TD and started reading through news and taking note of previous 10-Day volume, current volume, and outstanding shares, also took note of last few months trend in the chart to see where it has been.  I noted the 24hr RSI pattern and how it was developing. I made a watch list of about 7 stocks, through the morning I had a friend alert me about one stock and I also decided to use one of Tim Sykes recommendations on his daily watchlist. Once I had a plan I lined out 3 different contractors on what I wanted done for the day. By now it’s 7:45am and I get off by myself. Even though I had one or two phone calls i ignored them and I made 2 trades prehours. They dip so fast it’s hard to get in at bottom so you have to be fast. Sometimes you miss the bus but don’t chase. There will be another bus coming by in a matter of mins. If you’re playing the right stock with the right volume, and you get a dip into the low 30’s or 20’s on RSI the dip will not last long. Soon as she starts running back up I’m out. It’s all in a matter of mins. I also don’t hold through market open unless it’s a perfect set up. I’m usually sold out of all prehour trades by 8:15-8:25, once market opened yesterday I was able to make 2 more trades and was done by 9:00 with folks tugging me away from the market. I had made 1,150 in an hr and 15mins. It’s not easy to do that every day or even every hour of the day but generally speaking the couple hours before and after market open are the most volatile and therefore create the best setups for this strategy. Later yesterday afternoon we had some errands to run. My wife had to go to the bank for a deal she has going with one of her family members. It was around 1:30pm. I pulled up my old list and started looking for another candidate. I caught one sell off, trigger stop losses, and then a little panic sale, RSI dipped in the low 20’s, I got filled in the high 20’s and sold in the mid 40’s for a fast and relatively safe $240 sitting in the car while my wife was in the back. I just juggle this thing when I can. If I go take a crap I’m screening stocks. And yes I’ve made money on the can.!!! 😂😂 I’m not ready to go full time trader yet but I squeeze it in every time I get a chance. Some days I have lots of time and the market isn’t moving and I only make a little. Other days I’m busy but the market is full of set ups and I make good money while I’m busy. You just have to work with what you got. It’s taken me a long time to get this comfortable risking 5,000 - 8,000 dollars to make a few hundred. I’ve had runs that made me a couple thousand cause I got lucky and caught a short squeeze but I’m generally risking a lot for a little. But here’s the kicker. I’m playing on house money in my trading accounts and I play very careful. 5,000
Can make you 1,000per day, relatively safely, and over several trades, if you stick to strict safe rules, and if the market is moving. Sometimes it’s not moving so you settle for a 250 day. Sometimes you crap the bed and have a red day. I’m currently at 1 or 2 red days a month and it’s usually because I broke my own rules.  FOMO has got to go. Cut losses quickly, take profits quickly and take only the perfect shot. 

My trades for yesterday were, HTBX twice, ENZ twice, &amp; OPK

VWAP is another I did not mention. Learn all you can about RSI and L2 first. Then the #1 best teacher is to watch the indicators in action for many many hours. Once you have an idea trade very small amounts of your own money based on what you think you’ve learned. You will likely find out where your wrong before you find out where you are right. Learn why you made a bad call and make adjustments until you are profitable  most of the time. Then start increasing the size of your position until you are at a practical level. This is only one of many many strategies out there. And it will take time to learn, but if you learn it you will have a working strategy. Don’t rush it and take your time.

$8,000 gets me 8,000 shares of a 1.00 stock and .03
Cents gets the same profit.

Both are good buys if the movement and price action is there but I’d generally go for the 1.00 stock if I had to choose. 

I wouldn’t get hung up on a screener until you understand how to set it up. You don’t even know for sure what your looking for so you can’t really set it up. Start out by watching the top 10movers on NYSE and NASDAQ and take notes. After a lot of time watching you will understand what it is you are looking for and then you will be able to know how you want your screener to communicate to you, therefore you will know how to set it up.

Eventually it will click and you will be on your way. As far as reading material I have never read a book but I have reads tons and tons of website material. I’ve also watched tons of videos on YouTube. The greatest help I received was the 30hr class by Tim Sykes “How to make Millions”. This is a great introductory class and will help tie up a lot of loose questions about the stock market. It was huge help to me getting started. That being said I do not follow how method tons tee and I’m sure he would disagree with some of what I do but he is a good teacher and he will help you get started.

In terms of likelihood for tomorrow, the analysis points to being an up day for HTBX. I could also see it being flat on Monday and then taking off on Tuesday instead. 

The news over the weekend also points to CV being in focus. Plus, with the Gates Foundation announcing that they’ll be creating in-home tests, it’s possible the money will leave the stocks focused on CV testing kits. Sometimes news disseminates slowly so there could be a delayed effect on Tues instead. 

Having said all of that, win or lose tomorrow and the early part of this week, I think this will be my last analysis. It’s been very time consuming, and I’ve dealt with a lot of idiotic investors (not you) which is even more of a time waste.

I’m just happy that I helped a lot of people make a lot of money on INO and MRNA, and I REALLY hope I have one more in me with HTBX.",2020-03-07

Tomorrow the SSR is back on. HTBX is a heavily shorted stock. If we get news, we'll get the volume and the stock will pop high. The short squeeze will definitely be on.

Without news, HTBX may recover a bit, and it'll only pop if people think news is about to drop.

Why do I keep thinking news is imminent?  
Mgmt has to get the stock above $1 for 10 days straight before mid-June, or else they get de-listed. As I mentioned in my original post, the CEO is heavily compensated by stock, and I'm sure he doesn't want to do a reverse split. They really want to get this up to $1, and I think they'll make one last ditch effort to get the stock to pop since they have some momentum going right now.
