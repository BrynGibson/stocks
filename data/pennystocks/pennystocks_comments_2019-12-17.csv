If your nee focus on one industry and keep your % spread out. Dropping your whole investment in one area is definitely not good. Also if your new read up on shit and stay away from stocktwits until you can judge market sentiment etc. After that log on to there and basically go against everything they say lol. Or go on WSB and do the exact opposite of what they suggest.,2019-12-17
