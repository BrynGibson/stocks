Henderson, NV, June 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Readen Holding Corp. (RHCO.PK)¬†has decided to focus Hitting Media, the marketing software that was acquired recently, solely on its own e-commerce platforms.

Hitting Media BV specializes in targeted market advertising software developed in-house and successfully used in branding campaigns by renowned corporations such as McDonald‚Äôs and Shell as well as branches of the Dutch Government including the Police Force as well as the Ministry of Defense in order to deploy venue targeting during events.¬†

The use of this specialized software has resulted in a broad marketing reach at a vastly reduced cost due to the low CPM (cost per thousand impressions).

As of now¬†Readen Holding Corp. (RHCO.PK)¬†has decided to no longer offer these services for external customers but to focus them solely on its own e-commerce platforms concentrating on marketing and branding campaigns pertaining to ventures owned by Readen Holding Corp., enabling us to expand them at a much lower cost, deploying product offers with a higher conversion rate due to the enhanced targeting possibilities.

Quote Kok Wai Lee CEO of the company: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve finally been able to optimize the software to a point where we can use it easily and quickly for multiple marketing activities. We are currently planning a massive marketing campaign for our upcoming expansion towards the Asian market. Meanwhile we will continue deploying additional marketing activities through our Hitting Media software for our Neckermann and D5Avenue webshops.‚Äù

COSTA MESA, Calif., June 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a corporation specializing in manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, and the first publicly traded company in America whose primary focus is the production and sales of hemp-infused beer, announces it has signed a national agreement with Nine Band Brewing Company (‚ÄúNine Band‚Äù).¬† This new agreement vastly expands the production capacity for flagship brew Major Hemp HIPA, while extending the geographic reach and distribution footprint.¬†  


Nine Band Brewing Company is based in Allen, Texas, located just north of the greater Dallas area.¬† Its sprawling brewhouse spreads out over 5,000 sq. ft and boasts an annual capacity exceeding 10,000 bbls.¬† Nine Band produces a variety of beers including Brown Ale, Pale Ale, Hefeweizen, Kolsch, Stout as well as a bevy of unique brews such as Barley Wine and Honey Blonde.¬† Nine Band is owned and operated by Keith Ashley in partnership with head brewmaster, Ian Larson, who has traveled the world honing his award-winning brewing skills.¬† ¬†

Nine Band is licensed to sell beer in multiple states, which will enable Sipp Industries to expand Major Hemp HIPA into the biggest markets in America, including California, transforming the Company from a regional player into a truly national brand. Sipp Industries is finalizing the application process with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) which is the state agency that regulates all phases of the alcoholic beverage industry in Texas.¬†

President Ted Jorgensen, of wholly-owned subsidiary Major Hemp, stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic to be working with Keith and his team at Nine Band.¬† The Texas market is enormous and Nine Band has relationships with some of the largest distributors in the state.¬† We now possess the capabilities to expand nationally and are currently speaking with distributors in major markets about Major Hemp HIPA.¬† This is a monumental step for the company.‚Äù¬†

Sipp Industries and Nine Band are working together on crafting recipe and label submissions to the appropriate governing authorities.¬† Major Hemp HIPA is being placed on the production schedule for brewing this month.¬†
