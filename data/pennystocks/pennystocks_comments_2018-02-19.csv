3,Talonx4,duhebjc,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ykv9t/questions_on_day_trading/duhebjc/,1,"&gt;When I buy stocks on the OTC do I have to wait 3 days for the funds to be transferred to the pennystock company before I sell them? Or do share purchases/sales happen instantly, where I can then turn around and sell them after 2 or 3 ticks, and then wait 3 days for the funds to settle into my account before I can use my profit to trade again?

Instant purchase of stocks.  And you can so instantly as well.  If you are trading on a margin account, you can have instant funds again, but you will be limited by the PDT that only allows three day trades every 5 day period.   

If it's a cash account you have to wait for the funds to settle.  If you have over 25k invested, the pdt rule does not apply.   Some brokers bypass the rule like Ustocktrade where there is no wait time and instant settlement times.

&gt; Also do I NEED to have $25000 in my brokerage account to engage in this kind of day trading?

To make 4 day trades or over in a five day period yes you will need 25k.  Otherwise your broker may terminate your account.  

If you buy, that's one trade.  If you sell that's one trade.  However you can hold overnight and it will not be considered a day trade and will not count against your three trades.  ",2018-02-19

When I was younger I hated my job so much that I decided that if I ever worked for myself that I would be happy.  I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit stressful.  But much less than having a 9-5 job.  

I could take my family to Disney land any day I wanted and didn't have to worry about having a day job.  

The real problem is boredom and lack of responsibilities.  I have seen several day traders that are alcoholics.  It's easy to have a couple of drinks while trading and then it becomes daily, and then hourly, and before you know it, you are irishing up your coffee at 7am and you say ""well everyone does it"".   And then you realize that you don't act normal without it. And you have to drink to feel normal.  And then you realize one day as you are on your third beer in the shower at 6am, ""maybe I have a problem"".   If you don't realize it, you get bored and move on to harder things. 

You drive around the streets in a sports car or fast motorcycle and tickets don't mean anything to you.  You mouth off to the police because spending a night in jail has literally no consequences to you.  You are not going to get fired, you are not going to lose all source of income. You simply lose a day of trading.  

You begin to take your wife and kids for granted because they are always there.  Your kids are always screaming in the background.  The booze and adrenaline of watching stocks is in full force as your eight your old and your ten year old slam open your office door, fighting over a $5 plush bear.  As they are screaming you are softly whispering shhh... Shhh... Daddy is trying to work.  

The fight gets worse and your wife is nowhere to be found.  You are trying to time a sale perfectly to pull over 5k when your ten year old screams bloody murder because his little brother stole his bear.  

You leave the computer and run over and grab the bear so none of them get it.   And now all hell breaks loose.  Nobody is happy.  Both kids are screaming, your wife finally shows up late and says ""what did you do?""  

You mumble under your breath and head back to the computer and see that the stock hit that 5k mark, but then fell and you just lost 8k.   You look at that $5 bear....   And realize that $5 not only stopped you from gaining 5k. But that it lost you 8k.  

You swear, and as your wife is escorting two screaming kids out, she says ""really... Really... ""  

Most traders cross a point right here.  You either failed as a trader.  Or you failed as a parent and husband. You stare at that chart on your monitor and look over and there's that damn bear.. Staring back at you.  üêª   

The stress is different.  It's a constant balancing act.  You have to determine your limits and a person and you gave to be self disciplined.  Otherwise, it will get to you.  

As for capital, it depends.  I did well for 50k.  But as it grows, you just keep trading more and more.  I would say if you had 50k and knew your stuff you can double it in a year easily enough.  ",2018-02-19

I used to be able to pull 8% to 15% a day in my prime.  The problem was then I would get bored and take a month off to go to south America.  And then two weeks off for Vegas, and then a conference in LA.  

Car after car, house after house, and before you know it, even making 8% in a day isn't enough because you only sit down and try one day a month.  

It's not hard to find a stock that can get you 4% in a day.  The problem is that many young traders want that 35%-40% jump in a day.  They buy in when the stock is high, it goes a little higher, they sit on it, maybe put a stop loss in at what they bought for, and then it comes down and they sell losing money or walking away with no gain.  

They get in too late on a pump, and meanwhile plenty of stocks just pulled 4%.  Do it twice in a day and you hit 8%.

78,Baraxton,dumttwo,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ykr4g/how_many_of_you_use_trading_as_your_mainonly/dumttwo/,1,"I trade options as my primary source of income. It‚Äôs definitely nice having no one else to answer to but yourself. However, you must be very disciplined and treat it like a real job. I get up at 6am every day and workout before the market opens. If I‚Äôm able to net my daily profit quota, I spend the rest of the day reading, hiking , or writing. 

It‚Äôs not a life that is achievable for everyone because you really have to be confident in your abilities, develop an effective strategy and have the discipline to stick to it. 

I wouldn‚Äôt do anything else and I have many choices. Ability to travel is a nice perk, but most of my friends are unable to do so at the drop of a hat. I generally work around their travel schedules. 

It‚Äôs also a very lonely profession because you can‚Äôt really talk about your profits or losses with other people - they don‚Äôt understand how you could possibly make or lose in a day double what they make in a whole year. ",2018-02-19

For instance, I will sell a put spread on a stock I believe to be undervalued and use the proceeds to purchase a credit spread. I generally leg into my positions gradually, instead of all at once, meaning I‚Äôll purchase an OTM put, wait for the stock to dip, then sell an ATM or just OTM put for a large premium, using the proceeds to purchase the ATM or just OTM call. Once the stock moves up a bit, I‚Äôll sell the second leg of the call spread. 

Additionally, I only ever use 20% of my cash, deploying 15% in call positions on individual securities and 5% in put positions on the broad market. ",2018-02-19

83,levishazam,dusqzal,/r/pennystocks/comments/7ykr4g/how_many_of_you_use_trading_as_your_mainonly/dusqzal/,1,"I quit my job last year and focused on programming and investing full-time. Programming didn‚Äôt do well but Investing has really taken care of my fianc√© and I. We had about $35,000 (our savings) and we diversified it in ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin, and some blue chips, also I bought into HMNY quite low. We‚Äôve managed to both quit our jobs and travel the world. We‚Äôre in New Zealand now touring in a van, rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking. I would say... if you enjoy your job... don‚Äôt quit. But If you want to be independent, definitely quit and invest 50+ hours a week investing. You‚Äôll be much happier. I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a job, but the money wouldn‚Äôt matter, at this point it‚Äôs just to have purpose and feel satisfied. I think I‚Äôll do some social work. 

Also... great time to buy HMNY, should be at 20$+ soon. ",2018-02-19
