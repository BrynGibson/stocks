10,_LukeGuystalker_,fg3862a,/r/pennystocks/comments/ewjys5/simple_questions_january_31_2020/fg3862a/,1,"Don't bother with TSLA or other similar stocks right now.

Penny stocks are what you should be interested in right now (~ $10 and below). You wouldn't be able to afford a single share of TSLA right now, but you could potentially afford 100 shares of a penny stock, meaning you actually have a chance of making a profit. 

A user on here posts a watchlist each morning, masterthemarket is his YouTube channel. I highly recommend watching it. 

Also, browse YouTube for other investing related videos. Learn. Understand. Make sure you understand how candlesticks work and patterns to look for. 

As a new person, it's easy to look at a chart and be completely mind blown...but in reality, they really aren't that complicated once you realize what is actually on the screen. 

I recommend opening an account with TD Ameritrade. Its completely free and you do NOT have to trade through them. Only trade through Robinhood app so you don't have to pay commissions. Ameritrade account gives you access to their thinkorswim software though that allows you to scan the market. 

If you do that and want further help in how to use thinkorswim, feel free to reach out to me. I just started investing 3 weeks ago and have made enough profit this month to cover my mortgage and then some!

Good luck and remember, everyone loses trades here and there",2020-01-31

But if they jump then you could potentially see over 100% in returns. I made a lot on INPX when it soared but then got greedy a lost a lot. The thing with penny stocks is that you've got to do a lot of research, pay attention to news and volume and don't get left holding the bag. Most of the time you lose money because these companies are losing money. The stock market doesn't make millionaires over night. You have to play the long game. Look at where you would be if you invested in a company like Microsoft 5 years ago. You would of more then doubled your money. My advice, stay in safe stocks with most your money and use a little bit to gamble on penny stocks. Don't put all you eggs in one basket. You could see your 3000 dollars turn into 1500 in a day.",2020-01-31

What’s hard is standing by your money and letting the ceo and cfo do what they have to do instead of making their life harder and having to deal with stupid little pricks who just say some bearish shit when there’s actually a lot of evidence and constant press releases that should be positive. So yes it is completely different replies but take into account the amount of time spent with peoples post.,2020-01-31

89,Derp2638,fgirpb5,/r/pennystocks/comments/ewqcvh/smrt_buyout_for_90_cents_a_share/fgirpb5/,1,"I mean if you do the math for the agreement it’s pretty criminal. 

305 million in inventories -160 million in debt = 140 million.  Then in the said agreement founder Jay Stein gets to keep his shares which is 33% of the company. Also, IIRC he serves as a board member on the firm that bought them. 

The company as of recently has paying off debt quickly and without paying off the debt THAT the CEO/founder made when he made IIRC a special 5.00 dividend. Without this dividend that he took out debt for the company wouldn’t even be in a bad situation at all. Note I’m not a super long term holder but I digress. 

So 66% of 144 million = 95.4 million   The firm bought the public’s 30 million share float for 27 million at 90 cents a share with a premium of 24 cents since it was trading at 66 cents. 

Now I really don’t know much about lawsuits involving public companies, or how long they take but this is borderline bullshit what happened. Someone was manipulating the stock downwards too. 

I’m not even mad cause 90 cents was essentially my cost basis but I feel like we/I got fucking screwed and long term holders feel the same way.",2020-01-31
