16,A Rocket Science Solution To Lithium-Ion Battery Fires,aw5vxf,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aw5vxf/a_rocket_science_solution_to_lithiumion_battery/,6,4," 

I don't really drive enough to make an electric vehicle (EV) a compelling value proposition, but if my commute was a bit longer it is something I would seriously consider.

However, there is one aspect of EVs that makes me a little nervous. Although rare, lithium-ion batteries can fail, resulting in a fire. This fire can spread to other cells, and can ultimately explode in a thermal runaway. This slight risk would probably cause me to think twice about charging an EV in my garage at night.

There are potential solutions to this problem. Last year I wrote about [A Battery That Could Change The World](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/20/a-battery-that-could-change-the-world/), which was a story about the development of a solid-state lithium battery that won't catch fire if damaged.

However, today's lithium-ion batteries aren't going away anytime soon. So, one company has developed a potential solution to the fires that can be spawned from lithium-ion battery failures.

California-based [KULR Technology](https://kulrtechnology.com/), in partnership with NASA, has developed a product to stop lithium-ion battery packs from exploding in thermal runaway.

NASA is interested in this problem because of the potential for a catastrophic failure in space. A runaway thermal event from these batteries may be a low-probability event, but on a spacecraft or in a spacesuit, the consequences could be devastating.

The solution that has been developed involves the placement of a vaporizing thermal capacitor next to the individual cells. If a cell fails and the temperature starts to climb rapidly, the heat will be dissipated in the thermal capacitor. You can think of it as analogous to an electrical fuse that will fail to stop a surge of electrical current.

In addition to the thermal capacitor, which they call the HYDRA thermal runaway shield (TRS), each cell also contains a flame arrestor to block the fire from reaching surrounding cells. This solution prevents adjacent cells from rising above 100°C. This is important, because at temperatures above 130°C, the chance for a short in adjacent cells rises substantially.

You can see a demonstration of some early NASA tests with the TRS. In [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lVq7wmYp7mV3NDd0d3aGdGSjg/view), a failure is triggered in a single cell in a 50-cell pack. You can see the explosion at the 2:40 mark in the video. The temperature of the triggered cell reportedly rose above 1000°C, but neighboring cells all remained below 100°C.

There is certainly a need to get a better handle on understanding the root cause of these failures, because the number of these batteries in applications is growing exponentially. Even one failure in a billion is unacceptably high when there are billions of these cells in use.

As these battery packs become more powerful -- and because of the potential for high-consequence incidents like a fire on an airplane -- the need for fire suppression will grow. The long-range solution may be a new type of battery, but the solution developed by KULR and NASA could greatly enhance the safety of existing lithium-ion battery packs.

28,[TSXV] Good Life Networks [Ticker : GOOD],aw7549,Histamo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aw7549/tsxv_good_life_networks_ticker_good/,2,4,"Advertising companies do not get much love from investors as other technology companies do, but recent explosions in the stock price of ""The Trade Desk"" (Ticker : TTD) has definitely shed some light on how lucrative the industry really is. With \~77 million shares outstanding (fully diluted 93MM) and a market cap of \~$25 million, Good Life Networks (Ticker : GOOD) has stepped up to take on advertising giants such as Google and Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

So what does Good Life Networks really do? First off, they are an advertising company at heart, however their focus is on the creation of a high speed advertising exchange capable of machine learning. GOOD's platform offers value to two different parties - the publishers and advertisers. Publishers benefit from the exchange by being able to reach their target audience in a cost effective, safe and efficient manner. Advertisers benefit by reaching viewers that are much more likely to be interested in the ad.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value Proposition** 

* Speed of the exchange - \~117,000 decisions a second, 10 milliseconds to determine suitability of potential customer, and 200 milliseconds to deliver the advertisement (3x faster than Interactive Advertising Bureau standards @ 750 milliseconds).
* Privacy of customers - GOOD does not use personally identifiable information, which has been a hot topic surrounding Facebook and their recent allegations on not doing enough about the privacy of the customer.
* Brand safety for advertisers - GOOD's in-house algorithm checks the ad to ensure they are not fraudulent and ensure inappropriate ads not placed next to sensitive topics. In order to further increase the likelihood of a fraudulent ad reject, ads are also further subjected to screening by an independent third party. As a result, GOOD is able to screen out \~98% of fraudulent advertisements - well above the IAB standard of 90%)

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Good Life Networks is extremely undervalued relative to peers and it does not take much to realize the potential upside in stock price. To start off, the advertising industry is very cyclical in nature - with Q4 typically being the strongest quarter. Keeping that in mind, GOOD's Q4 financials are expected to be released in the coming weeks, which can be a potential catalyst for the stock price. GOOD recently reported their trailing 12 month revenue (Oct 1st 2017 - Sept 30th 2018) is $40.2 million and considering their significant year-over-year/quarter-over-quarter growth from prior reporting years (Q318 QoQ revenue 107% increase), we should see a pretty successful Q4 from GOOD. With a market cap of $25 million and 12 month trailing revenues at \~$40.2 million, I believe that the company is quite undervalued. I will not be doing a deeper dive into the financials besides going through the bare bones. Please conduct your own due diligence if you are interested in additional financial data points.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, finding a company that respects shareholder value is quite difficult these days, especially in the TSX Venture exchange. The CEO of the company has focused on maximizing shareholder value by minimizing dilution through stock issuance for their recent acquisitions. Rather than solely issuing stock, GOOD has been structuring deal terms that include a mix of stock issuance based on performance metrics and cash. To prove that they are able to pull this off, GOOD was able to secure a loan from one of the big 5 Canadian banks for $11.25 million dollars. This in itself is already very impressive, especially considering the fact that the company's market cap is a mere $25 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Please conduct your own due diligence if you are interested in the stock. As always, penny stocks always come with their risks and extensive research must be done before investing. There is quite a bit of information on GOOD and I highly recommend interested viewers to start off on their website and work their way from there. Note : I am sitting on a long position for this stock, with a time frame of \~2 years.
