Reason it’s hype:
Trump has made more news about how he doesn’t like where oil is going. But the Saudis are the only ones losing and they don’t seem to be willing to surrender anytime soon.

Reason it’s not hype:
The Saudis need to have barrels around 90$ which it’s way below whereas the Russians needed it at 20$ and it’s now barely below. In other words I think the Russians will now step in especially with Trump making speeches about it. But there’s no way the Russians are the ones surrendering it should be the Saudis but for some reason they’re not. 

So it may spike now then dip until a decision is made then start the real climb. Possibly. Nobody actually knows except maybe Trump and Putin.",2020-04-04

I cant tell you much about the company itself as I dont in particularularly care since I'm mostly here for the day trades however looking at the charts and history over the last little while makes me think the CEI run is not over yet. 
Yes it pulled back today but that's because of the large run it had earlier in the day. 
If it can hold this support I think itll run back to recent and possibly new all time highs. If it breaks this current support It may retrace all the way back to a 1.3 or 1 support and if it breaks that I would say it's dead in the water unless it has some substantial news.
