So you can buy today, sell tomorrow and it wont count towards the PDT rule. But honestly, starting out I wouldn't be doing more than a trade a day. Learn patterns, watch the news feed religiously, study past stocks that undergone a drastic swing and figure out what caused it. This shits addicting and your emotions will constantly tell you that your missing out on a great opportunity, which usually leads to a loss. Develop a criteria or strategy that a stock must meet before throwing money at it or if your playing a stock that's riding some news hype, learn to understand if that stock can sustain the price it will end up at or if it will bottom out. Another thing to remember is to compensate for the fees in your trade, TD is $6.95/trade so if you invest $100 in a stock it has to go up 14% just to break even. Good luck ",2019-03-14
