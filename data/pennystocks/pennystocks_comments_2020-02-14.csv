By staying busy and making fitness (not a healthy diet, just fitness) a more significant part of my life I have been distracted and am almost completely focused on getting rich, this makes me forget about nicotine. I still think about it, and I like vaping/smoking in general without a buzz or high, just for the process of blowing smoke, it's fun.
