They cannot afford P3 alone so they are at the very least getting a partnership with a larger pharma company. This was expected to be announced by the end of July but maybe they are waiting for Q2 reports. The fact that they missed their expectations with this means that they probably has a bidding war going on and 2 or more companies are fighting over this partnership. 

They have one other major drug to report P2 on. 

They said that they are launching another drug into trials but have not made the official announcement. This lack of PR suggests that they are waiting to just announce a lot of news all at once. I think this is the sexiest part of the company and why people are bag holding. Eventually the company will need to announce all this stuff and estimates are putting it around $1-$1.50. ",2018-08-03
