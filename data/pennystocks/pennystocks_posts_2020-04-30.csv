0,Exit plan for UAVS,gaskhx,SwimmingJunky,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaskhx/exit_plan_for_uavs/,1,9,What are all of you's exit plans for today?  I'm getting PTSD from DECN because I had put a stop-limit order like a good little boy but the drop was so fucking big in so fucking fast that it completely blew past it and never triggered at all.  I'm terrified a repeat of that is going to happen again today.,2020-04-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaskhx/exit_plan_for_uavs/
1,UAVS - Why it‚Äôs blowing up,gasjdr,icysauceman69,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gasjdr/uavs_why_its_blowing_up/,1,10,"For the past 4 days UAVS has been rumored to have landed a deal with Amazon. 

At first, it was just skepticism, due PR saying they received a ‚Äúpurchase order from a major ecommerce company. Representing significant new revenue....‚Äù

However, yesterday, a video was leaked early yesterday morning. It was an instructional video of how to unbox a new AGEagle drone. What makes this significant? 
1. The video starts with the logo of both companies AGEagle and Amazon side by side, implying collaboration.
2. The website it was found on was morganchillcott.com. She seems to make instructional video for companies as a hustle. 
3. The video was marked as unlisted meaning the only people who could view it at the time, were the people who were sent the link. 
4. Since the leaking, the video was not taken down. It‚Äôs just the privacy setting on the video was fixed to where no one could see the video. As a matter of fact you can‚Äôt even go to MorganChillcott.com as the website has currently been made private. The seems to have just been a mistake made on the video creators side of things 
5. The most important of all. Morgan Chilcott is the daughter of the founder of the company Bret Chilcott. You can see him in a family vacation video she has on her YouTube page. If you check her Facebook you can see she is from Neodesha, Kansas where the company was founded and is headquartered. It all checks out. Seems like her father wanted to give her another gig for her video making business. 

Now one could say this was just a move to pump their stocks. However, the video was uploaded in mid-February. Unless they were planning this all along for the past two months. Which seems a little far fetched. I imagine the daughter getting into trouble with the SEC for misleading investors or insider trading. Especially since she is the daughter of the founder of the company.

I‚Äôve also read things online about activity on the CEO Barrett Mooney‚Äôs LinkedIn page. That seems to be just skepticism. 

Another thing I haven‚Äôt read anyone talking about is, if they landed this deal with Amazon, how tremendous it would be to be the supplier of drones or drone parts to Amazon during the COVID-19 pandemic. A time when people want as little contact as possible with others in fear of contracting the virus. Seriously I think that is a huge deal. Which is why I bought 4000@.994.

12,AMPY - The power Penny,gaqr9y,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gaqr9y/ampy_the_power_penny/,1,41,"[Ampy Chart](https://ibb.co/zQSvH9D) 

Seems like energy is on the fly trends last week and this week. Not only that, but they've been keeping a steady consistency. I've been taking a look at AMPY that contains both a good consistency and after-hours activity. Opening broke all resistance from 0.97 &amp; original support was 0.91. I highly recommend looking for a re-entry point at 1.39 considering the volume for yesterday was soft at 3M. The gap has yet to be filled with a reasonable price target of $3 which is very ever so nice. Out of most of the tickers, this is by far a strong reasonable reputable energy company as well. Their quarter report makes up for the Q12020 and overall favorable.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

PB 0.05 ranked 11th which is incredibly good.

Reminds me of FCEL back in October 2019

Debt to asset 50% which is fair

Dividends which is also a plus

Overly sold more than 100%

Likely a continuation

Support 0.90

0.94 was the confirmation for a bullish cup'n handle that maintained a HODL.

[Robin Track seems to show a demand + Price Strength](https://ibb.co/3hK4tP2)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: 

Challenging resistance maybe 1.9 for it to break higher

Needs to break 1.7 for a confirmation

If the continuation isn't consistent, the fail-safe exit at most would be 1.3

Anyone think VAL is worth a few hundreds in hope it's last minute struggles will turn into tremendous gains?

Before you reply, I've checked the data for buy and sell and volume analysis... it looks like it's being pumped now with 700k buy and 300k sell, 400k buy and 200k sell, 600k sell and 100k buy... which drove the stocks from .41 close Wednesday to .44 AH.

OIL Moves Higher
 
GOOGL, TSLA, &amp; MSFT Blow Away Numbers
 
Russell the Big Winner
 
 
Today‚Äôs market got off to a dramatic start when already +200 in the futures, GILD came out with positive news on the NIAID trial for Remdesivir and we added an additional 250 to the open.  The Fed FOMC was a nonevent, but after the Q&amp;A, it became obvious that the money train would keep rolling, the Gold moved higher. The final numbers were impressive with DJIA +532.31 (2.21%), NASDAQ +306.98 (3.57%), S&amp;P 500 +76.12 (2.66%), the Russell, the big winner +62.68 (4.83%) and the DJ Transports +221.30 (2.63%).  Market internals were strong with NYSE 7:1 and NASDAQ 4:1 and for the first time in recent memory, volume was higher.  The DJIA was 24:6 with WMT the only double-digit loser -30 DPs while on the upside we had V +72, AAPL +62, AXP &amp; BA +53, and MSFT +52 (and more coming in the morning).

SECTORS: Earnings played a big part in today‚Äôs market.  After the close last night, we heard from Google and it was a beat on revenues and after closing $1232.59 -38.27 and finished the evening $1267 +35.  It continued higher today and finished $1345.02 +112.43 (9.12%).  After today‚Äôs close we heard from a few of the other FAANG names.  FaceBook was a miss both top and bottom but the guidance they gave on ad spending was upbeat.  After closing 194.19 +11.28 it to 214.57 + another $20.  MSFT beat on both numbers and after closing $177.43 +7.62 it shot higher to 186.52 before closing $181.25 + 3.82.  TSLA was the last one to report and the stock has been on a tear from a low of $350 in mid-March to close today $800.51 +31.39 and put out a profitable quarter and talked about it big truck.  The stock moved to $886.89 and closed $870.30 for a total gain of $101.88 (13.25%).
 
And, the HOMERUN OF THE DAY is clearly Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR)  reported that it had a 100% survival of its patients treated with CAP-1002.  All were in deep respiratory distress and 5 of the 6 were on ventilators.  Four of the six have already been discharged.  The stock, which has been reversed twice, most recently 1:10, and the last time 1:50 finished the day $8.50 +6.09 (252.7%) Clearly a home run.  But with a side note since the adjusted high after both reverses is $2,720.  Quite a destroyer of equity.
 
 
FOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN +.74, BGS -.75, FLO -.47, CAG -.19, MDLZ -.55, KHC +.81, CALM -.79, JJSF +10.71 (8.48%), SAFM -3.43, and LANC +3.09.
 
 
BIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB -.46, ABBV +1.20, REGN -17.26 (3.27%), ISRG +16.27 (3.23%), GILD +6.37, MYL +1.06, TEVA +.36, VRTX +1.54, BHC +.95, INCY -1.71, ICPT +1.07, LABU +1.36, and IBB $126.55 +1.74 (1.39%).
 
CANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.18, CGC +.46, CRON +.06, GWPH -.18, ACB +.01, PYX +.03, NBEV +.03, CURLF +.30 (6.67%), KERN -.21 and MJ $12.44 +.18 (1.47%).

RETAIL was HIGHER with WMT the big loser again -3.89 (3.04%), M +.26, JWN -.02, KSS +.66, DDS -.45, JCP -.017, TGT +.85, TJX +4.90 (9.98%), RL +2.53, UAA +.19, LULU +7.96, TPPR +1.24 (7.7%), CPRI +1.68 (11.17%), and XRT $37.92 +1.10 (2.99%).
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +112.43 (9.12%), AMZN +104.12 (4.5%), AAPL +13.72 (4.92%), FB +31.66 (17.31%), NFLX +8.68, NVDA +9.44, TSLA +101.80 (13.25%), BABA +7.15, BIDU +3.12, CMG +26.64, BA +9.65, CAT +5.28, DIS +6.51 (6.13%) and XLK $93.45 +5.25 (5.95%).
  
FINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS 5.49, JPM +3.71, BAC +1.31, MS +1.43, C +4.04 (8.56%), PNC +5.00, AIG +2.52 (9.97%), TRV +1.72, AXP +9.16 (10.39%), V +13.74 (8.02%) and XLF $23.38 +.66 (2.9%).
 
OIL, $15.06 +2.72. Oil was higher again today and seems to be making a decent show of making an important bottom. Tonight, it is higher again trading 15.95 +.89.  The stocks were also much higher with gains of between 6% on the big names and as much as 30% on some of the small ones.  XLE closed $39.95 +3.77 (5.63%).
 
METALS, GOLD: $1,713.40 -8.80. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We have spent the last 3 days consolidating the gains and hit $1,720 today.  I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday I was a buyer.  We took the downside move this morning and averaged down @ $1.06, and they closed $1.61.  We are also long NEM.
 
BITCOIN: closed $8825 +1045. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today‚Äôs action was a continuing move higher.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.60 +1.20 today.
 
 
Tomorrow is another day.

54,Hey guys what do you think of Slang worldwide?,gam9h0,YUFALLING4IT,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gam9h0/hey_guys_what_do_you_think_of_slang_worldwide/,1,1,"Ticker is SLNG üá®üá¶ SLGWF üá∫üá∏


I would like some input on my new purchase.   I am new to the world of penny stocks (started Monday) and I hope you like my pick and buy.  This company got my attention  because recent increase in volume.



*About the company:* SLNG a US based cannabis CPG company.  The main strategy is to buy proven high demand brands in highly competitive markets and put those brands through their network of 3000 retailers.


Market cap is 26 million.  They reported they have 10 million in cash.  Have since raised 17 million and 4.5 million coming from deal closing.  So total cash position is over 30 million.   Revenue was 27 million last quarter. 


__________________________________


*Competitive advantage:* Cannabis companies burn through money because expansion is expensive.  Main cost are setting up growing and retail operations.


SLNG has no growing operations or retail  stores.  They buy cannabis, process, package and distribute brands.  These brands have risen to the top in cut throat mature markets and acquired by SLNG.  


They are also global with their vape hardware business.  Firefly for dry herb and O.PenVape for oils (#2 top selling brand of almond time)


_______________________________



*Partnerships:*  Canopy growth.  They have a joint venture in Canada together.   Canopy also owns warrants in SLNG.  


Trulieve,  TRUL is very highly regarded in the USA cannabis space.   Probably top 3 company in the USA.


They have several other partnerships like Cookies (best brand in the world IMO).   Cookies is the only brand they don't own they just distribute.


___________________________________



*Management:*  The company is run by 2 young guys who built #2 cannabis company in Canada and sold it in 2015.  They seem like very smart and honest guys who don't hype their stock unfortunately (unlike me).



_________________________________


*Possible Red flags:*  I found they have some cheap paper when the company was smaller in 2017.  Shares at 0.05 cents.  


I don't think this is a problem because in 2019 they hit 2.90 a share and I am sure the paper has been  flushed out.  If you didn't sell in the high 2 dollar range why would you sell in the 11 to 13 cent range. 


Management voluntarily entered into a lock up agreement until September (stock was 80 cents at the time)


The other red flag is selling pressure.  SLNG has not popped like most other cannabis stocks.   Could be a laggard play  due to someone unloading a large position.  Why?  



_______________________________



*Comparables:*  There is only one other major cannabis CPG company in the USA,  that company is called Origin House   


That company sold in January for 1.1 BILLION.  They have similar revenue to SLNG but SLNG had better financials.  *SLNG trading at 36 million.*

Each post made on the tickers I find likely valuable will be posted below each post. I sincerely hope I have helped many go green, practice, improve, and understand without having to hold people's hands (don't be the person to ask for a fish, BE the FISHER!). In short, I apologize if I don't respond apologize often enough of the common questions I receive whether to advise hold or sell; the reason being is I don't want to give a FOMO, I don't want to give someone a sense of regret, the only some form of safeguard I could give is providing simple resistance/support and reminding you effortlessly to follow self common sense not to be too greedy, or holding longer than normal.

I'm in no way shape or form a professional trader or a legally advised pro trader that can't promise loss or gains, but what I am good at in general is analyzing potential. For that, I hope 

These two charts I use are to study gap/swing/outside bars the other is to follow the art of Fibonacci which comes from Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo who was a mathematician. I've tested so many tools and so many that failed. At the end of the day... the chart set up works that help me give a clear insight if it's worth playing the flip coin or not; no emotions, no worry, just set it and let it bake mentality. The idea of day trading can be stressful which instead I've devoted the simplicity of reviewing activities via midnight - aka thinkorswim aka Ameritrade. It's clean, simple, and gives me all the time needed to review and pinpoint potential runners affirming the move before it happens, NOT after.

The reason I don't focus on OTC/OTK because well it's just from personal experience. There's absolutely no insight about any sort of confirmation unless it's a valuable press release source such as FDA, a buy out point of interest such as apple or people's gas, or even goverment related.

In short, I thank you all for following me. I thank you all for the kind words giving me that innovation enjoyable push. Below, feel free to drop a tax-deductable donation &lt;3

https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/g9yq5e/ozsc_power_conversion_technologies_inc_reverse/

The high volume the last two trading days has shown that this stock is gaining notoriety, either through pumpers, scanners or posts like this. Needless to say, diluters are taking advantage of the volume, and shares are being added aggressively to the OS count. Just today, about ~6m shares were added, bring the estimate to 115m total OS. According to John from The Waypoint Refinery (IR firm), there remains one DPA to be signed and executed before all dilution is frozen.These notes are assigned to CareBourn Capital, and until debt is paid off or DPAs are signed, the pps will continue to get crushed as buyers absorb these new shares. I trust that the IR firm is working hard to stop this dilution and promptly, as Brian Conway (CEO of Ozop Surgical and The Waypoint Refinery) has stated he is aiming for 100-120m OS. All we can do is wait for an 8K announcing the DPAs, and buy low while we can. 

I will continue to add, as these prices are ridiculously low compared to the potential, and the OS is still low enough to warrant my short term price target of &gt;0.10. The volume these past few days has made it clear that this thing can and will run, and keeping up with dilution necessitates eating up more shares. It doesn't feel good to be absorbing this debt, but I'm playing the game. 

Worst case scenario I can see this OS going to 200m shares. It is common in the OTC world for retail traders to pay for the company's debt through dilutive financing, however after the whole $ELTZ debaucle, I don't think Brian or John from Waypoint want this going that far. They have a responsibility to uphold the already good reputation of a solid company, and want to grow their own firm for the future. They want to represent solid companies, and treat shareholders well so their own reputation as an IR firm can transfer to new clients. It makes very little sense for these guys to risk what they are trying to build. That being said I keep the possibilities open. CareBourn Capital (debt lenders) very well could take their sweet time with their legal staff, diluting away.

Testing needs to be ramped up in a serious way, and we the people should be able to test ourselves. Because then it becomes our civil duty that if we‚Äôre able to bear with the symptoms without being hospitalized, for those who are severely at risk like my mother with Crohn‚Äôs disease, are able to self isolate ourselves with a tool that will guarantee you do not have this virus. I have personally know 2 people that got the virus and how quickly it accelerated to death. This is a very strange thing that no one understands why yet, and as states open because economic failures are going to happen in so many sectors, as they are already, more and more deaths are going to appear all over the country. Because there is no vaccine yet, but we‚Äôre working on it with the most brilliant minds which is great but realistically it‚Äôs going to be 7-12 months without it. Now I‚Äôm not here saying that Decision Diagnostics is the ‚Äúbest test in the world,‚Äù BUT it‚Äôs solution of the idea that you can take the virus onto a level of percentage in the bloodstream, similarly like you take the level of insulin. Until that meter reads 0% you should self isolate.

[TTI Chart 1 Outside Bar &lt;3](https://ibb.co/mR5vsRS)

[Chart 2 RobinTrack Supply/Demand](https://ibb.co/fGLDWSj)

[Chart 3 Oversold Proof / HODL](https://ibb.co/PwHbrnT)

So much to say about this. Plenty of room for open opportunity to get into. Highly affordable, support has been consistent at 0.25, broke resistance near closing, and after-hours (0.31). The chart has a gap chance of 0.80+. I'd love to truly be intrigued to get into asap confidently to measure a nova breakout around 0.48. Examining the candles on the left chart, we see a high rise of interest peaking since we all know at this point oil/gas is on the rise for demand eventually should the economy re-open again to its normal flow.

&amp;#x200B;

What is TTI?

An oil &amp; gas company that focuses on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, production well testing, production, offshore rig cooling, &amp; compression services and equipment.

What's their future? Risk of de-list?

Interestingly enough, the NYSE is being generous extending their continuation multiple times, so I don't see these guys going anywhere.

Legit company?

Yes, though slightly struggling they're a renowned necessity as a global business and address/company contact seems to be legit upon doing a little research.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

At one point, EPS was consistent on the rise for four quarters.

Cheap.

PB: 1.06 again, another perfect analyst intriguing ratio in trader's eyes.

PE -0.27 (just about right which is a perfect signal for entry).

Oversold.

Refuses to drop bellow 0.25 (support).

Cons:

Q1 2020 resulted in dagger fall in the chart. However, this leads to an open opportunity for a swing trade.

Debt to asset ratio of 87.20% though not horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best entry? 0.30 to 0.25.

So here's some DD! 

Draganfly (DFLYF) is the oldest drone manufacturer in the world and last week they started a historic partnership with Vital Intelligence and the University of South Australia to conduct pandemic flight tests in Connecticut - the first of its kind in North America.

The stock itself has dipped fairly hard since its peak last week, but it is picking up momentum now. The reason I believe it is a great time to get in is because of their shareholder update call tonight. You can find info about that here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html)

Additionally, earlier today they announced that they had acquired Dronelogics. Dronelogics as a drone company has been in business for 10 years, working closely with large multinational companies to provide insights into inventory metrics, asset management, volume-metric calculation and digitizing assets, among many other applications.

Historically, the stock has surged when PR/shareholder calls have come up. We're seeing increased volume the past two days and for the TSX ticker there's a huge sell wall at .85. Once that breaks it'll be a nice ride up. Granted, anything can happen.

I managed to swing trade a bit today but I'm in heavy again. Since the shareholder call takes place after market closes, I think it's better to be in than out for the open tomorrow!

All that said - DO YOUR OWN DD. Don't rely on other people to do that for you. If you feel fairly confident - then go for it. Personally I think that this is a sure thing and I will be looking to sell off around 15/20% profit. I don't play pennystocks for more than a few days, tops.

Dear Shareholders: 

RE: Merger 

As we previously shared via our Corporate Twitter account, The  Covid-19 Pandemic had a direct impact on the timeline of the  negotiations and pending transaction with the Private Equity represented  Merger Candidate. Throughout this unfortunate pause we continued to  coordinate with our advisors and representation of all parties involved  to assure the opportunity would remain active moving forward. 

We are pleased to announce the process has been restarted with a  target date to have a Letter of Intent (LOI) secured on or before May  29th with closing of the transaction before the end of June. The  adjusted timeline is at the request of the Merger Candidate so as to  secure two final agreements prior to the transaction. The Covid-19  situation that has impacted the world has ironically created an  opportunity to restart the process sooner than was anticipated as Global  M&amp;A for the most part had been suspended.",2020-04-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb0uor/paso_patient_access_solutions_inc/

during the conference cal, UAVS announced that they were in kahoots with a ‚Äúlarge e-commerce company‚Äù, while they didn‚Äôt name specifically amazon, amazon is in fact a large e-commerce company.

Amazon has a conference call later today where id argue (playing around with the idea) that they‚Äôll may announce the partnership to hype up their achievement or future in drone delivery. Considering they are the bigger company I‚Äôm sure the news coming from them would be better received then from a small company.

\-HQ is in some small suburb of Boston, the office building looks legit, but nothing fancy.

\-The recent ""Ferrari"" deal is not directly with Ferrari but its some contract to use their HD video systems to film some race series tangentially related to Ferrari, this technology is not new for them

\- its mostly a military contractor, but I suppose they are trying to dabble/cash in on covid a little.

\-Their main business is NOT drones, but I suppose they are one of many companies now trying to cash in on the FAA waiver for covid.

\- I dont see any contracts or news directly linking them to any covid drone deals

Their primary product, a drug called Tavalisse treats Chronic immune thrombocytopenia, a horrible autoimmune disorder. Rigel is partnered with Grifols($GRFS) and together they're releasing Tavalisse into Europe in a year, and once this happens, Rigel triggers a 20 million dollar payment from their partner Grifols. When this drug drops into Europe, we can expect the 20 million to help clear up any outstanding debt(which happens with R&amp;D) and they can start clearing more profit from the drug alone and put more money into other ventures.

We've also seen a company this week that is linked to Rigel announce a Corona virus recovery treatment that is being fast tracked to approval in the UK([Here](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/uks_new_covid-19_trial_initiative_fast-tracks_bergenbios_bemcentinib_1339339)), Bergen Bio and their drug Bemcentinib was actually developed by Rigel and licensed from Rigel, and earns a **35%** royalty on its uses due to a 2011 agreement([Here](https://www.rigel.com/pipeline/partnered-assets/bergenbio/)). What does this mean? Further profit, lower debts, and as we all know what happens with any COVID news, the share prices can moon once the market reflects this data. Rigel is a relatively small stock, which related to the bigger winner here Bergen Bio, but still this will show us positive effects in terms of income and likely news once this conference call occurs on **May 5th Tuesday after market close**.

# Who thinks this is worth buying?

JP Morgan set a price target of **7$** for RIGL, the price has run **up 16%** roughly as of this writing the past week in expectation of positive earnings news, and **84% of the company is owned by institutional investors**, guys who do this for a living, with FMR having 13.55% ownership, Wellington at almost 10%, Blackrock with 8.73%, and Vangaurd at 5.24%. Regardless of your price target, this company sees promise in the eyes of large institutions, and you should see it too.

# What should you do?

Buying and holding shares is one route, another route is doing the longest dated calls, as they're very cheap at the moment, at the current prices, they're a steal, you always have the choice to exercise them, and this is a cheap way to get in now. 

Bonus points: They are in a good position for a buyout as well due to their method of treating thrombocytopenia being one method that can be rotated with others for most efficiency in treating their condition([Here](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/23/what-company-will-eli-lilly-buy-next.aspx))

# TL;DR Rigel is accumulating more income in the next year from Tavalisse with a Europe release, a drug it produced and has royalties on is being fast tracked for COVID-19 treatments, and big investors see potential. All of this with a conference call coming up on May 5th.",2020-04-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb59g8/the_play_rigl_or_rigel_pharmaceuticals/

228,"UAVs &amp; Amazon ""Proof"" that I've been able to put together",gb50s1,StreetTripleRider,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gb50s1/uavs_amazon_proof_that_ive_been_able_to_put/,1,41,"So I'm putting ""proof"" in quotes because obviously there's nothing of the sort here but there's something odd going on:

1. This is a verified quote taken from the AgEagle website:

&gt; ""announced the expansion of scope for its contracted commercial drone work through the receipt of follow-on purchase orders from a major ecommerce company. Representing significant new revenue, the new purchase orders relate to the continued manufacturing and assembly of drones used for the testing and refining of the client's commercial drone small package delivery vehicles, systems and operations currently in development.""

2. Price skyrocketed in anticipation of the rumours being confirmed on the call today and then tanked when the company didn't mention it at all.

3. A video was found circulating (unlisted on youtube) of an instructional nature  showing how to safely unbox the drones with both the amazon and AgEagle logos, it was allegedly posted on Feb 20th but as the video is down now I can't provide proof of the timestamp, I found this date in a yt comment on a mirror upload video.

I made a shitty screen recording of the mirror before it got removed, you can watch it at 2x speed [here](https://streamable.com/lhorxp) (it's super boring - which imho boosts its legitimacy).

An interesting note about the video other than the obvious amazon logo is the copyright at the end, ""Morgan Chilcott"" who appears to be the daughter of the founder and ceo up until recently.

4. Morgan Chilcott is self-discribed as ""[she] is a visual artist, videographer, photographer, sculptor, editor, designer, and all-around creative."" on her websites' meta data, which is now completely shutdown, see for yourself: https://www.morganchilcott.com/

I was able to find [a screenshot](https://imgshare.io/image/screenshot-20200429-114505-chrome.zbqc6) someone else took of her portfolio before the site went down showing she was the original uploader of the video. My own opinion here is she thought it was harmless and wanted to add it to her portfolio, people found it, combined it with the obvious rumors already circulating and the stock skyrocketed. 

My own takeaway is, this all looks pretty legit and they likely can't talk about it due to NDAs tied to their purchase orders. The video was accidentally leaked by the CEOs daughter and shit hit the fan, the company is now issuing DMCA take-downs left and right to try and plug the leak(s), quite successfully up until now I'd say...

Could this all be an elaborate pump and dump scam? Yes, but the super boring nature of the video and the lack of any marketing finesse would make this a very sophisticated and subtle fraudster. Looks far more like an honest accident to me.  What we do know for sure is the company has legit orders from a ""major ecommerce company"" so even if the video is fake, there's still some substance here.

 "" On March 8, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended complaint in an ongoing civil action in which the SEC alleges that numerous individuals and associated entities participated in microcap schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales. 

On February 6, 2019, the SEC obtained final consent judgements as to Miami-based investor Mark Groussman; Melechdavid Inc., a company of which Groussman is President; and **Alpha Capital Anstalt**, a Lichtenstein-based hedge fund.""

They're the oldest drone manufacturer in the world and last week they started a historic partnership with Vital Intelligence and the University of South Australia to conduct pandemic flight tests in Connecticut - the first of its kind in North America. 

The stock itself has dipped fairly hard since its peak last week, but it is picking up momentum now. The reason I believe it is a great time to get in is because of their shareholder update call tonight. You can find info about that here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draganfly-host-virtual-only-shareholder-190010557.html)

Additionally, a few hours ago they announced that they had acquired Dronelogics. Dronelogics as a drone company has been in business for 10 years, working closely with large multinational companies to provide insights into inventory metrics, asset management, volume-metric calculation and digitizing assets, among many other applications.

Historically, the stock has surged when PR/shareholder calls have come up. We're seeing increased volume the past two days and for the TSX ticker there's a huge sell wall at .85. Once that breaks it'll be a nice ride up. Granted, anything can happen. 

I managed to swing trade a bit today but I'm in heavy again. Since the shareholder call takes place after market closes, I think it's better to be in than out for the open tomorrow! 

All that said - DO YOUR OWN DD. Don't rely on other people to do that for you. If you feel fairly confident - then go for it. Personally I think that this is a sure thing and I will be looking to sell off around 15/20% profit. I don't play pennystocks for more than a few days, tops.
