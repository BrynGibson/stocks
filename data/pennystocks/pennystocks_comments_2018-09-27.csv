So for instance, #XYZ has some decent fundamentals and is coming up on a resistance or support price point. Let‚Äôs say that price point is 4.50$. It‚Äôs next point of hard resistance is 5$ So my price targets are:

Resistance: 4.50$
Entry point: 4.60$
Exit 1: 4.95$
Exit 2: 5.20$
Stop loss: 4:37$

That stop loss is arbitrary in this but say it‚Äôs because there is a support line at 4.40$.

So you make your plan because you believe there is enough increasing volume, news, etc. showing that there would be a good chance it‚Äôll break that 4:50$ price point and keep going. I‚Äôm a believer in confirmation first so I wait till 4.60$ to buy in because I want to make sure it‚Äôs not a fakeout and it really is breaking out. But if it goes up, I buy in, it slows and dumps I have my stop set already and I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. It can skip over but I normally do trailing % stops based on levels of support so that negates that worry.

The problem with someone telling you to average down is you‚Äôve already failed being a trader by holding long enough to need to do so. Remember, this is trading, not investing. If you‚Äôre fundamentally investing buy and hold, you have convictions and hopefully you‚Äôve done enough research to know that this stock will go up eventually. I am talking about day trading or swing trading or any less than a month hold trading. With small stocks like marijuana stocks NOBODY knows what will happen. Pot could be legalized tomorrow but that company may have had a violation with the rules and can‚Äôt operate so boom. Stock plummets. That‚Äôs why you have to have rules.

Stocks don‚Äôt always go up and keep going. Biotech stocks upon FDA approvals will pop then drop, then consolidate, then rise, rise and keep rising. Trust me. Look at VCEL - fda approval took it from 2.99-$5 overnight. A few months later it was lower than 2.99, then sales started coming in and now its near $15 two years later. So for Avita Medical - it‚Äôs not a scam, trust me that dude is an idiot - but there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôs going to rise. You need to understand that under $5 no big institutional investor will buy this. It needs to be over $5 for them to even consider it. It‚Äôs like an unspoken rule. You also need to wait for the BARDA 60 million to come through - it will be above $5 within a year so just be patient. The fourth quarter is coming up, which means WINTER. What is this company selling? Burn care! When do most people get burnt? Winter. Bingo. So there approval is perfect timing. Historically, burn companies have their strongest quarters in winter.
