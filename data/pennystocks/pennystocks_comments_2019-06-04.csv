There is no “one way to find the next big penny stock”. You need to worry about mastering many skill sets, not worry about finding one stock. Many resources are out there. But like anything else, to really get good at something, it takes 1000’s of hours of learning. Good luck. 

Most important tips:

Assume every penny stock is manipulated, because every single one is. This is the beauty of penny stocks because stock market manipulation = market inefficiencies. And when there are market inefficiencies, the market becomes much easier to predict (compared to the big boards, where there are more stringent regulations, therefore less manipulation, less market inefficiencies, and less predictable). 

Assume 99% + of penny stocks are pump and dumps (manipulated upward with the intent of selling the stock at an overvalued price). Learn to profit from the PREDICTABILITY of this type of manipulation.

The other 1% (made up number) that I speak of are the true gems. The dump and pump scams. These are the companies that have true intrinsic value, but are being manipulated downward with the intent of acquiring the stock at an undervalued stock. 
 
Timing is very important. Learn about it.",2019-06-04

If a 100 billion dollar cap company goes up 300% it added 300 billion in value. Not easy to increase you intrinsic value by 300bil with one move. 

On the other hand, for a stock with a 1 million dollar market cap, going up  300% means only gaining 3 million in value. Well, that’s not that much. A small change in expected CRI for a company that is a going concern can add 3 million in economic value easily. It’s not that much. So really when you are looking at how big a move a stock has made, you should just look at value added, not a % move. 

The % tells you how much money you made, yes, and penny stocks can go up by large amounts more easily, yes, because they’re more risky/volatile and the same volatility applies on the downside. So for analyzing returns in a portfolio the % move is relevant. 

But when you’re analyzing why a company went up by X amount, it really is better to just look at the net economic value added. And in that context, the stock didn’t go up by that much , not as much as 300% “sounds like” in the context of larger cap stocks. 

Anyway, as for WHY this company went up , I have no idea. My only point was that, whatever happened, the EVA was not that small and the IV didn’t go up by that much.
