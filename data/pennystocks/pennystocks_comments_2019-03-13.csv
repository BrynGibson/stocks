Or loosing 99% on a penny stock. Or having a stock go up 40% and knowing to sell before the hype fades.

Realized gains are underrated. You likely got back in early enough for serious gains if the prospects of the company prove resolute.

Things can easily go the other way on a guy and wipe out profits of yours or put you in a losing position. I've been trading stocks (I also have long term investments of course but I trade frequently) for some time and one of the turning points when I really started understanding where i belong in the market was being able to take money off the table. I'm in long term positions that I also add to and swing trade a portion of, and sometimes I sell into a run and it continues to go up afterward. It's no biggie. 

The markets essentially have an unending supply of opportunities to profit from, don't worry. Look around and learn. There are many many opportunities that you are able to capitalize on and then miss afterward.... or only capture a portion of.... It's okay. Many times I have also sold for a healthy but conservative profit to see the stock plummet shortly thereafter, making out like a bandit while others cry about losses. So try not to beat yourself up.

Like one of AMD and one of Boeing and one of Apple. That way you're not risking much but you are emotionally invested. Use paper trading at td ameritrade and learn how to use the software. I would slowly increase your share size over time at robinhood when you start making money. Save brokerage fees for later at td when you're more serious and making big money. You can short at td and also make faster trades there when you really know what you're doing. ,2019-03-13

If there is a massive drop then you would have missed the trade on TD Ameritrade as soon as you saw it anyway. You can always trade with limits meaning that it will not go above or below the value you are willing to pay.

 It is a great place to start and learn how to trade without emotions. It is easier because the trades are free so you can learn to get out your early frustrations at your mistakes without paying someone to essentially profit while inexperienced.

Try playing poker with friends with no buy in then a buy in game at a casino. You will learn that you should fly by the seat of your pants less if it is real money. It is harder to learn this without experiencing it.

How charts work and what to keep an eye out for
Trading psychology

Sign up for thinkorswim paper money and take advantage of their charts. Also, someone can correct me if I am wrong, but I think TD will still charge a transaction fee after you have 25k in the account. When you have 25k it just means you can day trade. Without 25k in the account if you buy or sell a security within one day more than 3 times in a period of a week (5 business days) you get locked out of day trading completely for a period of time(that is how it works with Robinhood and I believe it is the same).

A lot of people are right about paper trading, make sure you have real time data on your paper account and loose the fake money first, if you can't make money in the simulator then don't put up real money.
