12,The ways to be a versatile trader in 2018.,8udngu,maddy_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8udngu/the_ways_to_be_a_versatile_trader_in_2018/,0,1," What are the best **penny stocks** to buy today? This is the sort of question I get every day, but it’s a trick question as the answer changes on a day to day basis, and sometimes can shift drastically during the course of a single day. You constantly have to be on top of your studying and research to figure out the answer and trust me, it helps ***BIGTIME*** to get mentored on the process in my trading challenge.

Here, I’ll dish on some tried and true steps that you can take to determine what penny stocks are worth your time on any given day, if you want more details read this new book and also watch [this free penny stock guide](https://inpennystock.com/webinarsignupyt/) ASAP. By asking yourself these questions, you can better determine the best penny stocks to buy today.

**1. Do you know what you’re doing?** Before you can pick the best penny stocks to buy today, be truly honest with yourself…do you know what you’re doing? Do you understand how and why stocks move, how to read a stock chart, and how to research catalysts and volume? Remember, it’s okay not to know much or even anything, my trading challenge teaches the most basic stuff, but it’s those basics that are crucial to your eventual success in an industry where 90&amp;#37; of traders lose money!

 If you don’t know these penny stock basics, then you have bigger things to think about than what penny stocks to trade. You need to figure out how penny stocks work, period. I know it might not be any fun, but it’s important to learn the basics before you start trading; otherwise, you’ll basically be gambling with your hard earned cash.

**2. Are you prepared?** Are you mentally prepared to trade? I mean that in a literal sense. If you’re waking up 5 minutes before the market bell, you’re far more likely to make mistakes. Do yourself the service of giving yourself time to be prepared for the trading day ahead. It is a millionaire habit that makes a big difference.

I’m extremely enthusiastic about waking up early. It gives you a chance to get various tasks out of the way and to do some research so that when the market opens, you’re mentally prepared to trade. Being in the right mindset will help prevent you from making dumb decisions in trades, which means fewer losses.

**3. What’s going on in the market?** Before zeroing in on specific penny stocks, consider the market at large, as it is right now. For instance, if the market is slow, you might not find many spiking stocks or big gainers. You can’t force the market to function how you want it to, so don’t try. It’s better to go with the flow so use [this tool](http://stockstotrade.com/) daily and stay updated with the hottest stocks.

Sometimes, the answer to “what are the best penny stocks to buy today?” is simply none of them. Let the market dictate that: never try to force a trade. It usually won’t end well if you try to make it happen!

**4. What stocks are gaining in volume?** Looking at a stock’s volume is important in determining whether or not it is worth trading. The volume can be determined fairly easily: just look at amount of shares being traded throughout the course of the day. Look at the volume of both buy and sell orders. If the action is high in either direction, the higher the volume of the stock. A high volume stock is simply one that is being traded in large amounts, whether it’s going up or down.

As I said, the high or low volume of a stock can help you decide whether or not a trade is a good move for you. To offer an example: say you see a stock trading with high volume. You can then determine that it’s worth looking at further, because the more movement there is around a stock, the higher the demand. Looking carefully at a stock’s movement should be a big part of your research when choosing which stocks to buy on any given day.
