7,Marijuana Stock Investors Identify New Opportunities As D.C Mayor Introduces Bill To Legalize Recreational Cannabis Sales,bv7wdx,DRay82,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bv7wdx/marijuana_stock_investors_identify_new/,102,18,"Residents can now plant and possess up to three ounces of cannabis legally. However, they cannot legally purchase pot, and the city cannot tax sales because of a provision in the federal budget that prohibits the District from enacting or enforcing marijuana legalization laws. What stocks do you think might benefit the most from this?

&gt;This also doesn‚Äôt avoid the fact that the US legal marijuana industry is rapidly expanding. Many states now focus on not only taking in taxes from dispensary sales but from other means as well. And a growing demand is, of course, creating new opportunities for businesses and investors alike. Take, for instance, the delivery niche in the industry. Once a taboo subject, a few public companies are legitimizing a move toward delivery. This could rapidly expand the industry as a whole.",2019-05-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bv7wdx/marijuana_stock_investors_identify_new/

10,Question for more experienced traders regarding selling shares at higher PPS,bv15fo,el_rico_pavo_real,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bv15fo/question_for_more_experienced_traders_regarding/,3,3,"It just occurred to me that selling millions of shares at a higher PPS is not as easy as it seems...

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say hypothetically I own 5,000,000 shares purchased at 0.0003 and a particular stock runs to, oh let's say 0.018? What strategy is best to liquidate and take profits without ruining the PPS? Obviously you cant just blast all the shares with a sell order at one time, but when volume goes from hundreds of millions per day at lower levels, to tens of thousands  per day at a higher PPS it almost  seems like it would be hard work to liquidate all of the shares with ""finesse"".

16,Why do penny stock traders care more about percentage gain than dollar gain?,bv9c2z,fxcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bv9c2z/why_do_penny_stock_traders_care_more_about/,0,38,"If  stock A moves $2 to $10, sure thats a good percentage gain. Then there is stock B, if it moves $30 to $40, it may not have good %gain but it terms of dollar gain it moves way more than stock A.

Now profits/loss \[P/L\] is determined by dollar gain, by how many dollars the stock has moved since you bought it, correct? So in this example surely stock B is more profitable since it moved $10 vs $8 by stock B. So this bring me to amy question why penny stock traders dont seem to obsess over %gain in penny stocks but big stocks do move a lot in dollar gain but not in %gain.",2019-05-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bv9c2z/why_do_penny_stock_traders_care_more_about/
