&gt;but i'm damm sure it will grow in the next 2 years.

I'm hoping this is nothing but a selling point rather than a plea for others to follow suit in your investment. This stock is an absolutely ludicrous investment.",2019-08-18

This is not only a total guess, but one that makes no sense. The 2.50 rule prevents short sellers from being able to short stocks like these, at least to any significant degree. Since AABB is valued at a cool $0.0073, that would mean for 1000 shares, you'd be purchasing $7.30 worth of stock. In this case, a short-seller would then need $2500 in equity.

Let's do some math:

AABB trades at 800,000 volume during the last intraday

In the most optimistic circumstances, let's say 30% of all volume is short. 

That would mean 240,000 of shares would be short sellers. Now with that in mind. Each of the short sellers accounts are different. I'd presume those who short this, which is limited to non-existent at best, would need accounts that can purchase an adequate amount of shares on this stock, while also conforming to the 2.50 rule.",2019-08-18

Since this is your 10th post on AABB in the past few months, with no spikes at all in any of those time frames, I'll presume you're stuck in a bad position, and desperately want this thing going higher. Bail on this idea. You're wasting your money, effort, and time.

I'd presume those who short this, which is limited to non-existent at best, would need accounts that can purchase an adequate amount of shares on this stock, while also conforming to the 2.50 rule. 10,000 shares shorted would equate to about $73, and need at least $25,000 in their account to execute the trade. In other words, someone who's getting short would be trying to make at best $73 on a $25,000 account, or 0.3%.

This is why the odds are unbelievably against you long term with these types of plays. Everyones going long with the same idea: make money and get out. I'm shocked how someone could even find this rewarding and delude themselves into believing there's any legitimacy behind their own fantasies. ""Shorts will race to cover"" is absolutely ludicrous.",2019-08-18
