0,Can I get some opinions on ATOS for tomorrow?,7xeysj,CAP034,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7xeysj/can_i_get_some_opinions_on_atos_for_tomorrow/,1,6,"ATOS has been on an uptrend for a while. Looking at the chart for the last week to three months, i’d guess its about to run again, not down trend on a bell curve. With it having opened at .57 and dipping to .54 today before running, I set a limit buy for .57, because its at .61.

I’ve been out of the stock game for a while and this will be my first investment to get back into things. Do you think .57 is a good buy in price for tomorrow? Do you think ATOS will continue to uptrend until Friday?",2018-02-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7xeysj/can_i_get_some_opinions_on_atos_for_tomorrow/

I know penny stocks aren't the smartest way to go in some people's eyes, but I want to give it a try.

That being said, where does everyone view their stocks?  I know ETRADE and TDAmeritrade have live updates on their sites, but is there a way download a ticker onto my desktop?

If not, what are the best sites to watch these tickers?  Anything helps. ",2018-02-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7xeafp/where_do_you_find_penny_stock_tickers/

8,CRYO Earnings Out,7xjyhh,bighdaddie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7xjyhh/cryo_earnings_out/,6,2,"CRYO Earning came out for the 12-31 Quarter. Revenue from operations was $539k, their highest by far. Made money on a cash basis. March will not be as good due to the FDA, but the reason to own this is not current revenue and earnings, but the technology that they have and their ability to collect, ship and store stem cells for anyone in the industry. Stem cells are the future of medicine and this company will be one of the leading service providers for the biotechs providing treatment for any of the many applications. Not a short term trade, but I am looking for a buy out in the next 18-24 months above $5 per share.",2018-02-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7xjyhh/cryo_earnings_out/
