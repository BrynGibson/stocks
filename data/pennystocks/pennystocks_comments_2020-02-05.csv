ONTX drained off its morning gains but has a lot of catalysts. It’s probably a good price right now.

OGEN is up 10% at the moment. Not sure if this is a good entry price today or if it may come down some.

Good luck.

It should run into the conference  

I’m expecting it to level out higher somewhere and slowly rise into the results. Results are probably 4-6 weeks out.
