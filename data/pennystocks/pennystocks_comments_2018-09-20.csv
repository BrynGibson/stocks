Filings are supposed to hit tomorrow I think or Monday. The CEO said, “ProBility has been executing a disruptive strategy of defragmenting the vocational education and training market place and has experienced consistent sequential growth over the last seven quarters. The Company reported $8,913,956 of revenue for fiscal year 2017 versus $3,089,974 for fiscal year 2016,” stated Evan Levine, CEO of ProBility Media. “ProBility is committed to continue to grow our revenue streams while concurrently strengthening our bottom line and becoming a more efficient operation. These steps will enable us to use our sales and marketing expertise to accelerate revenue growth while decreasing costs. However, we do anticipate a reduction in short term revenue during the transition period. The Company will be announcing results for the second quarter 2018 in the coming weeks.” 

I'm keeping that in mind and glad Evan is transparent with it, I still think they will be very good nonetheless
