54,supernova2020,ejtibbi,/r/pennystocks/comments/b7dzaq/kulr_technology_group_otcqb_kutg_10k_is_out/ejtibbi/,1,"Right. They provide passive ""cooling"" materials based on a carbon fiber architecture, which to the best of my knowledge is the only company in the world that provides such technologies. I know Samsung used carbon fiber in their copper heat pipes for the Note 9 phone ([https://www.coolingzone.com/index.php?read=1581](https://www.coolingzone.com/index.php?read=1581)), but this must differ from KUTG's technology  otherwise there would have been patent infringement. Carbon fiber in the right configuration is more thermally conductive than traditional materials used like copper and aluminum. It's also a lighter material, which becomes advantageous for applications where weight and size are a concern (i.e. electric vehicles).  

The markets that the Company is currently focused on is high-end, high performance markets which include aerospace and E-Mobility. Although potential patent infringement is certainly a concern, due to the Company's longstanding history of serving the aerospace industry and patents, I believe the threat is very low that a global auto maker or aerospace industry would circumvent KULR Technology Group. 

It will be interesting to see how the Company progresses and whether or not their carbon fiber solutions represent the next-gen of thermal management materials for electronics and battery applications.  There are risks moving forward, such as improving battery chemistry (safer batteries) and competing material science technologies. However, for the foreseeable future, I believe this Company has a real opportunity to capture significant market share in the thermal management space.  Time will tell. ",2019-03-30
