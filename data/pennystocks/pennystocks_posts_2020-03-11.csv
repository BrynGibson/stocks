Been all over the canadian IPOs of MMED and SHRM. 

Strong user and believer of the products of MMED and shark tanks Kevin O'Leary is in very early on it. My money is on this one to do the best.

SHRM I bought to stay ontop of the industry. Still got DD to dig up.

I think with how pot stocks soared early, it's a chance to set and forget these stocks. Especially seeing as magic mushrooms and lsd are finally getting the unbiased attention from the medical sector that it deserves. Ibogaine is like a hard reset when it comes to addictions and lsd has so many benefits in small doses.

LITT is another one I threw a hundred dollars at, but not expecting too much.

Compass pathways is an IPO I am waiting on as well

CEO responded to revenue question. 

""Yes. When we start generating revenues, it will be roughly 15 liters of oil per day with our new machine that is now installed. At $7,000 liter, allows us to generate roughly $105,000 per day"". 

Now, its sister company, TGGI said that in April the first transaction will start from GCGX, for 10k per month. That means, due to the agreement, GCGX will start generating it revenues in April. 

Keep watch if nothing else. Its at $0.002 right now. Just couple months ago, its was $0.03 and that was with NO revenues. :)

Current output is apparently something like 6-7oz a day, but once they get the money to ramp up operations expect an output of at least 11oz a day. Additionally they are exploring more properties and getting ready to begin mining in those areas as well. target is 100oz a week in the near future, which given their current numbers seems within reach. 

In addition to gold they are developing silver and copper mines as well. 

I believe there is potential in this stock for several reasons. First it has reached a high of $0.235 on a previous find (currently training around $0.0035-0.005), that appeared to be smaller then the current operations they are developing.

Second, The destabilization of the stock market typically drives the price of gold up, so they are set to see their product become even more valuable in the near future. 

Lastly, it's a bit of a gut feeling on this one. The company is being run by an old gold hound with a long history of mining. Reading about this operation, his history, and researching his crew I think this might pull through to at least its previous high. Given the current price this would be a huge ROI, and in my mind worth the risk.

Their increased production goals are for the end of this month so they should be posting good news soon, and reporting increased income as well.
