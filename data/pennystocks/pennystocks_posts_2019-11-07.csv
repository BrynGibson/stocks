3,pennystock basics,dssdbf,drdjlowinhibitions,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dssdbf/pennystock_basics/,1,0,"this was a comment I made on someone else's post but id like to get others' opinions on this strategy. Id hate to be wrong and lead someone down the wrong path:

You don't have to know why something is reacting, you just have to know what everyone else thinks is happening. This is the main concept of why technical analysis works.

I have been trading stocks since I was 18, with the rise of zero commissions I am full force back in the game. here is the way I do it

I have a daily scanner that shows stocks with unusual (high) volume, a high market cap, and a specified price range (under $10)

from there I start looking for indicators: Research these and how they work.

my first look is a MACD that has a large gap followed by a positive crossover below 0

a stochastic indicator that is spiking above 30%

a high ATR

and an RSI showing overbought that is indicating that the MACD gap is, in fact, true

(this can be used for swing trading or day trading, always check the 4 main charts. YTD for support/resistance. the 30-minute chart for indicators (this is the main I use) the 15 minute to confirm daily trends and the 1 minute for the strongest(cheapest) entry point possible.)

Now, these are all technical indicators. there are many more aspects that understanding business, accounting, and economics will address but this is a good place to start. A great example of this is $SLM on October 24th of this year. it hit the highest and lowest point that it had reached that month within a single day. using these indicators I was able to buy at the absolute lowest price available and sell for $1.50 higher per share 2 days later.

with 100 shares I made $150 on that trade then went to work and made the same amount. if you study and work hard, trading truly can become a supplementary or full-time income.

if you understand these concepts you can also use this method for shorting stocks",2019-11-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dssdbf/pennystock_basics/
