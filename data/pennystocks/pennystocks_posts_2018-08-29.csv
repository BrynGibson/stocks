Investors are usually forward looking. 

Back when the Reliqs $RQHTF.OTC price hit $2.50CDN+, it was my opinion that Reliq it had hit its fair value, based on a discounted earnings methodology ($.06/1k x 49k patients / 1.2 factor for discounting = $2.55). 

Unfortunately, a hardware issue (and reorg) slowed things down and spooked the market, leading to the price decline. 

Those 2 events are behind the company now. 

Even though the patient onboarding rate is unknown at present, we can see Reliq continues to execute new contracts and sign new deals. There being 9 in total for 66,200 patients.  (Using the same methodology might put the fair value at $3.11 although personally I think you have to add some cash to that.)  

If investors see that onboarding has recommenced in earnest (and new contracts continue to be signed), then the forward looking valuations should start up again and we should see much higher prices.  (the CEO comment about Reliq maintaining their onboarding guidance is a big hint in this regard.) [Email response from IR posted in Facebook Imvestors Group - Search: Reliq Health Technologies Stock Forum

Regardless, the current price is IMHO a gift and I've been accumulating for the first time in a year.  Friends have been too. Not one of us has sold a single share. My intention is to wait for the liquidity event, which should still be a couple of years away, I would think.
