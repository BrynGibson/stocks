$750....LMAO...Look at the chart, what about the technicals indicates that kind of change? Nothing. I didn't look at the fundamentals, but can't imagine that they would offer much to indicate any kind of improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for 'shipping season', I feel that is just a pump tactic. I mean, the volume candles on TOPS are almost laughable. Since when does a company that ships over the oceans peak during the holidays? Even so, just because the business goes up, doesn't mean the stock will rise with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, does that mean money can't be made with it, absolutely not, but it is definitely a day trade type of stock, not a hold stock, imo.",2018-11-29

I would say your best bet would be to do research first, then worry about buying. It can be a bit cheaper. As for ways to trade OTC stocks, you would have to check what brokers offer OTC stocks/markets. ",2018-11-29

23,Burgers8,eapn3b1,/r/pennystocks/comments/a1ejep/help/eapn3b1/,1,It takes more time for them to go up for example it will stay between .30-.45 for a year or two go up so you won't be making profit for a long time. so you can get a lot of it and if you're lucky the macd will cross and go up but you will have to find a stock that is ready to make that move. Stocks that go up and down have more volume are easier to predict. Learn about simple moving and exponential moving average And CCI and RSI and it's going to look like a pice of cake.,2018-11-29
