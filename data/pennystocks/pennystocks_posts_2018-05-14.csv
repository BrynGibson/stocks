13,How to trade penny stocks? What beginner needs to know,8jemqm,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8jemqm/how_to_trade_penny_stocks_what_beginner_needs_to/,44,30,"How to trade penny stocks?

Let’s continue with the video project in which I use Google search data to filter out most common questions and terms people search related to penny stocks.

Next most asked question which beginner trader asks is “how to trade penny stocks?”.

Here is the next video:

https://youtu.be/WzkOP06o\_ZM

And here is as well written content to answer your question.

I squeezed video main points into three simple steps.

1. First and foremost you need to have a stockbroker. I do believe in today’s market all stockbrokers are available online. They will provide you with a trading platform through which you can make an orders to buy or sell stocks \(check video for best options\).
2. Learn about trading in general. Trading is trading, guys! Trading is more technical way to operate in the financial market of your choice. Traders use various charting analysis techniques \(examples: Japanese candlestick technique; value spread analysis, classical charting &amp; technical analysis and others\) or various indicators \(examples: RSI; moving averages; fibonacci retracements levels and more\) to predict future price trends. So learn about trading in general because it is applicable to all markets you will be interested in trading. Just small recommendation \- don’t be afraid to incorporate some parts of fundamental analysis into your overall analysis \- it gives bigger edge to your trading. Believe it!
3. Understand the market or niche you trade and its specifics. So if you are interested in trading micro and nano cap stocks aka penny stocks, here it is: to trade penny stocks successfully you need to know few fundamental things about this stock niche. Many penny stocks tend to trend down \(due to poor companies financial performance\), so this niche is perfect for short sellers to find great short selling opportunities. To quickly introduce you to short selling \- short seller is a trader who profits when stock’s price is trading lower. Most online stockbrokers allow you to short sell stock with the click of the button. Next, penny stocks and all these low floating stocks are famous for huge home runs. These small stocks can double within the day. It is very common for microcap stock to finish week with 100&amp;#37; gains. But these quick price spikes tend to stretch further to oblivion for sometime and then crash down another days taking all profits away. You need to be quick with these runners because many traders are rushing to close their position with profit simply by selling their shares to the market \(other participatns\) and going out with cash. To finish here, if you are interested to day trade penny stocks be aware that liquidity can be an issue, meaning it can be hard to close position, so do not start betting big on these stocks and if you are rookie only look to day trade penny stocks that have decent daily trading volume. This is way trade penny stocks on reguler stock exchanges is a safe choice.
