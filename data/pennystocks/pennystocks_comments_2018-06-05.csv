90,Banshay,e0ff12j,/r/pennystocks/comments/8ou5fy/akers_bid_price_requirement_question/e0ff12j/,1,"I lost a chunk of change on AKERS because I dumped when it announced it pulled its FDA application for chlamydia testing. I don‚Äôt regret dumping so much as not waiting a couple days for the price to level some.

AKERS often drops after earnings. Also the founder may be alleging accounting shenanigans IIRC. Add the R/S and no chlamydia FDA and it‚Äôs hard to see what the company has going for it beyond its current line of tests, unless ER is really positive. Just selling its current line has the company losing money from what I recall. 

I haven‚Äôt followed since FDA withdrawal though so things may be different. ",2018-06-05
