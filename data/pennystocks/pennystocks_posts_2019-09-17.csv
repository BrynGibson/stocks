https://www.snakesandlattes.com/

The company is currently building its 5th board game cafe location in Tucson, and just announced the acquisition of its 6th location in Guelph, previously The Boardroom. Boardroom's founder states in the press release "" Snakes and Lattes is the ‘gold standard’ for board game cafés worldwide"":

The company is rolling out an ambitious retail venue expansion plan via Joint Ventures with funding partners, 17 of which are currently in early stages across the US:

Snakes and Lattes acquired board game developer Morning and is currently in the process of releasing their own self-published game ""Kill the Unicorns"" for the upcoming holiday season:

https://twitter.com/AmfilTech/status/1151308235078430720

At its 25$ price point this early print run represents 1M$ in revenue, and the company already has an agreement in place for the game with Walmart, so the Christmas print runs could be significantly larger:

The share price is currently depressed because of a very lengthy audit/uplist process from OTCPink to OTCQB. However, the initial audit risk is mitigated by the fact that FY2016 and FY2017 have been fully audited and signed off on, and 2018 and 2019 are expected shortly, which will enable uplist to QB. With verified 2017 revenues 8,168,251$, in my view this is a good buying opportunity with prices depressed by the lengthy ongoing audit process:

Kickstarter board game releases and the game industry in general are booming, and board game cafes are popping up in college towns and big cities all over the world; Snakes and Lattes is by far the most well-established board game cafe brand in the world, and seems poised to be a major player in this emerging cafe and game publishing+fulfillment industry.
