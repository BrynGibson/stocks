454,canieatthis1,flyp378,/r/pennystocks/comments/frv53a/swing_plays/flyp378/,1,"Well I don’t know much but imo the past week looks like it’s been mostly from accumulation. Doesn’t seem like anyone is selling into the bid because it sat at .0013. For most of the day, so people are definitely waiting for something. 

The company has had the same O/S since 12/18 so they’re not diluting it into the ground(yet) and don’t appear to be in the near future to me. They’re also becoming PINK CURRENT soon and from the tweet it included “developments they’ve been working on to be rolled out” 

So with share price closing over SMA20,50,200 and news to come I believe it will have a nice climb north! Also, when this happened in 05/19 it got all the way to .0035. Anything is possible, so if they release some good news and volume maintains or builds, I believe it do well. But like I said, anything is possible and they could just raise the A/S and take on more toxic notes. Lol this is all just imo though... I think it appears as a good buy considering what I see now.",2020-03-30

The trial is May 11th 2020. Many Billions could be at stake and there’s 6 paid bashers working overtime on the SECI message  board trying to convince people it’s a worthless lawsuit and not to buy shares. There is a very high level of manipulation going on with this one and a short squeeze also. So it has ridiculous potential.  Shareholders believe that’s if SECI wins just 1 Billion dollar judgement or settlement that 1 share of SECI will be worth approximately $3,275 because only 306,000 shares exist due to 3 reverse stock splits they were forced to do to fend off price manipulation from shorting the stock.",2020-03-30
