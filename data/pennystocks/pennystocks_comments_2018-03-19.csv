Penny stocks are a lot like gambling to begin with. Many companies are flat out scams and the others have poor management which causes them to go bankrupt. You can still make money off of these companies, but more likely than not you will lose. It takes a lot of time and research to get the in and out of penny stocks because of the way the companies operate.

Have you thought about getting into self publishing? Many people make a good living self publishing e-books on Amazon and other websites. Then you could invest the excess into penny stocks and it not be a huge loss of the investment didn't pan out. When you have built up a large enough bank roll you could then go into day trading without worry.

*ATB-346 is the main value driver for Antibe as the NSAID market is valued at $8 billion total. We model for approval in OA, however we believe that if the drug is approved it will likely go on to be approved for multiple indications similar to celecoxib. There are approximately 27 million individuals in the U.S. with OA (NIAMS). Of those, we estimate approximately 50% are taking or are open to taking oral NSAIDs. With a conservatively estimated 6% of the market, ATB-346 would have peak sales of $1.0 billion. In the E.U., where there are approximately 40 million patients with OA (WHO), a similar market share could generate close to $1 billion in revenue. Using a 12% royalty rate, an 18% discount rate, and a 50% chance of approval, we estimate the net present value of ATB-346 to be $171 million. When taking into account estimated capital requirements, the current conversion to Canadian Dollars (USD$1 = CAD$1.27), and dividing by the fully diluted share count of 256.7 million shares leads to a valuation of approximately CAD$0.85. We believe investors would be wise to take a close look at Antibe ahead of the Phase 2b results in March 2018. *",2018-03-19

When surveillance staff believe that the information is material enough to significantly impact the price of the security they might issue a “trading halt.” A trading halt is a temporary pause in trading to allow the market to properly absorb the information. It is based on the principle that all investors should have the same timely access to important company information.

The reactivation of trading after a halt is called a “trade resumption.” ",2018-03-19
