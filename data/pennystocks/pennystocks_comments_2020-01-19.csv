2,Daveywallnut,fey7oxy,/r/pennystocks/comments/equbgm/recommend_a_platform/fey7oxy/,1,I'm in the uk and I use interactive brokers. Not the cheapest commission platform that is available but the balance between cost and reliability pays off. Covers all types of trading and if you make sure you request access then you will have no issues trading penny stocks on the platform. Mobile app with alerts too is usefull with the volatile nature of the game,2020-01-19

i've looked into Think or Swim (thats TDAmeritrade right?)

I have been trading outside of penny stocks already ($10+) but would like the option to look at potential pennies and OTCs.

41,Daveywallnut,ff4e87w,/r/pennystocks/comments/equbgm/recommend_a_platform/ff4e87w/,1,"I used it on my laptop a couple of times over wifi connection and there did seem to be an occasional stutter and delay of tickers which I found concerning. Even when I had full signal it would notify me that trading connection had been lost then immediately re-established which I think if I was in the middle of an execution at the time could have caused some issues. 

This was only temp for me and since I switched to using my desktop with a wired connection, it has been no bother and I've not had any of these problems since.

The only real issue some people may have is that nothing is easy to use or in an obvious place. It takes some getting used to but if you take some time to learn the software and put in a few hot keys it's just as easy as any of the more user friendly looking platforms.

I've used them a few years now and honestly I wouldn't be opposed to switching, but for me I'm comfortable with it and I don't see anything better there at the moment. Hope this has helped with your own decision making",2020-01-19
