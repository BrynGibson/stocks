39,NecessaryPosition,eocivhw,/r/pennystocks/comments/br9yxl/fusion_fsnn_wins_major_enterprise_agreement/eocivhw/,1,"I'll preface this by saying that I hold ~1,100 shares of FSNN @ $0.13 a share, so you know where I'm coming from, and have a vested interest in their success and ideally wanting others to buy the stock, but also that I'm currently getting fucked on, so buyer be ware if you want to take the gamble and a half that is FSNN.

**

I'll start with this: Yahoo Finance has a 1y Target Estimate of $4.88 and a recommended buy rating from 2 analysts. Barchart's technical opinion is a sell and their only Analyst rating is currently a hold. Looking at the candles, over 5 days it looks like it's climbing, but if you look at the 1 month it's looks to just bounce up and down. Is this the bottom. No, I think the bottom is bankruptcy, and I think it's a real possibility. See my next section.

**

They are probably about to face a class action lawsuit because of how the process used by one of it's subsidiaries to capitalize costs which made their earnings look higher than they were for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, resulting in losses in stock value when it was discovered. My guess is they could survive this, but the problem is they are already struggling on a near daily basis. Look up their SEC 8-K filings. They are almost constantly staving off their lenders by working with an even bigger lender (At least my understanding of it.) which is requiring them to reorg. Now that could be great and might get them headed in the right direction.

**

Now look up their open job positions. They aren't growing, they can't hold down employees. This is apparently when you look at their GlassDoor reviews. Again, maybe a reorg will help them figure that out, but chances are it is going to be a belt tightening exercise at the expense of the technical talent they are going to need to get an IT business on track.

**

Personally, I'm going to keep holding and hope they can correct course and stop sinking. As someone who has worked for several managed service providers and has watched customers walk away from contracts they just signed because the MSP's team ended up being trash and failing to meet SLA/KPI/contractual obligations; I don't think one enterprise agreement that fronts a few million is enough to cause the stock value to rise enough to turn more than a couple bucks profit unless you're playing with four or five figure investments... which I wouldn't put anywhere near these fuckwits.",2019-05-21

The lawsuit you are correct in, but trust me, there are calls for lawsuits daily, hourly maybe. They were looking for people who lost 100k (I believe), from it, or had 100k shares, not sure on of the 2. They could not find a single person. They lowered it by 50%, and still not a single person singed up for these lawsuits, they are all hunting for gains for themselves. 

The current CEO is the son of the founder, he doesnt want it to go BK at all, and they will not. 

Some investors had to sell because of the nasdaq delisting, and trust me they had the money to pay for it, but they are valued too low for nasdaq at that point, so there was no point for them in paying 25k usd to get delisted shortly after anyway. 

They hired a few days ago, added someone to the board, who also filed a document today what could lead to future buys of shares or rewards in shares.
