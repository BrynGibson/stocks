4,CV Sciences CVSI- Equity Research Report,7ouzx7,wbcinvesting,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7ouzx7/cv_sciences_cvsi_equity_research_report/,4,0,"**Investment Overview:**
	From this report, you will find that CV Sciences Inc. has a high possibility of an increase in stock price because of the strong financial statements and huge growth opportunities within a growing industry.


**Company Profile:**
At CV Sciences, our mission to improve well‐being underscores our values, operations, and products. CV Sciences operates two distinct divisions: pharmaceuticals and consumer products. These divisions are supported by our medical and scientific advisory board, and state‐of‐the art production facilities. CV Sciences’ Pharmaceutical Division is developing synthetically‐formulated cannabidiol‐based medicine, pursuing the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drugs with specific indications utilizing cannabidiol as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. CV Sciences has achieved promising preclinical results in the development of cannabinoid medicines for treatment of a range of medical conditions. CV Sciences’ Consumer Products Division delivers botanical‐based cannabidiol products that enhance quality of life. Currently distributed nationally in health food stores, health care provider’s offices and online, each consumer products brand is backed by a formal safety review, growing body of case reports, and physician’s recommendations.


**Financial Profile:**
	CV Sciences trades at $0.435 a share as of close on Friday, January 5th, 2018 with a $39,372,966 market cap. Currently, CV Sciences has 90,512,565 shares outstanding out of a total of 190,000,000 shares authorized. The Company trades under the OTCQB as the ticker symbol CVSI and has a daily average volume of 1,138,162 from the past 30 days. The float is rather low at 20,890,348 shares, but there is currently 21,400,000 shares that are restricted from a recent acquisition and, “Royalty Buy-Out.” After these shares are not restricted, CVSI’s volume and liquidity will increase. 
	These basic financials are the first characteristics I look at when I research any stock. People often forget about the importance of shares outstanding with micro and nano cap stocks. I always look for a company that has under 200 million shares outstanding, so the shares that I invest in can go farther. For example, while comparing two stocks both priced at $0.50 and one has 100 million outstanding shares and the other has 1 billion. It’s easier for a company to move to a $100 million market cap, than a $1 billion market cap. In this case, CVSI passes my initial review for outstanding shares and market cap. Also, the company has a high enough average trade volume for the liquidity of most investors. The last 52 weeks, CVSI had a $0.68 high and a $0.14 low, so the stock is currently trading below the 1 year highs.


**Financial Report:**
	According to the last 10-Q Report, issued on November 8th, 2017 for the quarter ending on September 30th, 2017, the Company currently has $20,410,496 of assets. Of those assets, $8,135,774 are Current Assets and $1,572,125 of Cash. The Total Liabilities only add up to be $5,133,069 and of that is $3,576,769 of Currently Liabilities. Breaking down the Current Liabilities, the two largest portions are the $1,053,794 Accounts Payable and an Iliad Note that totals $1,939,353 of secured and unsecured debt
	Comparing this 10-Q report to the 10-Q a year ago, the Total Assets and Current Assets have decreased by 20.8% and 48.6%. Also, the Current Liabilities has increased by 18.8%. This would mean the Current Ratio from September 30th, 2016 to September 30th, 2017 has decreased from 5.26 to 2.27. Over the past year, CVSI has taken control of their balance sheet by increasing debt to increase revenue over the year, which we will go over next.
	The nine-month revenue for September 30th, 2017 is $13,437,233 and a Gross Profit of $9,275,111, which is a 71.17% and 79.09% increase from the year past. The Company’s largest expense for the nine-month 2017 year is Research and Development, which is $11,513,560. Also, there was a one-time expense of $2,432,000 for a, “Royalty Buy-Out.” Overall, CV Sciences has a nine-month Net Loss of $5,366,946. This is an increase from the $5,660,755 Net Loss from the past year. These numbers are very promising because without the, “Royalty Buy-Out,” and being able to keep 100% of the revenues moving forward, the Company’s Net Loss will start to diminish and become positive.
	Going on to the Cash Flow statement, the nine-month Cash and Restricted Cash has increased by $1,264,842 to $2,322,310. The one number that stands out in the cash flow statement is the $750,000 increase in cash from borrowing. In the 2016 nine-month cash flow statement, the Company had borrowed $1,975,000. This shows that CV Sciences is able to run the company on less debt.
	Overall, CV Sciences has growth in revenue, uses debt better, and is financially strong to assure that the company can work another year on current financials. 


**Technical Analysis:**
	I’m not huge on the technical analysis of a company, but there are a few things I always look at. First, CVSI has an RSI of 53.28, so it has room to grow before it is overbought. Also, the Company has a 50-day moving average of $0.31, which is above the $0.29 200-day moving average. These two numbers show that CVSI has room to increase before it is overbought and the momentum to increase even more.


**Public Relations:**
November 14th, 2017- The Company was named on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500TM, which is an annual ranking of the fastest growing companies in the technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences, and energy tech sectors in North America. CV Sciences has seen revenues grow 403% from 2013 to 2016.

	
**Company Growth:**
	CV Sciences currently sells products through their PlusCBD Oil and Purified Liquid brands. The Company is also developing a CBD-based potentially FDA approved drug (CVSI-007) that is a chewing gum that contains nicotine and synthetic CBD to support the cessation of smokeless tobacco uses and addiction. The new drug is currently in preclinical stages. CVSI has 15 different conferences/trade shows scheduled for the 2018 year to promote and sell the CBD oil products. CV Sciences is currently selling their products in over 1,500 stores nationally. With more states starting to legalize medical and recreation marijuana and the multiple conferences and trade shows, I believe we will see continuing growth of sales for the Company.


**Company Concern:**
	On June 15th, 2017, the SEC alleges that the CEO of CV Sciences, Michael Mona Jr., made material representations/misleading omission of the CannaVEST (past name for CV Sciences) quarterly report filed for the first three quarters of 2013. This relates to their acquisition of PhytoSphere Systems, LLC in January of 2013. The Company came out with a report stating that they stand behind their CEO and the company reporting of this acquisition. Because this situation happened almost 5 years ago and CV Sciences is standing their ground against the SEC, it is not detrimental to the Company. 


**Investment Conclusion:**
	Because of CV Sciences Inc. high current ratio, growth of revenue and gross profit, low outstanding shares, low RSI, momentum, and being within a growing industry, I believe there is a huge opportunity of a price increase in the future
