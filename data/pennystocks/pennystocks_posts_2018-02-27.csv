CHICAGO, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epazz, Inc. (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company will launch a social media and workflow blockchain app using its Proprietary Blockchain Storage technology, which was initially created for the Cordtell project. One of Cordtell’s core features is blockchain storage technology that retrieves data from the blockchain, allowing users to view the data on their mobile devices. This technology was included in the Blockchain Smart Contract provisional patent.

The company believes this is a major opportunity to expand the block storage technology into other blockchain mobile apps, and also believes it will be able to file additional patents for related operations. This core feature is in the final development stage. The company will be releasing this application before the end of the second quarter of 2018.

The company will announce the name of the social media and workflow blockchain app and its website in the future. The business model for the app will be free—for limited uses—for consumers, with ads and in-application purchase options for additional features. For businesses, the app will offer a workflow service, which will have an approval layer to send, receive, and broadcast data within an organization. Businesses will be able to use the workflow service for a monthly fee.

“We are taking features of Cordtell that are in the final stages of development and releasing them into separate applications to monetize the technology. We believe there are several more applications that could be created based on our proprietary technology,” said Shaun Passley, PhD, chairman, and CEO of Epazz, Inc.

About Cordtell (www.cordtell.com)

Cordtell reduces fraud in business transactional contracts. The technology allows for a transactional contract to become a living contract that is tracked and traced; it also verifies that a section of terms within a contract are followed and that all parties of an agreement obey the terms of the contract.

Cordtell, which is under development, automatically verifies signatures, distributes the contract to the blockchain, records the transaction and verifies the terms are being followed via our blockchain apps, which also trace any changes. The technology sends reminders, and tracks payments and delivery of items. The technology will work with Microsoft Word and Google Docs to provide real-time contract edits and updates via version control. The company will primarily market the technology to law firms, health care providers, businesses and governments.

WALMART(R) Increases Initial Orders By 44% For Saavy Naturals Everyday Bath Bombs Which Are To Be Distributed To 3,600 Walmart Nationwide Locations   

CHATSWORTH, CA - (NewMediaWire) - February 27, 2018 - Trimax Corporation, Inc. (OTC PINK: TMXN) (the ""Company"") and its wholly owned subsidiary Saavy Naturals Inc., is pleased to announce they have recently received additional purchase orders from Walmart (R) Corporation for the Company's new Saavy Naturals Everyday body care line.

As previously reported, the initial Walmart (R) purchase order called for the purchase of 60,000 Saavy Naturals Everyday Bath Bombs which has now been increased by an additional 26,000 representing a 44% increase to the order which is planned to be distributed to 3,600 Walmart (R) nationwide locations.

Additionally, at the request of Walmart (R) buyers, Saavy Naturals and their exclusive representative U.S. Merchants have created unique one-of-a-kind pallet displays for Saavy Naturals Everyday Handcrafted Bulk Soaps, which are expected to go into approximately 700 additional stores sometime over the next several weeks. Based on ongoing discussions, the Company still anticipates seeing consistent purchase orders from Walmart (R) on a weekly basis beginning March 2018.

The most recent purchase orders received from Walmart (R) is a cumulation of hard work and dedication from all parties involved in addressing the needs of big box retail consumers looking for 100% all-natural healthy alternatives for skin and body care needs.

Hugo Saavedra, CEO of Trimax Corporation and Saavy Naturals Inc., stated, ""Years of hard work has finally brought us to the point where we can finally market ourselves to a broader mass of retail consumers looking for a luxurious quality product that is 100% all natural with excellent price points. We consider this relationship with Walmart (R) substantial to our goal of making Saavy Naturals a household name in the body care industry."" He also stated, ""We will continue to keep shareholders abreast of our developments as they continue.""

Hugo and Debra Saavedra, Saavy Naturals Inc.'s, CEO and President, gained instant popularity for their all-natural body care product line after being spotlighted and appearing on ABC's hit show Shark Tank. The Sharks took an instant liking to Hugo and Debra, their love story, their previous success in the body care industry, and the superior quality of their all-natural product. Hugo and Debra have since increased the company's product line exposure with several highlighted television features on The Home Shopping Network and are currently working on additional television marketing opportunities.
