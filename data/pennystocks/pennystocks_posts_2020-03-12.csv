So most of you know how $AYTU secured an exclusive distribution deal for a rapid test kit for Coronavirus with Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co. 
Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/PR-CO-20200310-906710) 


So what's the big deal? Well, here is the big deal. The test will provide result in 2-10 minutes. It's specially helpful at the hospital since USA doesn't have this rapid kit yet. It will also be useful at the airport as well to test travellers coming to the USA from foreign country. 

So far so good. But who is backing it? 
Well, remember Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech? Guess who their primary funder is? Well it's Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

Okay, pretty good. But how will they distribute these rapid test kits in the USA in such a short time? 
Well, there is a rumor going on that Amazon and Gates foundation is teaming up to deliver Coronavirus test kits.

 With Backing from Gates foundation and logistics from Amazon, this kit will be  available all over the USA in a very short time. And the only company who has the authorization to distribute it in the USA is $AYTU .

The product: The product is a patented, human-safe system that provides cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting and decontaminating fluid solutions to tackle microbial infection and infestations. Their products and solutions are designed to take an environmentally mindful approach at combatting the spread of infectious diseases and contamination in the Healthcare and Cleaning industry as well as contributing to the sustainability of global natural resources in the energy and agricultural markets. 

The markets they serve and/or looking to serve so far include: Hospitals and Healthcare, Agriculture, Oil and Gas, Hotel and Tourism, Food/Service Production, recently looking to break into the Cannabis industry.

Their current clients are 8 hospitals (11 units) with 3 more hospitals coming within the next few weeks, along with more in the pipeline. 

PCT UK, the joint venture partner in Britain commenced a 60-day test Jan 15th – the end of March to verify the results that they have had in the states. Unless bacteria and viruses are any different in the UK (they are not), there will be no difficulty in verifying the claims. 

Some things that Gary Grieco, CEO of PCT has stated recently:

“Has grown 400% the last year and on target to grow exponentially this current year. Company is growing far more efficient and loses are down significantly.” 

“Currently trading on OTC, ""PCTL"" aspires to and is actively engaged in preparations for up-listing its common stock to a national securities exchange. The Company established entry into its target markets with commercially viable products in the United States and now continues to gain market share in the U.S. and U.K.“ 

""As a result of the capabilities and benefits of our products, many companies and municipalities across a variety of industries and geographic locations are engaging in intense discussions with PCT LTD."" 

**""The 800 pound gorilla, Corona-virus, that has opened up a huge opportunity for us and I cannot say any more than we have been contacted by, and are actively negotiating to address the problem with both companies and government officials and I cannot say more than that.""** 

Seems like it may be a good longterm investment, but I'm just a noob and don't know what I'm doing so I recommend doing your own DD and deciding for yourself :)

50,$AYTU and Sabby,fhjv4k,dp79,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fhjv4k/aytu_and_sabby/,1,45,"I thought I’d share here something I looked into. 

Today, $AYTU filed a 13G today in which it disclosed that Sabby Mgmt owns 6M shares. They were likely part of one of the offerings. 

http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1385818/000153561020000080/0001535610-20-000080.txt

This is significant because Sabby also was part of $CODX’s offering on January 27th. This was right before CODX announced that they had completed development of their test kits and that they were successful in detecting CV. CODX announced this on January 31st. 

[CODX 13G for Sabby](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535610/000153561020000062/codx0120.txt)

[CODX announced completion &amp; success of tests - Jan 31](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200131005557/en/Co-Diagnostics-Announces-Successful-Initial-Verification-Coronavirus-Test)

The point here is that Sabby obviously has some inside information that shows they know the Aytu tests are legit, effective, and will pass FDA EUA. 

The other point is that Sabby has a much higher stake in Aytu than CODX. No hedge fund would purchase a HIGHER stake in a competitive position unless they firmly believe that their product is better. 

At this point, I think the FDA EUA approval is a foregone conclusion and that Aytu’s tests are the real thing. 

Just some food for thought.",2020-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fhjv4k/aytu_and_sabby/

Basically every stock I invested in is down big and has been dropping every day. IBIO, NVAX, GHSI, CHFS, HTBX...all for a total of an $800 (-31%) loss in just a couple weeks. Most of it in IBIO. 

If I weren’t invested in Corona virus/health stocks, I wouldn’t be worried because obviously the entire market is crashing. But with how serious the virus is getting and the pressure to come up with solutions, theoretically these stocks should be increasing in value and yet everyday they’re seeing major losses. 

I don’t need the money at the moment but I guess I just don’t see how these stocks keep from falling even more. At this rate IBIO might even go back to $1.

Only company that has any experience with the corona viruses and worked on developing products and medicine for mers which is the respiratory infection caused by the viruses.

Granted 5,000,000 from Linda &amp; gates foundation for research 

First round of vaccine testing was successful and ""Provided the hoped immune system response."", Although, they have not yet attempted human testing.

They are projected to put the vaccine into place in April and put out 1,000,000 dosages by the end of 2020. They also mentioned they would need help with distribution of the dosages, as they couldn't distribute enough themselves for the pubic health.

Coming out with multiple new products for respiratory problems etc. these have been shown to at least be somewhat effective.
