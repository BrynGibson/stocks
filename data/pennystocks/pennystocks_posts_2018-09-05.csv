0,Thoughts on SAEX,9dcbas,galactictaco42,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9dcbas/thoughts_on_saex/,8,11,"I am new to the penny game, I'm trying to turn my $100 into $200 as a test run.

I noticed SAEX was down around .60 cents and that historically they were at least above $1 (obviously that isn't all i need to pay attention to, i know) and they have quite a bit of negative sounding news out there, but do we have any faith in that stock rebounding even to $1 or $1.50? MTN is another one that looked like it might rebound off of its low price.

am i just a noob seeing patterns shadows or does anyone else think these guys could be a profit driver for a short term?",2018-09-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9dcbas/thoughts_on_saex/
1,XNNHQ- Xenonics Holdings- bankrupt and out of business for over 2 years...has gone up nearly 1000% in a month. How?,9d1gnc,Mite-o-Dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9d1gnc/xnnhq_xenonics_holdings_bankrupt_and_out_of/,16,7,"I bought XNNHQ back in 2014, sold half at the end of 2014, made a decent profit, kept the rest, but the company went bankrupt in March of 2016 and lost the rest of the money I had making the value of it in my portfolio literally just pennies. Not even worth selling. 

I've been noticing that it's been going up a lot lately to include a 100% gain today. 

My question is how? I can't find any proof that this company even exists anymore. No news, products, of reports since early 2016. How are companies like this even able to be traded? And why would anyone even buy into a company like this? Sure, I guess all the recent ones actually made good money, but it's just crazy to me that people can make money off something that doesn't exist. Is this normal?",2018-09-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9d1gnc/xnnhq_xenonics_holdings_bankrupt_and_out_of/
