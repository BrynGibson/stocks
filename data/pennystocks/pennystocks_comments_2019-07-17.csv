A lot of new players to day trading buy and sell cheap stocks because you have a better chance to make money off a quick trade by buying a lot of stock vs buying 1 expensive stock. It's always a good way to learn how to trade without spending a lot of money which is more risky.

TTCM is a close second but more risky since there are bigger companies that can mimic the tech. And the tech hadn’t been proven on the public yet. Still s good play though. I’m holding a pile of those shares after having sold for my investment plus profit. So my 500k leftovers are free.
