Here’s a little of what I know.

-Sourcing li from brines in South America in unreliable and grades can be poor, evap ponds can and do get flooded, affecting projected outputs

-Their is a shift to Australian hard rock spodumene, but prices are fluctuating as big investment house are still trying to guess the demand game.

-Currently their are plans for 50+ battery gigafactories world wide. 

-Albermarle lithium (biggest Li miner in the world), own a big steak of Mineral resources in Australia in Wodinga, as they have been mining their own claim for many years and are running out.

- its very difficult for new mines to get financing and come Online and reach nameplate outputs, 

-hydroxide processing plants are in the works, as a shift from carbonate.

-nearly every car manufacturer will have a EV or BV in the next few years.

- mining in Africa is very volatile and most projects won’t see the light of day.

I’m not going to try plug my investment, but i’m all in on ASX:PLS (Pilbara Minerals), they are definitely the most promising and will no doubt be a top 3 producer and quite possibly the biggest in the world in a few years.

I’ll illustrate with two examples both being tech companies. Energous (NASDAQ: WATT) is basically developmental “early” stage like KUTG while the other, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is already a big player in the electric vehicle space with all three companies operating at a loss in the present day:

FYI in case you don’t know, WATT is working on “disruptive” wireless charging technology while KUTG is working on “disruptive” electronics and battery cooling technology.  

KULR Technology Group (OTC: KUTG, Market Cap $177 million as of today) total revenue for 2018 was ~$1.3 million, gross profit $937K, and net income -$2 million.  This is compared to only $236K revenue and -$2.4 million net income in 2017.  

Energous (NASDAQ: WATT, Market Cap $179 million as of today) total revenue for 2018 was ~$515K, gross profit $515K, and net income was -$50.9 million. This is compared to $1.15 million revenue and -$49.4 million net income in 2017. 

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA, Market Cap $47 billion as of today) total revenue for 2018 was $21.46 billion, gross profit $4 billion, and net income was -$976 million. This is compared to $11.76 billion and -$1.96 billion net income in 2017. 

Each company above is a disruptive growth story and on occasion had to raise capital when necessary to continue operations, fund R&amp;D, and growth (revenue). 

It could be argued that each of the three companies is overvalued based purely on current revenue and net income metrics, but that isn’t the whole story is it? So what’s your opinion on WATT and TSLA?",2019-04-09
