I have been day/swing trading for about 3 weeks now, so pretty new to trading myself. I mostly trade OTC penny stocks.

When I first started I used TD Ameritrade to be able to use Think or Swim and I really like using it for analysis of charts and level 2 but the commissions were killing me, especially because I had no idea what I was doing. I would make little trades thinking I was making an $8 profit, but in reality it was down $6 because of commissions (and myself not knowing wtf I was doing).

I later found out that Charles Schwab has $0 commission/fee on the stocks that I trade so switched over to them and been using their platform to trade but I still use TOS for stock analysis, cause their charts are better.",2020-04-11

140,OriginalGarnier,fn492to,/r/pennystocks/comments/fz9olt/icd_why/fn492to/,1,"If I can give my advice:
Try to understand the price action (how the stock moves) and focus on that. What are key support/resistance levels, where is most of the volume coming in, where is the least volume, what has the stock done in the past..

Most of the time in pennystock-land tickers move because of news&gt;price action&gt;eyes on the ticker (volume).

While news is one of the most important factors I personally use to back my thesis on a long or not, plenty of times a stock will run without any news at all. Often times 3-4 days after a good run/squeeze news will come out, most of the time an offering.

I know it sounds counterintuitive because im saying how important news is, but its more effecient for your learning curve to spend your studying hours learning what I mentioned above at the beginning. News is either good or bad, but even good news can drive a stock down. Especially with current market conditions things will run off of multiple factors that are near impossible to calculate. 

Another point is that news on a stock is a independant variable; we dont know or cant control when it comes out, all we can do is react.

Tl;DR - News is probably the strongest catalyst in a stocks volatility, but study the price action when just starting out as that is a part of trading you can control.",2020-04-11

The big things you need for the penny world: 

1. You need to have cash to lose. You *will* lose money - especially at first. The trick is knowing when to get out - both when you've made a little bit of money and when you've lost a little bit of money. Most of the time, you won't get back your losses and any gains are short lived. 
2. You need to be able to watch the market throughout the day. You're at an advantage here since you're close to college. You have more free time than most of us and can afford to have one eye on the market when not in school. Get out with small losses and small gains - it's all about day trading, not winning the lottery.
3. You need to start researching companies and find a sector you can learn a lot about. Bio-Pharmaceutical, Technology, Oil, Water, Medical in general...there are tons of sectors where you can make money. The only way to find a good penny stock is to actually read what they've posted, understand their financials, etc. It takes time to learn these things and more time to find a good company to put some money into (for a day trade or two). Even then, you'll be wrong more times than you're right. 

If you're honestly starting out and earning an income, start by putting money into a Roth IRA, max that out and invest it into something safe like VTSAX. Do that every year starting when you turn 18 and have earned $6000+ in a year. After that, set aside a small amount of money (maybe $1000-$2000) and invest a tiny bit of it into penny stocks. Maybe 100-200 shares here or there. Start very, very small and track your % gain per trade. If you do this for a bit and find that, on average, your gains are higher than your losses, then start putting more money in. 

And, as a final piece of advice, never ask for a specific stock to invest into. People will give you the worst possible advice. No one knows what the future holds and a lot of conversations around penny stocks are all hype. Find a good smallish group that you can learn from and go from there. This board has some good advice but people have gotten weird recently. StockTwits has a few diamonds, but is mostly hype when it comes to pennies.

You’ll probably pick it up for cheaper than open. I usually get out at 15-20% but that’s all determined by how many shares you’re buying and how volatile the action is. I always use limit orders. My goal is to make $275-375 a day 3-4 days a week max. Mind you I have day trading power. At 2pm the penny stocks often get a pop in the afternoon IF your volume is still strong. I rarely hold a penny stock overnight. I have to do a ton of homework for this to happen.,2020-04-11

Ex: stock abc trading at $0.51 with the potential to rise to $0.60. 

Stock abc now drops to $0.49 and I miss the entry, but I know that it’ll bounce back to $0.51 and work its way up to $0.60.

So I plan how many shares I should buy ahead of time at the $0.51 mark with a limit order.

Shareholders believe Microsoft is one of the companies that paid RedRover for a large scale data analytics tool in 2007.  RedRover is one of the companies Sector 10 is suing for the illegal sharing of Sector 10’s patented disruptor technology. Do a Google search for “when did Microsoft create Microsoft Azure”?  It will tell you it was created in 2009 and the codeword for the project was “Red Dog”.  Red Rover and Red Dog are pretty similar aren’t they ?     That’s why there are 6 high level paid bashers working the InvestorsHub SECI message board. They are in panic mode trying to manipulate and scare people away from this stock. This has the potential to become a true unicorn stock if they win the lawsuits.  Which they have over 50,000 pages of evidence to prove they own the technology and showing the illegal theft and laundering of the technology to 200 companies and individuals.

I don’t like to give advice because each individual thinks differently. I can simply explain how I’ve achieved my goals. 

I do a lot of key/word searches on  reddit, Twitter, and the internet in generally to find what others are saying about a company. 

hours of searching and reading and connecting the dots. Aka look at management on LinkedIn, their connections,past, etc. 

Every detail you find on a company is connected in come way, connect as many dots as you can before you decide.
