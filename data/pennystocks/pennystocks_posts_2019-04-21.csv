Can someone please tell me what this, in conjunction with the post by u/dutchpinkk earlier on r/robinhoodpennystocks titled 'PRPO Insider Filing', says about the stock? 


I get they are lowering the price on the filing from the agreement made last year, which makes sense bc it is lower than when the original agreement was made BUT does it mean anything positive or negative for the upcoming NASDAQ meeting, etc.? 


Also, if they are considering reverse splitting the stock, why go through this before you do it? Why not just not exercise the agreement and make a new one afterwards?",2019-04-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bfjdr5/more_prpo_info_help_predicting_the_future_needed/

&amp;#x200B;

New to penny stock investing and was wondering a few things.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I even go about finding new potential stocks to invest in? Do I randomly screen by price and volume and just starting researching the results? Are there any good websites that post daily stock picks to take a look at and do my own DD on? I browse this subreddit frequently and it has tons of great info, but I'm still a bit lost. I have been reading a lot of the posts on the ""how to"" of investing in penny stocks, but its the actual finding of the stock I can't wrap my head around.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like a lot of the stocks on here are typically not listed on the TSX...I am mainly looking for resources to help me find stocks listed on the TSX and I don't really know where to start. I was hoping a few of you knew some good websites/twitters I could be checking out daily.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",2019-04-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bflpno/rookie_tsx_penny_stock_questions/
