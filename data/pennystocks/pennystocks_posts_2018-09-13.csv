**Vancouver, British Columbia** **‚Äì** **September 13, 2018** **‚Äì** **GGX Gold Corp. (TSX-v: GGX), (OTCQB: GGXXF), (FRA: 3SR2)** (the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù or ‚Äú**GGX**‚Äù) is pleased to announce it has received additional analytical results from its diamond drilling program on the Gold Drop property, located near Greenwood, B.C. Drill core analytical results have been received for 2018 drill holes EVE18-7 to EVE18-18 which tested the area of the Everest Vein, located in the Gold Drop Southwest Zone. The 2018 drilling also tested the COD Vein, located in the Gold Drop Southwest Zone, north of the Everest Vein. The highlight from these analytical results is 12.45 g/t gold and 121 g/t silver over 0.85 meter core length in altered granodiorite in drill hole EVE18-12.

The Everest Vein, located south of the COD Vein, was first discovered by Company prospectors during the 2017. Chip samples collected in 2017 across the approximate 0.4 meter wide vein exposure returned up to 52.8 g/t gold and 377 g/t silver while a grab sample of a quartz vein boulder broken off the outcrop by the excavator returned 81.8 g/t gold and 630 g/t silver (News Release of August 21, 2017).

The analytical results listed below are highlights from drill holes EVE18-7 to COD18-18 (intersections greater than 1 g/t gold), testing the area of the Everest Vein. Since true widths cannot be accurately determined from the information available the core lengths (meters) are reported. The gold, silver and tellurium analyses are reported in grams per tonne (g/t).

The intersection at 40.41-41.26 meters in drill hole EVE18-12 is altered granodiorite with pyrite. The other intersections listed in the preceding table are altered granodiorite with pyrite and / or veining (quartz and or calcite).

The 2018 drilling program also focused on testing and defining the COD Vein, a Dentonia/Jewel style quartz vein. Trenching during 2017 exposed the northeast ‚Äì southwest striking COD Vein for over 160 meter strike length. Numerous 2018 drill holes testing the COD Vein intersected significant levels of gold, silver and tellurium as reported in News Releases of May 29, June 14, June 27, July 11, July 19, July 25, August 1, August 9, August 15, August 22, August 30 and September 6. These included holes in the area of the 2017 trench and holes southwest of the 2017 trench. More significant gold intersections (core length) to date from the 2018 program at the COD and Everest veins are as follows:

* COD18-3:
* COD18-26:
* COD18-28:
* COD18-33:
* COD18-34:

10.55 g/t Au over 0.45 meters  
12.45 g/t Au over 0.85 meters

The Everest Vein 2018 drill holes are located approximately 350 to 800 meters south of the area of 2017 and 2018 COD Vein drill holes.

In addition to the gold discovered by the Company at the COD and Everest veins, gold mineralization is reported in quartz veins in the east and north regions of the property. These include the Gold Drop, North Star and the Silent Friend quartz veins in the east region of the property and Amandy, Roderick Dhu, Lady of the Lake, Lake View and Moonlight in northern region of the property. High grade gold is reported for historic samples at some of these veins with samples reported to exceed 1 oz. / ton gold. Historic gold production occurred at the Gold Drop, North Star, Amandy and Roderick Dhu veins.

Drill core from the 2018 program was geologically logged and sampled. Drill core was sawn in half with half core samples submitted for analysis and remaining half core stored in a secure location. Core samples were delivered to the ALS Minerals laboratory in Vancouver to be analyzed for gold by Fire Assay ‚Äì AA. Samples exceeding 100 g/t gold were re-analyzed for gold by Fire Assay ‚ÄìGravimetric Finish. The samples were also analyzed for 48 Elements by Four Acid ICP-MS. Samples exceeding 100 g/t silver were re-analyzed for silver by Four Acid ICP-AES. One sample from COD18-46 exceeded 1500 g/t silver and was re-analyzed for silver by Fire Assay ‚ÄìGravimetric Finish. Quality control (QC) samples were inserted at regular intervals.

Cannabidiol (CBD) Infusion into Healthcare Products Industry Growing Faster Than Expected
September 13, 2018

Palm Beach, FL ‚Äì (September 13, 2018) ‚Äì The massive impact of CBD on the healthcare product industry continues to be widely apparent as consumers increasingly show a preference for alternative methods of medicine. A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH).

Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty‚Äôs proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels.

‚ÄúThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,‚Äù commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic.

The True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.

The agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States.

Yu added, ‚ÄúWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.‚Äù

The infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Over the past two years, Sugarmade has almost completely restructured.  We have entered one of the fast growing sectors of the American economy, reduced debt levels, added a significant number of personnel, moved our headquarters, and most importantly, positioned our Company for substantial growth.  Based on our growth rates, we now believe our $30 million revenue guidance for next year is very conservative.  We welcome SeeThruEquity‚Äôs research coverage and look forward to supplying its analyst a steady stream of news on high quality developments regarding our progress.

Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) yesterday announced that Dr. David M. Feldbaum MD, Fellow, American College of Surgeons (FACS), has been appointed to the Board of Advisors for PYTG.

He is affiliated with the Memorial Healthcare System, and Westside Regional Medical Center. He is also a member of the voluntary faculty clinical instructor of surgery at the University of Miami School of Medicine.  Dr. Feldbaum‚Äôs presence on the Board of Advisors seeks to bolster its already credential-filled advisory capacity by offering instrumental input on the implementation of whole-care wellness plans, and specific case-relevant treatment plans, related to his area of expertise. Dr. Feldbaum has a unique interest in Medical Cannabis affairs and is a strong advocate of the use of Cannabidiol (CBD) products as part of a health and wellness program for many patients.

Tilray Inc.

However, in July 2018, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that clinicians will now legally be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicines to patients with an exceptional clinical need noting ‚Äúrecent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.‚Äù

GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. The Company, along with its U.S. subsidiary Greenwich Biosciences, announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EPIDIOLEX¬Æ (cannabidiol) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older. EPIDIOLEX is the first prescription pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant. Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.

The ‚ÄúKick It‚Äù spot featuring Megs McLean the founder of the ‚ÄúCrunge‚Äù music genre, (a combination of Country, Rock, and Grunge) has been a proven success and exemplifies a movement of stars and companies who support the NFL as well as our country, its civilians, and our military.¬†¬† The spot will be seen nationally by all viewing households of the 13 million subscribers of the Dish Network satellite system.

When we were given the opportunity to also kick off Thursday Night Football, we jumped at the opportunity to extend our relationship, taking advantage of never before seen values.

ATLANTA, Sept. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- True Nature Holding, Inc. (OTCQB:TNTY) (the ""Company"" or ""True Nature"") today announced that it has entered into an agreement to outsource sales and marketing of its new online applications. The software license and worldwide marketing agreement with ADL, LLC (ADL), a newly formed marketing organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. Its initial effort will be the marketing and sales of Simple HIPAA for Vets and Pets, a personal healthcare records application (PHR) customized for the pet and veterinary marketplace. It is also expected to assume operation of the Company‚Äôs ‚ÄúApps for Better Living‚Äù (www.appsforbetterliving.com) web site when it comes online in 4th quarter of 2018. It will have a virtual sales presence and may include field sales offices regionally.  


‚ÄúWe believe using a 3rd party sales and marketing group will allow us to achieve critical mass faster, and use our capital more efficiently, while increasing our rate of deployment, when compared to staffing up internally,‚Äù said Louis DeLuca, COO for True Nature. He continued, ‚ÄúOur new Simple HIPAA for Vets and Pets includes tools that will allow the veterinary providers to easily communicate with both the pet owners, and suppliers of both basic supplies and prescriptions for pets. We have custom designed this in conjunction with several leading pharmacy operators whose clients include a large base of veterinary clinics.‚Äù

Skip's Pharmacy in Deerfield Beach, Florida was instrumental in the design of the product. Phil Giordano, who serves as on the Company's Advisory Board, noted, ‚ÄúWe have a 16-year history serving the vet market, and fill over 20,000 scripts per year for our veterinary clients and their pet owners. This product set should allow our vets to more quickly and accurately fill their needs, while giving the pet owners a complete record of the healthcare records for their pets. It is a competitive solution designed for the independent pharmacy, and we believe will allow us to compete with the larger and more technically advanced peers in the market.‚Äù

In the new relationship the Company will provide hosting and software access, while ADL will be responsible for marketing and sales costs. The revenue derived from the sales activities will be split evenly, after taking into consideration normal sales taxes.  
The marketing will feature the Company‚Äôs logo‚Äôs and identification, and the ownership of all intellectual properties will remain with the Company. The new effort should be fully operational within the next thirty (30) days.

The Mission of True Nature Holding, Inc. To leverage new technologies and services to improve healthcare and outcome for individuals, their families and their pets. We believe we can reduce the cost of healthcare, while improving the quality of life using Telehealth and Telemedicine Solutions.

We are building healthcare applications that focus on: patient engagement, care coordination, remote monitoring, data analytics, and may include Blockchain RX(TM) to provide applications for market participants in healthcare through the encryption of sensitive data as a service bureau.

Our approach is to develop these business opportunities as individual ""threads"" in response to client needs, ultimately creating an end-to-end set of solutions from the end user up to the healthcare provider or veterinary professional. Further, we expect to assist suppliers to the healthcare industry by allowing them to access unique technologies that bind them with their clients in a ""top-down"" distribution model.

We recognize it will take the investment of major market participants like Apple, Amazon, IBM, hospitals, healthcare networks, pharmacy and other providers for us to achieve critical mass. In consideration of this reality, we expect to work with these market makers in collaboration and in support of the ultimate user, the individual and their pets. The day of ""direct-to-consumer"" healthcare, including ""the humanization of our pets"" is upon us and we hope to be key parties to their evolution and success.
