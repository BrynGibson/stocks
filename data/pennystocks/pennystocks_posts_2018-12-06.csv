&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to the penny stocks scene and I have some genuine questions that I believe are worthy of its own thread. I heard about penny stocks first from Timothy Sykes, and soon realized he was just selling a dream to naive potential customers. I had a former friend who was trading Forex/Bull and made a living doing it. My uncle is also a stock trader(day trader) but he has a lot of capital and make's decent money doing it. What got me interested in penny stocks is well I've always had a fascination of the stock market, but I never really had the excess capital to invest in the major stocks. I currently work as a courier driver and I'm looking to get serious with penny stocks. 

I'm looking into making a demo account, and im currently planning on saving up to $5,000 dollars as my initial capital investment. What I'm looking for is what is the best way for a newbie to get started. Should I sign up for one of these penny stock website's that have tutorials. I'm currently looking to get a membership on a website that teaches people how to trade penny stocks. I work full time as a courier driver and usually I get 2 - 3 days a week off to myself. I get days off in the weekdays as well so I can trade then. 

For someone in my position, what would you guys recommend as the best course of action?

ORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / December 6, 2018 / Toronto based CO2 GRO Inc. (''GROW'') (TSX-V: GROW, OTCQB: BLONF, FRA: 4021) is pleased to announce dramatic plant resistance improvement against common pathogens and a common predator using CO2 Foliar Spray. Bacterial (E. coli) and fungal (F. oxysporum) numbers showed a reduction by two orders of magnitude (over 90%) while a significant reduction in aphid counts was also identified.

Foliar Spray plants once infected with powdery mildew had over a 100% increase in days of plant survival post infection versus plants grown conventionally and CO2 gassed plants. The CO2 gassed plants had similar low results to conventional plants showing minimal pathogen resistance improvement using CO2 gas.

These pathogen and pest results will add to grower confidence to use GROW's natural CO2 Foliar Spray which is proven to sharply enhance plant growth and value. It could lead to the reduction of the amount of chemical pesticides, insecticides and fungicides used for optimal plant growth with CO2 Foliar Spray use.

CO2 FOLIAR SPRAY SCIENTIFIC TRIAL METHODOLOGY

Antipathogen experimentation considered bacterial (E. coli), fungal (F. oxysporum) Powdery Mildew strains and aphids (insects). Six individual experiments were conducted at St. Cloud State University under Dr. Matt Julius. Two grew pathogens directly on agar plates (one E. coli and one F. oxysporum). Four used peppers as a host for the pathogens; one used E. coli, one used F. oxysporum and one used Powdery Mildew. The sixth experiment used predator aphids.

CO2 Foliar Spray at 800 PPM dissolved was applied every fifteen minutes for three hours per day. E. coli, fungi, and aphid trials were five days long while the powdery mildew trials were 21 days in length.

With the powdery mildew trial, three variations were considered. A control, CO2 gassing at 1200 PPM, and CO2 foliar infusion at 800 PPM. Plants were infected with Powdery Mildew and days to mortality were counted for each experimental plant.

All experiments were compared with standard statistical methods and found major increases in resistance for all pathogens and predators trialed.

CANNABIS TRIALS PENDING

Several LP cannabis growers waiting to trial CO2 Foliar Spray following approval expressed concerns that its use could increase powdery mildew risk with limited Health Canada powdery mildew treatment options. These non-cannabis plant scientific results using powdery mildew prove the opposite.

The next series of scientific pathogen and predator resistance trials with be performed at two legal US cannabis facilities in early Q1, 2019. Results will be filed with Health Canada in support of approving the Canadian usage by LPs of CO2 Foliar Spray during plant cutting transplant and vegetative growth phases for superior pathogen and predator resistance.

Dr. Matt Julius concluded ''These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CO2 Foliar Spray use inhibits the growth of E. Coli, fungus and Powdery Mildew and retards insect grazers.''

John Archibald, CEO of GROW stated ""These results add further confidence to our potential cannabis and non-cannabis plant growers of the dramatic plant value superiority using CO2 Foliar Spray over no CO2 gassing as well as over plants CO2 gassed.''

Diamond CBD Goes Funny In New CBD Educational Awareness Ad Campaign
""I am THC, I am CBD"" video shorts use humor and nostalgia to dispel myths about hemp-derived CBD

MIAMI, Dec. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Diamond CBD Inc., wholly owned subsidiary of PotNetwork Holdings, Inc. (OTC Pink: POTN), and leader in hemp extraction and innovative CBD products for the wellness market, kicked off their nationwide educational campaign with a series of video shorts aimed at introducing CBD to a mainstream market. Called, ""I am THC, I am CBD,"" the videos deftly mix humor and nostalgia to reach their ultimate goal of dispelling the myths about CBD commonly held by general audiences who are unfamiliar with the extract.

The brainchild of the Miami-based marketing solutions team at Creative Propulsion Labs, ""I am THC, I am CBD"" takes inspiration from the classic ""Get a Mac"" ad campaign developed for Apple Inc. in the late 2000s. In a nostalgic nod to those ads, the ""I am THC, I am CBD"" campaign sees two actors appropriate the personas of THC and CBD, respectively, with brief but humorous exchanges that ultimately find CBD prevailing over THC in some way.

""Although the market is expected to grow to almost $2 billion in the next decade, a good number of people still carry misconceptions about what CBD is and isn't,"" said Kevin Hagen, the CEO of PotNetwork Holdings, which owns Diamond CBD. ""We wanted a way to introduce CBD to everyone; your mom, your uncle, your best friend without seeming too off-putting or too technical. When Adam Mizrahi [CEO of Creative Propulsion Labs] and the team came to us with this idea, we knew it would be a hit from the start.""

The campaign is part of a broader push by Diamond CBD to both bring CBD to the mainstream and to raise the standards of the industry as a whole. Recently, Hagen put out a call to arms of sorts, challenging the industry to become more accountable to consumers through tougher quality checkpoints. It's a movement that Diamond CBD believes they can spearhead, through leading by example.

Along with the video campaign, the company will launch a CBD Education Center called, ""What is CBD,"" which will become the official repository on the web for factual, up-to-date information about CBD. Diamond CBD has also added to its already high-quality standards, with increased product testing and increased transparency for consumers as well.

""Diamond CBD has always held to the highest standards possible within the CBD industry, placing consumers first,"" said Hagen. ""Now, we challenge the rest of the industry to join us.""

The ""I am THC, I am CBD"" campaign will be available on the web at DiamondCBD.com, as well as on other high traffic channels frequented by target demographics.

Canna Broadcast Media ""CBMJ"" continues to build the first multi-faceted media company devoted to the cannabis industry. In order to further monetize the assets and content distribution of both companies, sales efforts are being expanded to service the growing need for companies in the cannabis sector to advertise and build their brands. This focus has already had an impact on revenue generation in Q4 2018 and is expected to increase into Q1 2019.

Covered in this week's issue of Cannabis Stocks News quoted as being ""the premiere cannabis media company"" and focusing on the fact that the company continues to expand their content distribution outlets and has sales agreements in place to monetize those airings by presenting some of the big retail players in mainstream media that have had difficulty advertising on their own. Canna Broadcast Media helps solve this problem for cannabis companies needing to advertise in certain mainstream media, while allowing its investors to take advantage of the emerging marijuana market without any of the risks that plague companies involved in federally illegal activities. CBMJ has proven an ability to get advertisements for cannabis products and businesses on mainstream media. CBMJ has established relationships in Radio, Print, TV, and online on a National and Canadian basis that allow it to get Marijuana products and companies access to mainstream media in ways that without CBMJ, are currently just not possible.

Mark Schaftlein CBMJ CEO stated: ""The acquisition of the Canna Broadcast Network will accelerate CBMJs' ability to service the rapidly expanding need for Companies engaged in the Cannabis marketplace to obtain mainstream exposure and awareness for their products and companies. We are gearing up to be able to handle this influx.""

CBMJ also owns the popular cannabis news radio program ""Loudmouth News"".

(Los Angeles, CA)  The 2015 action-film festival favorite ""The Algerian"" will finally hit home video and video-on-demand release via Hannover House (OTC: HHSE) on January 1, 2019, under the title ""SLEEPER CELL: The Algerian.""  The politically-themed action thriller was directed by Giovanni Zelko and stars Harry Lennix (""Man of Steel""), Ben Youcef (""Bourne Ultimatum""), Candace Coke (""La La Land"") and Tara Holt (""Z Nation""). 

More information on the film, including a trailer, can be viewed at: [www.TheAlgerianMovie.com](http://www.thealgerianmovie.com/).

""It was important to find the right release date for this film,"" said Eric Parkinson, C.E.O. of Hannover House. ""The terrorist theme of a sleeper cell within the U.S. borders is timely and appeals to a large audience. We needed to find a release date for the video that would maximize shelf placement and correspond with consumer viewing windows. The January 1 street date catches many Americans on holiday with extra viewing time for movies, so we are optimistic that this will prove to be a successful scheduling strategy,"" he concluded.  


Hannover House released the film to 22 cities during 2015, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Dallas and Atlanta.

DVD's will be priced at $14.95 suggested retail and will be available at Walmart, Best Buy, Family Video and other major retailers of home video products. The film will also be available for streaming through I-Tunes, Amazon and other major services.",2018-12-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a3qmt8/hhse_film_festival_favorite_the_algerian_to_hit/
