A lot of ups and downs but I eventually sold at a loss because there hasn't been any kind of official news, report, or even something on one of their social media sites for nearly a year. 

More months have passed and there still is no evidence that the company even exists. People have even tried calling them with no luck, and the address listed for them is a Home Depot. 

No financials, no news, forecasts, no simple social media update, and contact information that isn't real.

I have friends who still own this stock that refuse to sell only because it use to be like $40 a share years ago and they have a dream it will happen again so they hold on to their million shares. I keep telling them to sell, especially since some are still in the green, but they won't listen. 

How is a company like this still able to exist?",2018-07-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8y7a9y/what_can_close_a_penny_stock_down_so_that_it_can/

The EnergyVIEW software application will use blockchain managed energy data at the wastewater facility

CHICAGO, July 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Epazz, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0fIgQKQ76oYaQfFTvyGdJNlzKFwHS5N9qpXs-Iz4Pk0cJ_w61g85dG_lO1iy-DwvzkfhwAJRuaw0ohy4t0eHrA==). (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company’s EnergyVIEW Wastewater Treatment Facility Software is being upgraded with blockchain technology. EnergyVIEW is an important automation component of Integrated Plant Management and Control systems.

Managing operations, laboratory, maintenance and regulatory data at Wisconsin Wastewater Treatment Facility originally involved repetitive and time consuming manual data entry. Many Wisconsin facilities were already using the IPMC MaintenanceVIEW and ReportVIEW solutions when a plant energy management project was proposed. The EnergyVIEW software application will use blockchain managed energy data at the wastewater facility. Blockchain uses a distributed ledger that demands accountability and accuracy, which prevents data tampering. The company is in the development process of upgrading EnergyVIEW. The customers will receive the upgrade as part of their annual subscription and support agreements.  

The energy efficiency improvements recently completed at the facility included the addition of instrumentation, high efficiency motors, variable frequency drives and EnergyVIEW energy management software. The software is configured with metering at each motor control center in the facility. Real-time and historical data is displayed and collected that will be submitted to a distributed ledger. EnergyVIEW provides smart energy metering and power measurement to accurately measure, store, and analyze energy data. Additional manual data on other energy sources is part of the same energy management application. The combination of metering hardware and software provides an end-to-end solution from real-time measurement to audits of the utility bills. The EnergyVIEW application improves the speed and quality of energy measurement information, so that the facility staff will be able to make better management decisions, conserve energy and reduce operating costs.

The EnergyVIEW program continuously collects data for processes, maintenance and energy data and stores it in central SQL databases. The system provides an engineering database with minimum, maximum, average and total statistical data, plus operational data for reporting. Administrative access provides the ability to create energy billing audit reports. The maintenance staff can use the system data for predictive maintenance reports and forensic analysis. Blockchain protects data input and output.

IPMC and EnergyVIEW are important tools to help facility staff verify and document the efficient operation of the Wastewater Facilities.

“There are hundreds of applications in which Blockchain can enhance our current cloud business solutions, as we upgrade our software programs we are creating new technologies,” said Shaun Passley, PhD, CEO of Epazz, Inc.

4,$HHSE MYFLIX coming soon!,8yal8f,KarmolApples,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8yal8f/hhse_myflix_coming_soon/,0,6,"All the DD needed to become an $HHSE millionaire: Read and you will understand why...From $HHSE CEO....""July looks to be a busy time for HHSE! ""

Happy Friday to our HHSE Friends &amp; Followers - Corporate movements are kicking into third gear for July, with material activities on multiple fronts, and lots of meetings and travel support.

The Launch of MYFLIX requires two L.A. trips during July - plus one web-hosting visit to Seattle. The L.A. trip will also allow for some face-to-face meetings with key MYFLIX suppliers and other major studios that we are seeking to enlist. The aggressive Q3 / Q4 home video &amp; digital release slate for the HHSE / Medallion core distribution business will also benefit from direct meetings with key wholesalers and distribution partners in the L.A. metro. And of course, we anticipate one or more day trips during July to meet with the auditors (current Form 10 project), should issues requiring clarification not be easily resolved by calls or Skype.

Hannover's original production of the Period-Thriller, THE RIOT ACT, will likely be rescheduled for theatrical release in SEPTEMBER in order to access a retail cross promotion and a College / Universities support campaign. Previously, we had planned this title for theatrical launch on Aug. 24... but the mid-to-late September date is looking more interesting. HHSE / Medallion also have two other titles for theatrical release - both planned for OCTOBER (neither acquisition has yet been announced, so out of respect for the stature of the films, the company will announce the titles via separate wire-services press releases).

With all of this exciting activity and results, some current and prospective shareholders are asking about the HHSE stock and timing. Accordingly, we share with you below the summation of notes from large traders / professional funds that have been in communication with HHSE management over the past few months.

WHY IS THIS A GREAT TIME TO LOOK AT HHSE?

1). STABILITY - Company has been in business for 25-years (since 1993).

2). DIVERSITY - Original business of BOOK PUBLISHING evolved into DVD Distribution and now into THEATRICAL and INTERNATIONAL Distribution as market conditions changed.

3). NEW MEDIA - the new MYFLIX Venture into digital streaming (www.MyFlix.com), has over 30-studio and film library participants, collectively with over 10,000 feature films and television episodic hours of entertainment. This platform will have (literally) THOUSANDS of movies not available on any other streaming site. Less than ten years ago, NETFLIX was a mail order video rental business. NOW they are among the top movers and shakers in the entertainment industry DESPITE having a very limited selection of programming for viewers. We believe that MYFLIX could be a revolutionary new streaming destination - and a massive turning point for Hannover House.

4). STOCK REGISTRATION - HHSE is currently on the ""OTC-Pinksheets"" exchange. This status has impeded some large, institutional investors and hedge funds from buying into the stock. However, the pending Form 10 filing (including audits), will elevate the stock to the OTC:QB status as an initial step towards possible further up-listing. The OTC:QB status will open the door to significant new shareholders, which most professional traders and investors feel will dramatically improve the PPS and trading volume for HHSE.

5). NO STOCK ISSUANCES / NO DILUTION - HHSE has not issued any new shares in the past three years, and management has repeatedly stated that there are no plans to dilute shareholders through any deals now in motion or anticipated in the future.

6). PRESENTLY UNDER-VALUED PPS - Based on the Price-Earnings ratio for other publicly traded film / entertainment distributors, HHSE should be enjoying a 22X share price based on earnings. HHSE is on target to realize $1,250,000 in earnings for FYE 12-31-2018. This supports a share price of $.034 at present... and does not take into account the tremendous good-will and enthusiasm factor for the upcoming launch of MyFlix. Some highly respected stock analysts have communicated to HHSE management their prediction that the company's activities could support a share price of $.15 - which is more than ten-times current pricing. Even if their predictions are off by 75% - there is still an easily justifiable share price that is many times more than current trading levels.

7). TIMING-TIMING-TIMING - The launch of Myflix is a ""second generation"" site, in that the digital streaming technology and consumer acceptance have already been established. With that essential battle already won, MyFlix can concentrate on becoming ""the better mousetrap"" for digital entertainment. You combine this ideal market timing with the company's stock registration uplist, the presence of significant new shareholders post-registration, and new distribution pacts for the company's core film distribution activities (SONY / CINEDIGM), many feel that NOW is the ideal time to take a position in HHSE shares (while the HHSE Price Per Share is artificially low). Are these professional traders right? We will all know very soon!

HHSE makes no representation, guarantee or warranty that our share price will improve significantly as a result of these and other current activities. Every stock investment involves risks and factors outside of the control of issuers and management. But we proudly share with you the above information, projections and rationale' that professional traders have identified as the basis for why they believe that NOW is a great time to look at HHSE.

DENVER, July 12, 2018   


DENVER, July 12, 2018 /CNW/ - (TSX: IMP) (ITMSF:BB) – Intermap Technologies Corporation (""Intermap"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has been awarded two additional task orders totaling $2.5 million as expansion to its previously announced U.S. Government task orders for the creation of digital elevation and bare earth terrain models. The original task order for $1.8 million was announced on February 6, 2018 and previously extended to $3.7 million on February 22, 2018. **Today's expansion brings the total 2018 contracted value to $6.2 million.**   


Separately, Intermap announced today that it was selected by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) as a member of the CACI International Inc team (Team CACI) to **develop, validate and integrate geospatial intelligence data, under a $920 million ceiling, multi-award, Janus Geography contract.** The prime contract was awarded to CACI International as one of 10 prime contractors for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity through 2028. The 10-year program will support the creation, validation, enrichment and integration of foundation geospatial intelligence data.   


In addition, at the special request of the Thai government, Intermap provided our newest and highest quality global one meter digital elevation model, NEXTMap One, to the team leading the search effort for the thirteen members of the youth soccer team that went missing in a cave in Northern Thailand on June 23, 2018. The NEXTMap One DEM was used in connection with known cave patterns to assist in determining the best-available access points and drainage for drilling locations. A high-resolution terrain model was delivered for use in visualizing and navigating during rescue mission operations within hours of the government's initial request on June 27, 2018. Three dimensional models based on NEXTMap One were prepared by Intermap, MappointAsia Thailand Public Co. Ltd. along with Chiang Mai University and disseminated to Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation officials, and used to help locate the missing children and plan for their eventual extraction from the cave.   


""We'd like to congratulate the international rescue operation, the Thai Navy SEALs and the emergency responders in Thailand on their success in locating the boys and bringing them to safety. We are saddened by the loss of former Thai Navy SEAL, Saman Kunont. Intermap was pleased to assist Thai officials and searchers to gain a better understanding of where the missing boys might be and safely extract them from the cave. It is a great example of how geospatial data and building awareness of its capabilities can bring about tremendous results."" commented Patrick Blott, Chairman &amp; CEO of Intermap.

Also, like BIOAQ, CEI has been decreasing recently and I think it may be plateauing and prepping for another run, don’t have shares currently, and wondering if it would be a good idea to buy in during after-hours, or wait and see what happens and trade accordingly. Lastly, SHMN basically just goes up 16.67% everyday lol, today was 33.33, anyone own or looking to own?  Again don’t own this either but looking at getting some. Thoughts?
