Beyond Commerce Chairperson and CEO George Pursglove commented, ""SERVICE 800 checks off all the boxes attributable to our future vision.

$BYOC CEO George Pursglove's BIO: 
Mr. Pursglove is an accomplished entrepreneur with over 30 years of start-up and early-stage business development experience. Most prominently, Mr. Pursglove has founded or co-founded four businesses that have created significant value for their investors. From 1997 to 2002, he was founder and CEO of USA Service Systems, a company which provides merchandising and assembly solutions to major retailers (and which continues today as National Product Services). Prior to that, he was a co-founder and executive of both office supply retailer HQ Office Supplies (which was acquired by Staples) and home improvement warehouse retailer HomeClub (which was acquired by Zayre Corp.). Most recently prior to leading APAI, he served as co-founder, CEO and director of BOOMj.com, an early player in social networking and ecommerce. In addition to his extensive executive experience, he has served as investor, director and/or consultant. Major experiences include seed round investments in All American SportsClub, Inc., and shopping.com. and serving on the board of directors of Choices Entertainment (NASDAQ) and Sims Communication Inc. (NASDAQ). 

Some more basic DD: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lGl0Zjjen8lQw4bJDKTZpHQ3JFVEGBFT6bXYsqGBLWo/edit?usp=sharing

There is another aspect to Boustead...they were the lead underwriter for the private placement, the 10 million dollars that boustead used to acqurire service800 and likely a few other companies. 

If George, Boustead, and Maxim convince companies bringing in significantly more revenue than 10 million dollars to merge their company for a couple million up front, that likely means the companies see the great ability for growth. 

Most OTC garbos are ""Reverse Mergers,"" $BYOC is an ""Alternative Public Offering.""
