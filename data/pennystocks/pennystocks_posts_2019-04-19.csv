0,New to penny stocks,betx0t,LordCrypto666,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/betx0t/new_to_penny_stocks/,4,32,"Hello everyone,

I would like to know how to start with penny stocks (google is returning useless results). I have close to 0 knowledge about them, and stocks in general (I started with crypto). I made a good game with crypto and I would like to put a percentage in (penny) stocks. Now, my questions are pretty basic, and I hope some of you won’t throw stones at me for asking (I’m not looking for trading advices):

1. What platform should I use? I’m from eastern EU (Romania - yeah, I know), Robinhood is not an option (at least that’s what i read). 

2. Is like crypto, where you do all your trading all day long, no order counted or amount, or I need a dedicated broker/agent? (I’m lost here)

3. Can you point me to some resources from where can I lay down the basics of learning?

Thanks everyone in advance!",2019-04-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/betx0t/new_to_penny_stocks/
