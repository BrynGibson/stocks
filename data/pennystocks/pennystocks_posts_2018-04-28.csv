2,Improved capital structure at Cision Ltd should drive stock price 40%-50% higher,8fmt2q,InterestingNews1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8fmt2q/improved_capital_structure_at_cision_ltd_should/,16,6,"Enterprise software company Cision Ltd (CISN) is trading on a multiple of 10 times 2018 EBITDA compared to peers that typically trade on around twice that. The stock has been held back by the risk of dilution posed by 26 million warrants expiring in 2022. However the company has recently tackled this thorny issue with a forced conversion that will clean up the capital structure. The stock is up around 20% since the announcement but with such a discount, compared to peers, it wouldnâ€™t be difficult seeing this stock rise another 40%-50%.
