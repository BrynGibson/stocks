**Big Dogs here:**  
**Founded  in 2015, Neon Bloom was unique from the start. DiSanti launched  it in  New York City when he was just 25—following an already  illustrious  career on Wall Street—taking advantage of new Congressional  rules that  allowed, for the first time, accredited and non-accredited  investors to  contribute to pre-IPO companies. This enabled anyone to  make a minimum  investment of $480 (1,000 shares at 48 cents a share),  DiSanti  explains.Douglas DiSanti – Neon Bloom Inc. Vision Magazine**

**“It  was a great way to raise capital,” DiSanti says. “We have really  built  one of the first grassroots efforts within the industry, and for  the  first-time, allowed everyday people to participate.”**

**Since then, the company has, well, blossomed.**
