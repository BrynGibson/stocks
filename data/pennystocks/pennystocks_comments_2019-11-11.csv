Q3 results out in 2 days and their conference is next Friday.  It will moon because they already have good news locked up. They had record revenue in q2 report with unrealized revenue for q3 that was already pushing record revenue as well. They specialize in the buildout of climate-controlled environments in the MJ industry with a presence in multiple countries as well as 10 years of experience (longer than anyone in their space). Patents on their equipment as well as new ways of steady revenue streams brought on by their new CEO. They brought him on last year and he really knows what he is doing and was able to increase cash on hand from 125k to 1.5 million while also bringing in record revenue.
