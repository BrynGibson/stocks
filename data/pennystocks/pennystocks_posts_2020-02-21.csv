7,How to trade real pennystocks in EU?,f7abi2,momchilandonov,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7abi2/how_to_trade_real_pennystocks_in_eu/,1,3,"Hi Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

To me it looks impossible to trade REAL penny stocks in EU as I am european citizen.

All stock markets I've checked don't have stocks traded for example at 0.025 or 0.002 $ etc.

Can you provide me with a stock market which has plenty of cheaper than 1$ stocks which is also comission free or has very little taxes for EU?

&amp;#x200B;

I keep seeing Robinhood / Webull / Nvstr and similar exchanges but they are closed for EU citizens or have high taxes... Nvstr wants 2$ per month for DEMO account!!!

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I mention 'real' is because I am tired of stocks at 5-20$ called penny stocks when they aren't.",2020-02-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7abi2/how_to_trade_real_pennystocks_in_eu/

18,Simple math more electric cars = more money for charging stations (BLNK). Real thought out DD:,f7epci,ChattyChris,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7epci/simple_math_more_electric_cars_more_money_for/,1,18,"first here is the updated meme  [https://i.imgur.com/gRzl4Hi.png](https://i.imgur.com/gRzl4Hi.png)   


1. There are other cars besides tesla and the other cars can't use the supercharger
2. If the supercharger is cheaper then the lines will be longer. A quick search says it cost 0.28/kwh super charger VS 0.39/kwh on blink. So it's a extra $6 for a full tank to avoid a multihour waiting period sounds reasonable. Not to mention location matters more, if the the Blink is on your way home and your only half filling the tank, thats a $3 premium. still sound bad? Even matters more is what is avaliable charging in the parking lot when you goto the grocery store/gym/ect
3. Not everyone has a driveway and can't run a extension cord through a apartment complex parking lot. or have to park down the street in the city.
4. Cost of EVs is expected to drop so more on the road in the future means a growing market.
5. As for buyout, its not just tesla, but other EV manufactures or gas stations possible (Exxon?). And whos to say blink can't just buyout/merge with chargepoint
6. Advertisments featured on the charging station is probably enough to turn these things profitable and is common in the industry.

23,KBLB thoughts,f7iyhy,Nillnornull,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f7iyhy/kblb_thoughts/,1,9,"So, someone recently brought this stock to my attention.

It's a company that Genetically modified worms to create GMO spider silk. They have greatly expanded production in the last 6 months, and expect to produce yields year round and have a shipment plan. They expect to grow.

They have over 800 million shares, and on yahoo shareholders have stated a proxy for a 40 to 1 reverse split.

It's currently 11 cents, half a year ago it was 50 cents. If they rally before a RS it's worth it to buy in now right? But if they RS at a lower or equal price it's not worth jumping now? 

Also after a RS many companies follow with an offer and dilution, they also only own 1%, not sure but they may try a buyback of shares at some point also.
