While this offering will lower the share price, it will also allow the company to fuel growth and become more attractive to potential investors.

There is a shareholder meeting tomorrow morning as well, not really sure what is going to happen with that.  I've heard rumblings of dilution and all kinds of shit, which could prompt more people to sell, which can be a domino effect.  This is especially true in penny stocks where paper hands are everywhere.  

With the TV providers and streaming services they're partnered with, coupled with the aggressive merchandising they're rolling out, this should continue to rise and be an easy hold.  June 15 at minimum (that's when they launch Kartoon Channel).

Also, the CEO has surrounded himself with really solid people for both the production of the cartoons and the merchandising roll-out.  For example, take a look at the creators of Rainbow Rangers https://i.imgur.com/sHIRjPY.png

Can't find the list of the people involved with the merchandising, but it's people hand picked from Hasbro, Mattel and toy manufacturing leaders with a plethora of experience and pedigree.

When you declare and hopefully secure a loan, you have the ability to operate in the short term which is a positive, there's still a chance to right the ship if it hasn't sunk yet. Additionally, while shareholders are typically the ones that get shafted and lose everything, there's a chance that the restructure in a way that rewards existing shareholders with the newly formed shared after bankruptcy. 

Because of that, ""vultures"" can come in and buy large stakes at next to nothing, and then be rewarded with new, healthier shares on the other side. It certainly doesn't always happen, and like I say, shareholders are usually the ones that are screwed, but it's a small price for a potentially big payoff. If you're a big investor got extra capital it can be worth it in the long run. If you're just messing with petty cash, it's a long shot at best.",2020-05-15

Im thinking about buying in but i can see their support line is about 0.35-0.38 so im waiting for it to drop to that level and hopefully that will cause a low-price-rejection and maybe make it spike with some potential news in the next 2-3 months.

That being said, it‚Äôs honestly what they‚Äôd call ‚Äòbeginner‚Äôs luck‚Äô. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt defy the odds. You did a very admirable thing by taking this break after being up $5k, because most people would have just blown it away chasing for more. So maybe you are different than the average trader.

It‚Äôs up to you how much you want to keep this $5k. Maybe you withdraw your original money from the account and just use the profits (ie house money) to trade for a while, or even less. Or maybe you continue to go full force, or maybe you go smaller to try to learn the nitty gritty and refine your strategy to show yourself how you‚Äôd handle different kinds of situations (eg a trade is in the red, when/how do you exit?, etc). You found yourself on the favorable side of the pump this time and rode the wave up, but unless you know someone on the ‚Äòinside‚Äô who has an active role in pumping any given stock, you have no way to guarantee if you may end up buying right before the dump or not. So that‚Äôs where risk management (ie what would you do if it was red and you need to cut your losses) comes into play.

Because you are being completely devoid of empathy. Every response you're giving reaffirms that.

What you could have said to OP: ""Hey, thank you for the information. What do you think the risks are associated with $ASRT?""

What you instead said:

&gt;It isn‚Äôt DD until you make a section considering potential risks and assess the probability of each risk scenario using originally sourced data.""

That's a douche response. Frame it however *you* want to. It's blunt, rude. 

You can have all the logical intelligence in the world, but if you don't have any emotional to realize you were a dick to OP, and how you're obsessed with being ""right"" above all else, then that's not something I can teach you. You're going to have to do your own ""DD"" on that.",2020-05-15

It will happen with any broker if you have a margin account. If you want to day trade and you do not have 25K to deposit then open a *cash account*. Robinhood does not allow this. Most brokers should. 

I use Schwab, you can open an account directly through the app (Individual brokerage/non margin), but I am not recommending them. They're not bad, but it's all I've used, I have nothing to compare to to form an opinion. I do have some complaints, the app is kind of buggy, but it's not enough to make me switch. Do your own research if you care about features and shit though, all I will say is they have essentially zero fees. 

On some stocks every now and then there may be a small fee, but I've only seen it once, it's very rare and I can't find any reason for it. OTC stocks have no fees, even gray market stocks have no fees. For that one exception though I can't say there are truly zero fees.",2020-05-15

I've done a bit of DD, but nothing as thorough as this. On one hand, they do have confirmed partnerships with the likes of Disney and Wynn, and they're technology does seem very valuable, especially after the pandemic. On the other hand, they're just now releasing 2019 financial results on the 28th and are supposedly in a good amount of debt, so their earnings are somewhat suspect.

It gives you a few options, the first is an individual brokerage account (a cash account) or a margin account. Thats the first two options, then it has things like IRA and whatnot, I didn't really look beyond that to remember since I just wanted a cash account.

I actually way overspent a few weeks back and got a 12k margin call on my then $1200 cash account so I think as far as how they're handled they're basically the same, but on the books it's a cash account and I've never gotten a complaint for PDT as a result. 

Since then I haven't spent beyond my means (I didn't realize I was spending unsettled funds previously), so while you can technically buy on margin with them with a cash account I wouldn't push my luck. I'm sure they'll either make you switch to a margin account or penalize you if you abuse that privilege, but it's nice to know they do allow a bit of leniency. Don't abuse it!",2020-05-15

Solid point re: Fidelity:

Furthermore, one of the largest and most sophisticated asset managers in the world, Fidelity International, recently confirmed their approximate 9.5% ownership stake in the company. While certainly not speaking for Fidelity, we believe that since they were the largest investor in the A$4/share equity raise for GetSwift in 2017, returning to the top of the shareholder register is quite likely also an endorsement of their belief in GetSwift.",2020-05-15

You sold 4 of those contracts for $10 each.

In the time since you sold the contracts, TTOO has gone up in price, making it more likely that it will hit $2.50 then when you wrote the contracts. Each of those contracts is now worth $13. Making your ‚Äúreturn‚Äù on the 4 contracts -$12.

There are now three things that could happen:

1. The price on Nov 20th is below $2.50 and the contracts are worthless. Congrats you made $40and still own your 400 shares. 

2. The price on Nov 20th is between $2.50 and $2.60. You can buy the contracts back at market price for less than what you sold them for. Congrats you made money and still own your 400 shares. 

3. The price on November 20th is above $2.60 and you have to sell 400 shares at less than the market price. Congrats you made the difference between $2.50 and whatever you bought the shares for, but any price increase above $2.60 makes you no additional money because you no longer own those 400 shares.


Generally you would sell a call when you expect the price to go up. Pick a strike price at your exit point. If it goes past that you ‚Äúlose‚Äù potential gains but you would have sold the stock there anyways even if you hadn‚Äôt written the option. If the price goes down, you already made money selling the option so your breakeven price is lower than if you hadn‚Äôt written it. 

This is called hedging and you will notice that it is an actual method of limiting risk rather than the bullshit of selling out of winning trades and holding on to losing ones in the hope they turn and break even that passes as risk mitigation on this sub.

The first thing to do is acknowledge that the method of making money is known as picking pennies in front of a steam roller, if you aren't completely covered.

Essentially you agreed to sell 100 shares of TTOO at $2.50 if the underlying stock moves above that price. You wrote 4 of these contracts, so you will really be selling 400 shares at $2.50 if you get assigned. This is great if you have 400 shares now; because if that happens you get to ride 400 shares up $2 ($800 profit). 

Where this becomes an issue is if you don't have all 400 shares to sell if you get assigned. In that case; you are still obligated to sell those 400 shares at $2.50. So if you had say 55 shares; you'd profit off the $2 gain from those 55 shares but you'd be obligated to sell 345 more shares to cover your contract. IF the stock goes beyond $2.50 you will have to buy in at a higher price and sell for a loss.

In either case you have collected $10 premium for each contract ($40 profit); the premium for these contracts however have now risen to $13 for each contract; meaning you're technically down $3 per contract you sold; if you wanted to buy to close your position. Alternatively; you can play the long haul and make pocket all $40 and keep the shares if this stock stays below $2.50...

In a best case scenario you want this stock to rise to $2.49 and not pass that until your expiration date.",2020-05-15

In that case, if you want to sell your 400 shares, you have to buy back the contract (will cost less than you sold it for) before you can sell.

Selling *covered* options is fucking great because even when you ‚Äúlose‚Äù you have still made money. Buying options is risky as hell because you‚Äôre betting against all that.

1. FDA approves the treatment and were all rich as it should have the potential to surpass 3.50. But the suits will sell once the stock peaks resulting in a large dip causing a chain reaction and we lose what could‚Äôve been a huge win for us.

3601,Cicero1982,fqp6piz,/r/pennystocks/comments/gk3sw3/how_to_track_data/fqp6piz/,1,Shorting mid to low floats is HIGHLY risky. You could lose over 100% of your short position on one solid PR release. For example. When bankruptcy rumors were reported for MDR a lot of people shorted it. Then it was announced they received a deal with the banks and additional financing. If anyone shorted it they lost 200%. Months later they finally went bankrupt but you are asking for some serious risk here. But if you insist on moving forward you will not only need access to data and research but you will need to access the history and chances of solid pr.

Decided and implemented a new, some would argue revolutionary, way to market to the masses. During the time of transition they laid off employees/managers that were of the ""old way"" of doing business. And, they got their ass kicked by COVID-19.

They lost revenue due to the transition &amp; COVID, however created new branding technology, BrandGraph, which caused a ""cash burn"" During that time they als teamed up with **MAJOR** brands (Subway, Levi's, Comcast, Whole Foods *\*cough Amazon owned\**, Target, Ebay &amp; more)

Do I understand how their growth plan feeds into how they make money?

Revenue must be increasing with margin staying relatively even or decreasing, operating expenses lower than revenue. 

They don‚Äôt need to have positive EBITDA yet, but must have a clear path to getting there and be making progress.

Dilution must be under control. It‚Äôs ok to raise capital, but it needs to be going to long-term process improvements rather than short-term operating expenses. 

Debt should be reasonable. Preferably with little to no variable price conversion.

P/E under 15.

&gt;Based upon the above assessment, we concluded that, at the date of filing the condensed financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next 12 months without securing additional funds and, therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the date the condensed financial statements were issued. Additionally, we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.",2020-05-15

I was in for a little more than I wanted to be, but at this point I was willing to lose it all in the hopes of the bankruptcy announcement would shoot the stuck up, I know crazy idea. My trailing stop triggered at .23, hats off to the short seller right of the bat that dropped price from .25 to .23 in a split second, also, I hate you. Probably cost me .03/share but profit is profit, especially since it came from a company that is going bankrupt.

I feel like their share prices dropped this week because no one likes uncertainty. People want to feel like they know what something is going to do. So, I thought the bankruptcy announcement would help their price. Unless I missed something, what their announcement really said was, ‚Äúoh, well we took some time to consider our options and we are still considering them.‚Äù That was enough to pretty much double the share price from .16ish to hi of .31ish. 

What I am planning on doing is waiting to see if they stock comes down around .15 again and then I will probably buy 1,000$ worth and hold it till there next announcement. I would only be doing that because I feel like the hype from whatever they might say in the future would drive price up some. I do not trust this stock long term at all and I would not buy it at its current price. 

Obviously all of this could be wrong an the price could only go up from here &gt;.&gt;",2020-05-15

Don‚Äôt try and chase the wave, as it might already be at the top.  Just because someone says ‚Äú$1 for sure‚Äù don‚Äôt trust that. If everyone says something should hit .80 for example then I set my limit sells for .77.  Basically lock in profits when you can.  When something is being super hyped on here that means everyone is already in, so if there‚Äôs a catalyst for something (earnings, PR) I might get in, but otherwise I personally see it as I missed the boat.  At that point I‚Äôm trying to see what the next boat is gonna be.  I also payed attention when folks said what their entry points were and if they were way lower than I could get in then I would skip to the next stock.  Basically it comes down to don‚Äôt FOMO your way into a bad position.  When you‚Äôre locked into what stock you want to buy then you want to watch the chart and see where the dips are and where the support is. If it keeps going down to a certain price and bouncing up from there then that should be your entry point.  Set a limit but for that price and then wait for it to go through.

I‚Äôm in some experienced traders‚Äô groups and the majority of them bought in when it crashed Friday AH. Robinhood not allowing people to panic sell Friday was probably the best thing that could have happened to them. These are just my opinions, as always do your own DD. Good luck!",2020-05-15

Maybe that's why I'm always feeling great just thinking about what I'm gonna do besides give some coprorate entity 40+ hours a week and compensated shit.

I actually feel like I will live off grid and self sustaini before I'll waste my life to eventually have greedy people in power flush your dreams.

So face the future head on, you do what you find rewarding and fills your soul up...if it's minimum wage but you come home so prideful everyday, fuck the status quo.  

You get to help write a new one.  I ask that you really think about where you can help make an impact for the ones who will one day be coming into the real world 

It's a scary time but opportunities really are endless!

It's okay to get discouraged but do what makes you happy   If anyone tells you different, tell then Jesus himself commanded you to on a sub and carry on üòâüòÅüôè‚úåÔ∏èü§û",2020-05-15
