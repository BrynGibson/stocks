0,Scanning paramaters for Penny Stocks?,cpldqa,Dave_Trader,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpldqa/scanning_paramaters_for_penny_stocks/,6,8,"Think or Swim, Finviz, etc. 

I am a semi-experienced trader and I have scanners set up for day- and swing trading. But I think that these scanners do not necessarily work with penny stocks, maybe because there are much lower volumes of retail trading and much higher volumes of HFT. 

Tips would be greatly appreciated!


Happy trading!",2019-08-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpldqa/scanning_paramaters_for_penny_stocks/
1,Dubious Traders...,cpphi4,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpphi4/dubious_traders/,0,0,"It's a shame to read the likes of many gamblers who erroneously believe in their fantasy gambling addiction over logical thought. I'm not going to specifically preach my credibility. Perhaps these traders get a rise out of it, similar to when stocks spike. It's almost as if, maybe, thinking about what the other person is doing, the guy you're competing against on the other side of the screen, will amount to more. Problem is: associations toward correct actions will have self-correcting postulations overtime. Meaning  if you're a trader starting out, you may create incorrect reasons why a stock is rising or falling. To say, for example, as stock is down for ""this reason"" is falsifiable because there's likely a myriad of variables that caused the stock to drop. People in highly emotional states are exploitable, which is why buying long when everyone else is will fail overtime, because someone on the other side is exploiting it (shorting).",2019-08-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cpphi4/dubious_traders/

I like what I see with the company, but the spinoff of the fuel company to a OTC exchange complicates things for me as I made the purchase through a Canadian TFSA which does not permit the benefits of a TFSA to apply OTC holdings and, in fact, imposes a stiff tax penalty for profits made on those stocks.
