The open comment period on the FDA’s ANPRM ends July 16, 2018. To date, major medical associations, government agencies, tobacco insiders, and the public at large have submitted nearly 3,000 public comments to the FDA. Although some companies in the tobacco industry have requested a 90-day extension of the comment period and have facilitated hundreds of “form letter” comments, the responses from scientists and regulators have been overwhelmingly in favor of the FDA’s plan to dramatically reduce the nicotine content of cigarettes. As the only company in the world growing multiple varieties of Very Low Nicotine flue-cured and burley tobacco varieties, 22nd Century makes possible the FDA’s vital new plan.
