Also, I‚Äôm new to this, but what does it mean if there‚Äôs CEO‚Äôs, CIO‚Äôs, and other people who would be considered ‚Äòinsider‚Äô traders selling their stocks? For example, ARE‚Äôs CEO sold $1.45 million worth of stock on 8/6 and their CIO sold $646,155. 

Also, what does it mean if two major shareholders of AMAG are buying $1.9 and $3.03 million? 

I know things start to get weird right before market crashes and if we‚Äôre expecting one soon, What should I take away from insider trades of buys or sells? Or am I thinking too much into it haha.

Appreciate your help üôèüèø",2019-08-11
