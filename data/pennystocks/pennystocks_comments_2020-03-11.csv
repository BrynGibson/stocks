If they worked this out while it was in the .30-.40 range it was a great deal for them at the time and now that it’s in the $2 range it seems shitty, but since the papers were signed they had no choice to announce it anyways. Better to drop the news now and take the hit than in a few days if it ran even higher. 

Now they have time to bounce back in anticipation of them receiving the emergency FDA approval everybody is assuming they’ll get. 

The price is holding around $1.95-$2 premarket since the news dropped which is a good sign. But if there’s a massive sell off when the bell rings I’m gonna take my profits and look for rentry.

Liabilities is basically anything owed to another person such as creditors.  However, a lot of companies use liabilities and debt to leverage themselves away from paying taxes (just stating this to explain why liabilities can be good in certain ways).   Anyways, say you have a house,  it's worth 300k, and you're in 30k debt.  Your cash flow (job or source of income) dries up and you default on your loans.  You end up going through bankruptcy and you liquidate all your assets.  Lets say you sell the house (liquidating assets) to pay off the 30k debt.  You're still left over with 270k. 

Assets minus a companies liabilities equals shareholder's equity.  In this scenario it's $7b net assets, $4b net liabilites, and $200m market cap (was when I got in at least).  You take $3b divided by the market cap, $200m, and you get a 1500% difference.
