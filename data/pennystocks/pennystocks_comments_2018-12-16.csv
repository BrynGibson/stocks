I think this company would be best suited as an educational institution, teaching established pharmacist about the benefits of cannabis. 

If they are able to streamlined education and then going to places like Walmart pharmacy to help their staff better setup the patients, This Is How they will win. 

I've got an old school train of thought. I think if you're smart enough to buy your weed on the internet, you don't need a doctor's help.

This type of stuff is better suited for in-person type of people. Seniors getting off of traditional medication and onto cannabis who want directions when picking it up at the pharmacy. 

But can they get these contracts? Or will it be a bigger player in America taking them.
