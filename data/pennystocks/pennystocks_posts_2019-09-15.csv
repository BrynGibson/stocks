0,Heres how you develop a strategy,d4hhlo,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d4hhlo/heres_how_you_develop_a_strategy/,1,0,"Many people have messaged me over the years asking about how they should develop a strategy. Many of whom seem to describe themselves as a blank sheet. It's easy to point in a certain direction, and say draw this on your sheet. You see a clever marking ad how you can make money quickly in the stock market. Perhaps you see some clever post about a company that looks incredibly promising. This is all an illusion. Once you understand this illusion you'll be able to find instances of it inside the market, and use it again't others to profit. People all rushing buy orders to make money, because ultimately it'll fulfill the fantasies they desire. Unfortunately, under very emotional circumstances, they'll be the first ones to bail if that fantasy becomes a nightmare. That's the strategy. It's an art. 

I have written a few times at the never-ending problem of these so called ""helpers"" who'll sell you dreams for your credit card. It's selling you dreams. It's bogus. A bunch of hot air that amounts to nothing. They never teach about the art of trading. Shameful on the marketers part, but they aren't entirely to blame. Press releases are designed the same way. They sell a fantasy of what could be. The price will go up and *you'll* make money investing in *our* company. All tactics to bait in buyers. It's fantastic for liquidity, but not great for those who perhaps don't know what they've invested in. As long as someone has the *illusion* of choice, they'll still make the trade. Master the art of trading by understanding and seeking proof.

Happy trading-
