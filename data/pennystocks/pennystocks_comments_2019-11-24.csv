A stock hitting an all time low can keep making all time lows for an entire year following the initial ""bottom"". Of course if you truly believe in the company and think it's going to recover  you can hold onto it for the long run.

Before even entering a position you should know what risk you are willing to take and modify your position size accordingly.

Never buy and hope. Have a plan and follow it.",2019-11-24

Sometimes on Robinhood you can buy or sell in premarket.   Iâ€™ve had buys go through as early as 6:00am.    Itâ€™s iffy.    Well one of my stocks jumped up big pre market and I decided to sell.   My sell was as low as .20/share as it rose pre market.   Then about 9am, it tanked to .10 below closing price.     That was the last straw for me.    I work 3rd shift and up that early every day, thatâ€™s why I clearly remember when transfers go through that early.
