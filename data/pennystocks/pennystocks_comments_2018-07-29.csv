7,DesignPrime,e398iln,/r/pennystocks/comments/92x8w3/list_of_roboticsbiotech_pennystocks/e398iln/,1,"I feel like everyone is so quick to callout the ""Hai'esque' shotcaller"" in Mithy and Yellowstar when TSM looks terrible. When they looked amazing on past EULCS teams, everyone attributes their success to great leadership qualities of these players. The only constant I see in these two cases, is the management as well as Bjerg, who is such a passive player. What makes Mithy and Yellowstar so much worst after they joined TSM?

The two most successful iterations of TSM I saw were with Lustboy and Biofrost. Both of which are players that had a hard time speaking up and took much more of a backseat role and let the mechanics do the talking. The reasons they gave for kicking Biofrost was communications issues, and they said he wasn't the shotcaller they wanted. Well, anytime they have tried to put a shotcaller in the support position, it has backfired. 

I see two problems inside TSM. one being the orgnization's management and the second being Bjerg. First off, TSM's management leniency with Bjerg. He is proven that he has a inability to be the proactive leader of this team that he is made to be, yet TSM keeps him around split after split. When they have a aggressive ADC like Doublelift and Turtle paired with a more mechanic heavy support, thats when Bjerg's flaws are covered. They keep trying to shove the support into a leader / vocal shotcaller but this has always backfired. This is why I think Bjerg is a problem for TSM. 

Second, is the management. It also blows my mind how the TSM organization doesn't see this correlation between their successful and unsuccessful iterations given how much resources they have. They decided to get Zven/Mithy which is one of the most passive botlaner combos. Rekkless and Doublelift also confirm this point about playing vs Zven/Mithy",2018-07-29

His company and and the filings he's thrown at the SEC for the name change/reverse split are more likely to get them taken off all exchanges PERIOD rather than actually getting approved for the split and name change (which was suppose to happen months ago). Fuck that fucking slimey piece of shit, fuck his Twitter handle where he religiously spews bullshit, fuck the SEC for allowing people like him to say things that flat out are not true to con fuckboys like me into giving him my life savings.
