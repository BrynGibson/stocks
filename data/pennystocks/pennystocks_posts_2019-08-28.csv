ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 28, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AVRA Medical Robotics, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCQB: AVMR), an emerging growth company that is in the process of building a fully autonomous medical robotic system through the use of new technologies combining artificial intelligence, machine learning and proprietary software; announced today that its regulatory and management teams met with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 12th. The Company’s robot arm has already won approval in the EU and received the CE mark. The Company has begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for US, Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for AVRA’s modern medical robotic system – a ground-breaking approach to medical robotics. The Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP), which the Company is employing, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to the six most important medical device marketplaces.  


Barry F. Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, “We were pleased to have a foundational dialogue with the FDA on August 12th to discuss the unique capabilities of our robotic system, which combines artificial intelligence, machine learning and proprietary software, and is designed initially for the aesthetics market. We expect this meeting is the first of a series where the AVRA system and all regulatory requirements will be discussed in ever-increasing specificity. We appreciate this opportunity to meet with the FDA and we intend to work together with the FDA to ensure that all quality and safety requirements are addressed from the earliest stages of development. We believe that this will allow AVRA to prioritize the most meaningful activities, saving company resources and time. We look forward to updating the investment community as we move ahead.”",2019-08-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cwmzjx/avmr_avra_medical_robotics_initiates_food_and/
4,Trading is simple.,cwltwu,invcht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cwltwu/trading_is_simple/,1,3,"Trading isn't simple for most people, but it can be with the right approach.

Many of you are using way too many indicators and you probably don't even understand how your indicator exactly works. 

Here's a VERY simple way to analyze a chart without MACD,RSI,etc.

Ask yourself who's stuck. Trading is all about taking advantage of supply &amp; demand imbalances. If there are shorts stuck, clearly you'll want to be long. If there are longs stuck, clearly you'll want to be short. If you have too many longs trying to get out hitting the bid without enough demand to cover it - the stock is gonna fade. If you have too many shorts trying to get out smacking the offer without enough supply to cover it - the stock is gonna rip higher.

Now that sounds simple enough - but how do you KNOW who's stuck? Take a look at a longer time-frame than your intraday chart. Look at the daily chart, hourly chart.

Here's an example on DMPI: [https://imgur.com/5VpPWgo](https://imgur.com/5VpPWgo)

You can see the previous runs traded much more volume so there was an overwhelming amount of supply on the chart + the current demand couldn't handle it. People trying to get out from previous runs.

A good way to forecast volume is compare the current run's first 10 minute volume to the previous day - also keep track of this data in excel.  Collect volume at various times of the day and relate it to the end of the day volume. Do this for a few hundred tickers that faded all day and find an average common denominator. Use that number to project the volume live at those same times.

My challenge to you would be to trade for a week with absolutely no indicators besides the chart, volume, and level 2 with time &amp; sales.",2019-08-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cwltwu/trading_is_simple/

9,You Don't Need This...,cws674,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cws674/you_dont_need_this/,6,3,"I get many daily PMs about whether paying for a day trading service is worth it. Most information you'll find is free. In fact, almost all the content you'll ever need is free, or presented in a book. While some preach about the idea about speeding up education by paying for it, it's not necessary. 

It's up to you to decide what the appropriate cost of a program is. Some other posters on this subreddit have their own chatroom, with a pretty steep fee. 

Let's discuss the promoters tactic. He will use his followers to promote is own gains. The reason why this works is he will pick penny stocks with a low float as they are easier to control, once you get enough clueless suckers, you have your own pump and dump army that are unaware of it and even pays you by the month. If a bunch of mindless morons trade what you say, you buy in big, tell them to buy, price goes up, then you leave before them. You look a hero for making ""picks"" but in reality it is your followers that actually make them work, cause and effect are not what they seem here. He scalps his ""students,"" or whatever he calls his chat group. To the ones that become bag holders like many will, he could say ""yeah, man I told you to get out, it's why I sold when I did, I saw this coming"" and act the innocent party that was ""right"" about a stock's direction, not that you it was really you that actually manipulated it and the cause of the drop. I do wonder why after so many years of seeing the same tired old scams, played the same way by the same types of sleaze, they always get new suckers. There are many like the promoter and it nearly always works the same way, the more sophisticated version tries to pump some special trading software, or through a chatroom service. These programs are all the same thing, re-branded. Some are more sophisticated than others, but all serve the interests of the operator.",2019-08-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cws674/you_dont_need_this/
