Just look for the biggest movers with unusually high volume (usually biotech stocks) that are getting pumped hard. Then find out what news is driving the price up...you have to be able to distinguish what is awesome/legit news example being FDA approval for a drug that cures cancer with a very high success rate, or the company is being bought out at a much higher price than what is current etc...or mediocre news such as a companies drug has just entered early trials of FDA approval or the company has barely regained compliance to be listed on a major stock exchange (i consider this mediocre only because the price jump is almost always temporary). obviously dont touch the ones with great news...only short the mediocre pumps. Enter it short and wait...i tend to set a loose mental stop as almost every time the price will drop well below your entry within a week. I do hold overnight sometimes which is bad practice and even worse on occasion i hold over the weekend...i am currently holding MGI over this weekend and up $425 on my position and expecting more on monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Shorting pennies is risky but i have had a much higher success rate using the method above than taking long positions. Better traders than myself set a tight SL and never hold overnight/weekend but i think the level of timing for pure intraday requires more skill and experience than i have, (meaning they are better at picking the tops/bottoms so realize higher profits in a shorter time frame).

29,Bubbs77,esf8fed,/r/pennystocks/comments/c7g9tc/ttcm_videos_on_youtube/esf8fed/,1,"I hope it so. I’ll be a millionaire if it does. However it’s not likely that it would get that high for some time. Right now the stock is pretty low. Like half a penny. When the app rolls out it “should” get a decent spike. Then it will probably drop to a new level of support until other catalyst surface. If the app is well received by the public it could go pretty high I would guess. It depends on how popular the thing will be and how fast knowledge of the app is spread. Wish I knew all the answers because if I did I’d be typing this from and island somewhere instead of at work. But you have to research and study and then take a chance. Personally I’ve taken the chance and I really believe folks will miss out on a good opportunity when this thing hits the public. It may flop shortly after but I’m confident it will make a nice strong run when it first comes out. Strong meaning anything above .10 cents. 
Here’s an example. this stock is at .0048 right now 
$1,000 gets you 208,333 shares
If the stock goes to .10 you get $20,833
If it goes to only .05 you get 10,416

I personally am holding a million shares. 

This is what makes penny stocks so awesome but you have to find the ones with potiential. I personally believe this one has it. I base that on my own research which is what you or anyone should do before risking your own hard earned money. 

Good luck",2019-06-30

    If you are right and they consolidate I may not see the profits I’d like to see. But I could still see s nice return if they are successful.
  If it takes longer  than expected to roll out then I may be holding a bag for longer than I wish. One upside to that is if I had to hold longer than a year then at least my capital gains would be reduced.

47,born2rock4life,esh0zok,/r/pennystocks/comments/c7avmu/what_are_some_strategies_on_shorting_a_penny_stock/esh0zok/,1,"To be honest, unless it's a NASDAQ listed penny stock, I wouldn't touch it unless you have 100k+ with InteractiveBrokers or CenterPointe Securities.

&amp;#x200B;

With TDAmeritrade (ThinkorSwim platform,) I can short penny's, but only NSDQ listed. OTC is not supported from what I understand.  That said, other brokerages I've heard that can support it with lower account values, typically have some high borrow fees, on top of already high commission fee's, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you should try your hand at it, with or without heeding the above advice, here's what to look for;

&amp;#x200B;

* Abnormally high price for a penny stock that has a history of a parabolic rise and then fall.  --- Make sure there is NO BIG NEWS that is moving the price and justifies the price.  This is fundamental financial research. If it is hype news, it's usually safe to assume it's pump and dump.  But a buyout/merger and other big news with legitimate sources / proof, those are examples of BIG NEWS which can cause the price to hold/run.
* Wait for the first red day after a parabolic rise for confirmation to short.  I.E.; CTRM, BPTH, etc. when you look at it on the 4hr / 180d chart. 
* Gap-up's after being halted.  Usually you can spot the end of a parabolic rise after one or even several halt/resumes of a stock that's trading over double it's previous close price.  When there's a gap-up after it resumes, it can be more times than not be expected to come back and fill the gap later.
* Any Biotech pretty much at IPO that doesn't have an existing FDA approved drug/distro line. This would likely be a longer-term swing trade. But, they raise funds for R&amp;D at IPO and are always burning through cash, so SP will go down over time based on fundamentals. When they run out, they dilute and continue to devalue SP, so the biggest threat to their financials is failed clinical trials and FDA denying approval. Unfortunately most smaller biotech's will not receive reach/complete meaningful Phase 3 clinical testing, and should they, it's hard to garner FDA approval statistically speaking unless it's a breakthrough drug or meets primary and secondary end points and exceeds them.
* This is more of a blue chip stock, but some penny stocks will be reviewed time from time by investment firms.  When a stock is upgraded/downgraded, usually the day of/following day will move accordingly in the direction in which the movement occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

You can easily blow your entire account if you're on the wrong side and don't understand how to leverage risk with shorting. If you used 1/2 your buying power to short and the price doubled up due to a quick influx, your account will be margin called and effectively closed out with a zero balance. Research and understand how to trade in steps, manage risk, etc. if you haven't already.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have for now, but best of luck.  I highly recommend you take a few months at minimum using demo accounts / paper trading to practice shorting penny stocks.  Being able to understand how shorting costs add up faster than typical long share purchases, as well as how important it is to cover quickly if a trade doesn't go your way.",2019-06-30
