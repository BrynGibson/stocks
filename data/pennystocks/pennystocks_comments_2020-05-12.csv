When properly employed, this resource can provide reliable and up to date information about any company in the world. This fountain of financial facts has the ability to transport you to the boardrooms and accounting offices of startups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Do you want to know if that merger is really happening? It can tell you. Do you want to find out why that stock price is slipping? It has knowledge. Do you want to know if that penny stock is another PnD or a real opportunity? It can tell you. Do you want to know what that wacky Elon Musk said on Twitter today? It can even tell you that. 

$MRGE gets contracts for oil and gas infrastructure projects on a regular basis. The last one announced was in October of 2019. The latest contract they were hoping for, possibly the one mentioned above, has been revoked until further notice-indeed partially due to the current pandemic. The $MRGE discussion group is full of hopeful bag holders who wanted to believe that this was finally going to trigger an increase in share values. Unfortunately, like thousands of other perfectly good business enterprises, the global pandemic has fucked everything up royally. They‚Äôll keep fighting and hopefully survive the year.

Then there is the fact that their race has some top notch racers like montoya, vettel last week, button, solberg and so on. They also somehow got deals with espn and eurosport for broadcast of a 3 hours of virtual racing on saturdays. It's pretty impressive for a company not even listed on a real stock exchange.

It‚Äôs not a get rich quick method, but after losing money trying to invest in random pennies with hype. I learned to actually pick my stocks bc I love the company. You can still do this with the same budget. 

Turns out you might make money quicker than you expect to by following this strategy too... I‚Äôm up from 1k to 1.6k the past 6 weeks... 

PLUG: a) the company I work for has a significant contract with them, and my company works with NASA, DOD, VOLVO, Tesla exc. but only winners...
b) hydrogen has potential for huge impacts on the energy sector.
c) they are closing some significant contracts and interest from other major entities 
d) oil has a time limit

FCEL: b,c,d from above

NIVDA: not a cheap one, but they are way ahead of the game in a market that is undoubtedly going to explode. 

MU: somebody has to compete with NIVDA

F: Ford isn‚Äôt going anywhere and they are releasing electric trucks in the relatively short future. 
b) they are at about 60% market value from before corona 

VTIQ: somebody has to compete with Tesla and they are a bargain. 

This is a short summary of the DD I‚Äôve done. &amp; it should be enough to convince you to make some money.

There are lots of technical traders that will trade within the signals given by charts. So sometimes no matter how good or bad the news is, the bulls or bears will take over based on their own TA.
It's good for assessing overall risk. News and other DD can outweigh the chart signals, but bearish/bullish charts are something to put on the scale to determine whether you want to enter a trade. 
Like for IZEA. I see a strong bearish symmetrical triangle about to break around the 14th, but with earnings on the 14th and product release webinar on the 18th, I'm taking the risk of holding despite the chart, since volume and hype will likely move against technical trader's effects on price movement.",2020-05-12

What is greed? Wanting $5,000? Nope. Too little. Too tame.  It's not that simple. It's always 'greed' when you lose. Yet its a seer, the sage, the quantitative guru of 'market intelligence' when you win. Emo run amok is the loss. Nobel prize  in Economics to anyone who gets a 10 bagger. 

Gambling is not greed. It's thrill. It's ok to blow $1,000 in Vegas on some slot called, 'Dildo Charmer.' Many will say they have fun playing, even thou they loss. Yet in the market, a bad trade is different. It feels more professional. 

Remember, the market, as Burton Malkiel popularized is a 'Random Walk.'

I propose that not selling when you had more 'money on the table' is a function of trying to claim the great prize of the perfect price. The top. Ditch it to the ""Greater Fool."" be the pig, not the hog. The thrill of the action. 

Good luck. 

Even the greats can't sell at the top. 

In June 2015, Carl Icahn sold his 1.5 million share stake in Netflix. CNBC praised his decision as savvy. The day he sold, panicked traders dumped the shares. 5 years later, Netflix is up 400% and Icahn left 1/2 BILLION dollars on table. That alone would have made him one of the richest men in states like Utah, Mississippi, etc.

Remember, the market is essentially a fake apparatus. It's predicated on the success of the United States Dollar. Greed are actions that debase the latter: negative interest rates, unlimited Fed bond purchases and the likely hyperinflation. 


All this market shit... Look where it's got us... Rich men now develop plans for all humans. 

Greed is when the complexities of some Masters of the Universe (George Soros or Bill Gates), men who manipulated Foreign Currencies and floppy drives, start dictating our future with their rich thoughts.

What started as covid testing buzz has morphed into a potential treatment solution through cedar sinai, new testing sources when china was delayed, hair loss products, distribution rights with south korea....the list goes on.

alot of news required moving forward, eua/fda approvals for covid testing and heallight. status of shipments etc. 
I think this will get a boost after earnings but maybe not 15+% a day or swing trader might desire.  I think this has potential to be 3$ by eoy easy, and if heal light works as advertised....it could be unbelievable.

Look at all the tickers that are ignored. Start looking up random companies or sectors (diversify if you can) and look 1 month ahead. This is how you get in early. You need to read global news, keep up to date on trends. Use information to your advantage.

I know some might say ""oh, but Microsoft acknowledged that it is a rumor floating around so there must be some truth to it!"".

But she literally tacked ""with no truth"" at the end, so be careful guys.

More info in this thread from the MVIS sub:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gifxz8/mvis\_microsoft\_webinar\_5122020/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gifxz8/mvis_microsoft_webinar_5122020/)

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, this pump was a gift for the bag holders to finally get an exit point. But for whatever reason, people still keep thinking long with MVIS. You only have yourself to blame if you didn't take it.

I myself wish I left today instead of last week at 0.70.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it's in Microsoft's best interest to literally just wait until MVIS is close to dissolving and just buying them out at 0.01 a share when there are no rumors circulating and when MVIS is literally begging Microsoft for more business. These are what these Tech Giants do. They are bullies.

It is risky to buy when RSI is above .70 typically. Obviously nothing is concrete. You said  ""RSI is dropping now too so it's too risky for me"" which confused me. RSI dropping from the highs is typically expected. RSI dropping through the 70s, 60s and so fourth signals a downtrend, risky to buy in and catch the falling knife, maybe that's what you mean and I just misinterpreted? 

&gt; So is the ideal buy I'm at below 0.3 but it's okay when its in the middle? 

Generally yes. I love to buy things near 40 or 45 RSI with positive upwards momentum.",2020-05-12

The reason they dropped made sense but I just felt the company could at least rebound from $1.60 a share. It dropped from $13 or so in short amount of time. It had jumped prior to now but never like this. I found this sub later and saw no one was talking about it. I figured it was just an obvious mistake.

Only been doing this two months and can share what I've learned as someone who was completely new to day trading and really the stock market overall beyond set-it-and-forget-it long-term holds. I do benefit from a financial professional background though for fundamental analysis, but technical analysis is a lot more important for day/swing trading. 

On my default charting setup, I have basically incorporated [a hybrid of studies I saw in Youtube videos and articles](https://i.imgur.com/OGXrcpH.png) including Fibonacci moving averages, volume average, RSI, and stochastic oscillator. 

&gt;would buying below 50 rsi be a good strategy? Seems like it‚Äôs a very uncommon thing?

To finally answer your question, I don't rely on any one factor to make a purchase decision. I look for the stochastic oscillator to be in a downswing (&lt;30), RSI in a downswing (&lt;30), strong volume, etc. then I have to also consider those variables across different time periods. This is key. If you zoom out on a chart, the RSI, etc. adjust. That's why this stuff can be so complicated - you have endless potential studies/charts/scanners for looking at the data then multiply it by infinite time periods that are constantly updating 24/7. 

This is all purely chart stuff before ever considering the context for why the stock is tanking, the company's fundamentals, and why it may or may not be a good decision to buy.",2020-05-12

I go to the screener and sort by price. I google the companies and see if they look like they‚Äôll have news coming out soon.

For instance, I meant to buy BNGO yesterday at open partially due to seeing this when I googled them:

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/04/2027121/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Adds-Healthcare-and-Genomics-Industry-Experts-with-Experience-in-Commercialization-and-Reimbursement-to-Its-Board-of-Directors.html

I‚Äôm torn on buying Oragenics, because I feel like their stock didn‚Äôt go anywhere near as high as it should on this announcement:

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200504005255/en/Oragenics-Acquires-Noachis-Terra-Develop-TerraCoV2-NIH-Generated

But yeah, basically a stock screener that lets you sort by price, volume, industry, etc. then just google around. If you want short term flips, then you just need a company that looks like it will announce something soon. If longer term, dig into their financials and yearly guidance.

For instance, Akers should be making another announcement about their COVID vaccine soon and if I remember correctly they still haven‚Äôt announced their 1Q. They are technically a penny stock since they are under $5, but not what this sub usually calls a penny stock.",2020-05-12

In general I wouldn't be surprised if the market is most busy right at open. As swing traders we bank on swings though, we get into trades anticipating future trends, and thus volume. In most of my stocks if it's going to do well a common trend is volume picks up after I buy it over the coming day or days. If it peaks in the morning and then only goes down from there that's generally a sign to me that the stock is coming down off a run rather than about to take one. There's ofc other factors at play so you can't take that without context, but that's a general pattern I've noticed over the past couple of months which is as long as I've been trading. 

If I am wrong please correct me, I am still learning a lot so I may well be, but that's what I've witnessed and it makes logical sense. So far I've just had one or two people say I'm wrong without 
 reason to justify it so I'm not going to change my mind just because someone says so.",2020-05-12

* Take profits quickly and don't hold into the dump
* Holding onto the stock to let it ride

Which also, important to note, becomes the answer after the fact. In other words, no one has any clear strategy on when to sell. This is because they're gambling without any defined strategy. Don't take Robinhood users advice. Period. OP has no idea what he's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In fact, if you‚Äôve done your DD, and a know the stock should shoot up

&amp;#x200B;

Stupid on many levels. Doing DD will not make the stock price go higher. It only gives the buyer the **illusion** they're in a good position. DD is nonsense for most traders in pennystocks, because they were going to long anyway. Who cares if they've done research if they're coming to the same conclusion regardless? Playing these games on yourself, not going to get anywhere. Bagholder city.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You should HOLD, because if you‚Äôre patient, you‚Äôre more than likely to grab some gains for a change instead of losing because of fomo for other stocks you‚Äôve already missed the TRAIN on.

Jeffrey Ubben valued them at potentially $100bn: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/03/04/valueacts-ubben-this-is-the-next-billion-dollar-company.html

Look up Ubben - he's a pretty impressive guy. 

VTIQ could've merged with other companies. They valued NKLA at $3.3bn which is $10 per share. So its more then doubled based on potential already. TSLA IPO'd at $17 so I wouldnt look into that TOO much. 

For arguments sake lets say its currently valued at $6.6bn - how much of their $100bn potential will they reach?

NKLA are poised to win a lawsuit against Tesla stealing some designs. They're not a fake company. They're not vaporware. 

They merge in June. Thats around 3-4 weeks worth of hype before the final merger. What will the market do between now and then? No idea lol. I am hoping it goes to the moon. Will there be a pump and dump? No idea. Will there be some proft taking on the way? Probably. 

Will it peak at today? I'd be surprised.

You appear pretty smart with this stuff. I‚Äôve tried to catch your twitch streams a few times but it never lines up. I‚Äôm normally feeding the kids and baths around that time. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm a total noob at this. Started on 30 April and by dumb luck I‚Äôm sitting at $204. I initially deposited $150. Do you have any standard advice or tips you give rooks?

I‚Äôm noticing other than the lucky ones, I get in a position, watch it go up a bit, then dive back down for a small loss. Usually 3-5% loss. And since I‚Äôm not spending much we‚Äôre talking 4 or 5 bucks but over time I can see that being a problem.

 Current Price at .39c to .42c.
Pre- covid at 2.72 to 5.70.
During covid at .70 down to .39

Realistically? It might jump .60 this week and dip back to mid .50s... might even pop tomorrow. There's too much hype for mvis and ktov that some might miss this gem.

It's a good investment for those not wanting to check on the daily pump and dump.

Sabby owns a lot of stocks and if he shorts, he can buy in at a lower price.  


But short selling usually implies that one borrows the stocks. In that case he owns the stocks, so the share needs to go up and then he sells it. But for what? If the stock behind it is solid, it will rise.

Example: Sabby and KTOV (5/6/2020)

KTOV engages H.C. wainwright (the placement agent) to raise capital for the company. KTOV raised $10M. The placement agent fee is 7% issuance amount ($700,000) and warrants to purchase 1.75M shares at $0.50 per share. 

Sabby gives the company $10M. In exchange, they receive 25,000,002 shares with 25,000,002 warrants which allow them to re-purchase shares at $0.40 for the next 5 years. This means Sabby‚Äôs purchase price per security was $0.40. 

At the time of pricing (5/6/20), they purchased stock at an 8% discount to the market. On the closing date (5/8/20) however, it looks like Sabby‚Äôs cost basis was at a 10% premium to the market price. One might think that Sabby was immediately underwater on the date of closing. However, according to the documents, Sabby is allowed to open a short on 5/6/20 for the 25,000,002 shares they just agreed to purchase, but will not have purchased until 5/8/20. The 2 day window is crucial here. Those 2 extra days allows Sabby to sell the difference between their purchase price and the market price in order to hedge their position before even having shares in their account. This is legal, and a common practice amongst players in the space such as Sabby, or Hudson Bay. 

Now it‚Äôs 5/8/20, and the shares are in Sabby‚Äôs account. Sabby still has their short open. Now as the price of KTOV runs up, Sabby Can safely continue selling shares of their position and locking in their profit. Once they have sold all 25,000,002 shares, they can still make profit off the warrants, which allow them to do the same deal again. If KTOV goes up to $1, Sabby has locked in the right to purchase shares at $0.40. 

In some cases, if the company were to ever issue equity at a price below $0.40 per share, Sabby‚Äôs warrant redemption price would reset to the lowest price the company issued shares at. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case here though. 

This type of transaction is called a registered direct. Companies issue registered shares directly to an investor at an agreed upon price, which are immediately free trading upon receipt of the shares, via an S-1 or and S-3 (shelf) registration.

Regardless I think it still has room to pop even as a hold.  All other casinos should take note, other theme parks, etc.  Some more news/rumors will drop this week.

EMAN probably will be another one as their competitor.  I just don't think this part of the sector has been pumped enough yet, let alone the fact they do have Wynn and Disney.   

Disney will hurt, those orders however won't, just more training time with it etc.

I plan to buy mark on dips possibly up to Q2 earnings, probably some EMAN as well.

This is a bag i don't mind holding if need be but i see a bigger profit in the short term.  I want to take that some profit and get some more VTIQ on its inevitable dip.  If it's priced in over 18-23 moving forward then I learned a lesson today.  I went with my gut, research and feeling today.

The main thing to note is that the price is more prone to wild fluctuations because its harder to track and the latest price is simply what someone is willing to sell a share for.

All further development efforts for RP-G28 have been suspended, until such time as the Company determines a path forward. The Company is continuing to explore monetization opportunities for RP-G28 for the treatment of lactose intolerance, including exploring a variety of commercial routes.
¬†
On January 15, 2020, Ritter entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ‚ÄúMerger Agreement‚Äù) with Qualigen Inc. (‚ÄúQualigen‚Äù), pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company will merge with and into Qualigen, with Qualigen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
¬†
If the merger is consummated, the combined company does not intend to continue the clinical development of RP-G28. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the Company and John Beck, the Company‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer, acting as the initial contingent value right (‚ÄúCVR‚Äù) holders‚Äô representative and in his capacity as a consultant to Ritter, will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the ‚ÄúCVR Agreement‚Äù), pursuant to which, each stockholder of record as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the exercise of any outstanding stock options or warrants and the conversion of any outstanding preferred stock, but not to be adjusted for any reverse stock split to be effected in connection with the merger) will receive one CVR for each share of common stock held by such stockholder, entitling the holder to receive the net proceeds, if any, from any sale, license, transfer, spin-off or other monetizing event of all or any part of the Company‚Äôs RP-G28 intellectual property or technology (a ‚ÄúLegacy Monetization‚Äù) that is entered into during the period beginning on the date the Merger Agreement was signed and ending on the third anniversary of the closing date of the merger. Under the CVR Agreement, the combined company agreed to commit up to $350,000 (subject to reduction pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement) for certain expenses to be incurred by the Company in pursuing and closing any Legacy Monetization. The CVRs will not be transferable by the holders of CVRs (‚ÄúCVR Holders‚Äù), except in certain limited circumstances, will not be certificated or evidenced by any instrument, will not accrue interest and will not be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) or listed for trading on any exchange. The CVRs will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Time (the ‚ÄúCVR Termination Date‚Äù). No payments with respect to the CVRs will be payable in respect of any Legacy Monetization proceeds actually received after the CVR Termination Date by the Company. From and after the CVR Termination Date, any further proceeds received by the Company arising from any Legacy Monetization will be retained by Ritter and will not be distributed to the CVR Holders.
¬†
The Company may not be successful in completing the merger. If the merger is not completed, Ritter may seek to pursue the development and commercialization of RP-G28 as either a prescription drug, OTC product or dietary supplement for the consumer healthcare industry, which would, in any case, require significant additional funding. If Ritter is unable to obtain funding for the development of RP-G28, whether through potential collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements or otherwise, it will likely be required to cease operations",2020-05-12

Novavax was, 4 years ago, about $190/share.  It was, until FEBRUARY of this year, 40 dollars per share. Then it went down like a rock to 4 dollars per share. Unbelievable, I wish I did buy in then... 

But... I bought in at 22.22. Monday evening, a global non-profit dedicated to eradicating dangerous infectious diseases (almost totally focused on covid now) threw up to 380 million dollars at Novavax to help boost production of vaccine candidates to 100 million doses by the end of 2020. 

So, needless to say, I am holding on to that one. It doubled to 40/share on Monday and held very steady for Tuesday. Wednesday is going to see a spike that follows, I am presuming, the same pattern that Moderna has seen, as a similar company receiving similar grants. 

Overnight, Novavax's market cap went from about 200mil to 2.4 Billion.  

I also have my eyes on WORK (Slack) for long-term. Fair value estimate I think is way undervaluing it. The entire professional world uses Slack. Also looking at Nintendo for long-term. 

For short-term, I'm looking at TTI again, and I expect SRT (Startek) to bounce with the other business-facing services. Was at 7 and change before the crash, and is at about 3.50 now.  Very low volume, though. 

Anyway, yeah... I was just watching Novavax all day because it made me 3 thousand dollars overnight. The books looked very good -- I saw one buyer at 20k shares for $40.00. 

I think Novavax will probably closely follow what Moderna did -- I am betting 8k on it doing so.",2020-05-12

in at .42, out at .56. 

Then I bought TTI over the weekend and made another 2k selling on Monday. 

Then, on Monday morning, with my proceeds, I bought NVAX at 22.22 (not a penny but did spend some time at 4ish in the past months, hit its all-time low...). 

I'm now holding NVAX for about $7400 having purchased at what seems an incredibly low price now, as it's around 40 during the day Monday, and holding very stable for Tuesday. 


If it does what Moderna did (skyrocket a number of times) I am fairly confident it will... I should be looking at 200% by next week if not more. 

Then, I think I may play it safe and go for NDOS or somesuch until another obvious opportunity shows itself. 
Regardless of their performance over the next 72 hours, these seem to be actual companies, doing actual business, selling actual service/product. They will grow in time. 

Word to the wise: I bought grubhub like...2 months ago when this all started...and sold because it wasn't IMMEDIATELY returning. 

Well now Uber wants to buy them and they are mooning for real. 

Now, if only one could find actual, good food on grubhub. Far too easy to fake it in my experience (5 orders, 3 pizzas, 1 of which was not abysmal, lowest possible effort garbage, and it was pretty fucking close...).

I am actually pretty interested in Lyft at the moment, and not because of Uber's play...",2020-05-12
