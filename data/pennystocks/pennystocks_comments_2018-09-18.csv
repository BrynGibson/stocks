Which covered all of what I bought in during this round. But made a lot more during first post from .1174 initial buy of  425899 shares. Will buy in further next week in 5 to 10 grabs. Then lower holdings temporarily and in big before earnings call. But will be timing this stock all the way to $4. It will continue to be very volatile for the foreseeable future. But you can also just buy and forget it. But you earn more if you get out on spikes partially and back in on dips. Setup stop loss and limits etc good luck,2018-09-18
