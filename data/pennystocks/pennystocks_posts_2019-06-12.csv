LAS VEGAS, June 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE ‚Äì International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCPK: ISBG) (‚ÄúISBG‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a top-tier brand incubator in the Global Wine &amp; Spirits and CBD-Infused Products markets, is excited to announce the acquisition of CBDforSell.com, a strong presence in the affiliate marketing industry with a focus on the hemp, cannabis, and CBD marketplace. The acquisition was all-inclusive and financially non-toxic for ISBG shareholders, with the Company now owning 100% of the CBDforsell.com site.  


üì∑ISBG PR June 12  


‚ÄúWe are serious about building a strong affiliate marketing segment,‚Äù noted Terry Williams, CEO of ISBG. ‚ÄúWe fundamentally believe in the affiliate marketing movement and we have tons of synergy that will spring from this acquisition given that we are also producing and selling a wide range of premium CBD products that will directly benefit from a now in-house marketing business with prepotency in the space. It makes all the sense in the world for us right now.‚Äù

Management notes that the affiliate marketing space has become a dominant online and mobile avenue for product awareness and sales, now accounting, for example, for more than 40% of Amazon‚Äôs $100 billion in annual sales. The affiliate marketing space is expected to grow to nearly $7 billion in total size in coming years, and over 80% of online sellers now make use of the strategy for at least some portion of sales.

Affiliate marketing is an online commission advertisement/marketing process where affiliates get a piece of the revenue pie by turning up leads that actually result in sales. Businesses involved in e-commerce have become highly dependent on affiliate marketing because it gets results and the overhead is managed on a performance basis. At this point, the strategy has become so popular that, on average, affiliate marketing generates over 20% of all online sales, according to thebrandonagency.com.

Mr. Williams continued, ‚ÄúThe affiliate strategy is a growth market because it offers a cost-effective way to grow online sales and brand awareness. But it also offers a faster, more efficient route to strong search ranking and a massive crop of targeted customer data. The fact that we will be able to meaningfully ramp sales of our own products is just the cherry on the sundae.‚Äù",2019-06-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bztq2c/isbg_acquires_emerging_affiliate_marketing_site/

No wonder they been quiet lately - this is a MASSIVE deal. It all makes sense now.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone last night in Discord group found a new filing from BEMG. They are officially moving forward with a name change to MBO holdings inc. Name change alone will put this in dollars. I think massive merger on the horizon.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, in the new filing, it shows their share reduction is now complete, so there has been a 75% reduction in outstanding shares. We have a big mover here.",2019-06-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bzr2se/bemg_huge_news_out_partnering_with_brokerage/

SEATTLE, June 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- ReelTime VR (OTCPK: RLTR) a pioneer in the development of Virtual Reality programming and technologies is developing a Virtual Room for consumer and commercial use. The revolutionary rooms utilize 4K video walls, floor, and ceiling fueled with ReelTimes' patent pending technology that can create any environment desired.  


üì∑REELTIME VR 360  


The Virtual Rooms can have the consumer sitting on a couch in a traditional living room with and desired d√©cor one second, and then transport them instantly to a white sandy beach, high rise penthouse, or even orbiting the earth from a space station. Furthermore, the ReelTime Virtual Rooms (RVR) can be combined with other rooms to provide inhabitants of both rooms to perceive that they are in the same environment as if they were there together.

ReelTime is currently in talks with a major state of the art hotel and condominium project to incorporate virtual rooms as a major attraction for the development. Guest will be able to change their views and decorum to their taste and owners of the condominiums will be able to enhance their units with any combination of virtual windows, walls, or complete rooms. Imagine being in a normal sized room that all of a sudden appears to be massive or even completely outdoors and having the ability to change that as if you were changing channels. Of course, you could be watching TV on whatever size TV you chose or even enjoying one of ReelTime VRs award winning VR shows such as ReelTime VRs No. 1 award winning Virtual Reality travel series ""In Front of View"" starring international superstar Front Montgomery and her daughter Leonie Montgomery, or the tween VR series ""Really Twins"" which is viewed in 49 countries.

Barry Henthorn ReelTime VRs CEO stated: ""The convergence of technologies in the AR/VR space is emerging in ways that are creating realities that could only be conceived in science fiction just a short time ago. Hopefully the new era in communications will bring people closer by providing them with the ability to connect, reversing the trend so many have embraced of retreating into solidarity. We are very much looking forward to sharing this new innovation based on our technologies and experience in the VR and communications industries.""

ReelTime VR is a pioneer in Virtual Reality technologies and has received patent-pending status from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for their non-provisional patent application covering apparatus and method claims for technology involving simultaneous capturing of 360 X 360 degree Spherical Panorama Images and Video.

In a recent article published by Virtual Reality Insider [www.virtualrealityinsider.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=D57qL_QZetQ8FnsQc9aeYjE_3u-4xuucgGa-S0FEig1opWkxRIu0iBiJZ6znaqTnr8CHsh5g97haNOIglAYh_7x-SLuf2-A7Vl1ILlDBbiVy8HlQ02AAk_932LIZCodP) it stated: ""Companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, Facebook, Google, and Sony are investing heavily in the infrastructure and technologies fueling AR/VR and are allocating significant R&amp;D budgets towards their development. Microsoft alone reportedly has over ten thousand AR/VR patents filed across thousands of patent families. ReelTime VR however, may have the most significant of all AR/VR patents currently being processed in the industry having filed a very broad patent.""

The patent for the technology was also featured during a Bold Patents spot on CNBC during Shark Tank and was referred to as having the ""power to shift entire industries"" by J.D. Houvener, author of ""Bold Ideas"".",2019-06-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bzt6cb/rltr_reeltime_vrs_new_reeltime_virtual_room_may/
