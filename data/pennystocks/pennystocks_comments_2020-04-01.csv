What I usually did was make a watchlist of the ones that ended up having their daily volume increase and do a little DD onto why it might be happening. Do they have an upcoming important date ? Expected Data ? did a world event happen ? Is someone pumping it? etc etc. Based off that information, I would then make a decision to either go in and wait or to wait and see if it's possible to get a better entry and if the volume continues to rise. 

I do recommend Webull for Newer users, since it does give you the option to switch to ""Contracts"" if you so want to later down the road.

In penny land you would either have to look at news throughout the day and before market open to find a good day trade play or you needed to be researching to see if any stocks have had their volume increase recently.

What I do every day before market open is do a search for the top most traded(volume) stocks so far in Pre-Market and go from there. Now, since you only want to play pennys, you can easily do that type of scan but omit any stocks that are above, let's say $5 and it would give you a nice list of what to look at.

Do your DDs, **quit relying on business news because the market dgaf.** 

A company can beat earnings and drop, or not hit targets and still rise.

All the information you need to know when to buy/sell is contained in the chart. Use indicators to extract that info. 

Even with all the updated news in the world, you still need technical analysis to know when to jump in and out.

I exited at a loss today, may load up if it hits .02 again just for the gains with possible FDA approval but this is not a long term hold imo.

One thing I find comical is, if this company has been around for 20 years why aren’t their diabetes test more widely available in the US. Suddenly they are going to become a major player in the market for a deadly virus? It also doesn’t appear that DECN is producing anything and just outsourcing to Korea.  With most of these tests being produced in Korea what is to say there won’t be a shortage of supplies by the time DECN is ready to start production. The FDA is approving test that are ready to go to market immediately. They aren’t going to give much importance to a test that won’t be ready for market for a couple more months lol. So many things can go wrong and everyone is hyping this company up as if it’s a sure bet.",2020-04-01

Stop fuckin complicating it! Just focus on making profit. Try different strategies. Find that stock with good volume that you can flip consistently.

**Get acquainted with indicators**

They’re called that for a reason, as they literally tell you when to buy or sell. Now, there’s technique to it or anybody could get rich off it, but all the data has been crunched and neatly presented in a few lines.

If you’re on Robinhood then you know you have to hold for a day. So don’t waste you’re time looking at the minute or hourly data when entering a position (buying a stock) You want minimum 2H, ideally 4H, and you can go higher depending on how long you want to hold. The point here being you want the stop to be going up, or about to go up when you buy.

Now after you held for a trading day, dive deep into the minute and hourly data so you know when to exit

The whole point we’re here is to make money. So if you’re green, you’re doing good. 

Watch live crypto traders as they *must* rely on technical analysis (buying and selling only based on price action of a stock) to decide when to jump in and out. And if you wanna know why that is, it’s because crypto doesn’t have all the information a publicly listed company must provide

The only way you perfect when to buy and sell is by buying and selling. So asking *me* when to sell is stupid. Do your research, develop a strategy, and then the question will be when do *you* want to sell.

Because this is an art. Your cash is the brush and the stocks are the canvas, just whatever you do, put some damn paint on the board",2020-04-01

On non-OTC markets institutional investors are huge, think pension funds, insurance companies, etc. Normally they buy stock in the accumulation phase over very long periods of time (Years). However since OTC markets don’t see the buy/sell volume like the larger markets institutional investors can be those with just significantly large pockets. Large enough to affect the price based on their supply. 

I’m not saying there is an institutional investor involved in this stock. There might not be, but if they are they work hard to mask their moves.",2020-04-01

Just read the post and the 2 main takeaways for me personally are 

1) volume 
2) news 


I've set up my scanner so that early mornings it detects volumes that went up like 120% in the last 5-15 mins and that has proven very useless. Its given me really good stocks, but for reason I didn't trust my scanner. I'm new to scanning so I was wondering if it was a good scanner. 

With news, sometimes before you jump in you have to also see the volume. Yesterday I jumped in AGEN the second the news came out they were doing something new with cancer treatment. I waited, waited, and waited for hours. Nothing happened! Next time I'll watch volume.
