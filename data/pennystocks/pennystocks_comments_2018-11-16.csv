I would say this stock will increase since they just hired a host of sales personnel. A lot of these medical penny stocks get bogged down because they are almost always still waiting to be approved to sell and thus are not making any money.  This company got approved in September so they look like they are ramping up to sell hard in the US. They do thermal burn treatments which makes the timing of selling in the US interesting. With the holiday seasons coming up a lot of people are going to burn themselves cooking those big meals or starting fires in he fire place and getting burned that way. Plus with the wildfires raging in California there will be a lot of need there. Personally, I have been burned by medical stocks too much to want to go back in but this looks like a good buy.

Essentially, there are, to my knowledge as of yet, 3 ways of making money. 

1. Options
2. Day trading (beware of Pattern Day Trading).
3. Long term (holding for raw gains or holding for raw gains + dividends).

I personally prefer option #3.

I recommend watching videos that explain the dividend economy of making gains. 

Simply put, divs are fractional profits that a company first declares and distributes (two different things that are very important for planning, if serious), either monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually. Keep in mind though, high dividend yield does not always mean it‚Äôs going to be a great payout stock. You can gain $1.10 on a $3 stock with idk like 15 shares or something, but you can also see the price of the stock go down $0.12 per share. Erasing your gains + additional loss.

So by study, when you watch materials like, in this case, how to invest in dividend stocks on youtube. Watch some Warren Buffett speeches with an open mind, you‚Äôll come to one simple buffett rule and a question: why would you put your money in a company you knew wouldn‚Äôt perform well and or generate income?


I forget the direct quote but the basic idea is, don‚Äôt invest into a company you think wouldn‚Äôt do good in the future. If it doesn‚Äôt do good, it won‚Äôt make profit, meaning dividend cuts, or erasures.

Sorry for the long post. Good night from my side of the world.",2018-11-16

So if you wait until the price peaks and then sell in that instance; do you just get the money then and there? Do you have to wait 2 days for someone to come along and be interested in what you have? It just seems like you wouldn't be able to make money by timing your sales just right unless there happened to be people on the other end hungrily waiting to buy up your shares. ",2018-11-16
