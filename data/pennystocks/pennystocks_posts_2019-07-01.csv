Based on the growing conditions, soil and vast amounts of land available to our venture, we feel there is potential for billions of dollars of CBD products,” stated Ferraro.

He continued, “Among the strategies to be announced soon are the plans to build a state-of-the-art distillery/refinery on the property for product production and global distribution. Mayan has international relationships that add value to the existing U.S. and Canadian relationships of Preferred, that should yield strong sales and ROI for our investors.” Since the consideration of this project, the Company has received multiple contacts for product and contract growing opportunities.

As grower, producer and provider of wholesale and retail CBD and Cannabis products, the Company intends to become a robust contender where legal in the U.S. and abroad. “Our approach to gain land in strategic locations will allow us to penetrate the market without restraints that most will face. We have a focus on soil and temperature, as well as ease of shipping and receiving of finished products,” Ferraro said. “We want to be the company that anyone can call for product 365 days per year and we can deliver. We want to be able to contract-grow for large corporations and deliver when they need it without having to wait until the next growing season, and Belize is a great add-on to this approach.”

Holding all your savings in cash might seem a sensible and safe option but in a low-interest rate environment, your funds will grow very little. Inflation too could eat into your savings as it can impact your purchasing power. Even if your cash savings have gained a little interest, the money in your pocket could be worth less due to inflation – for instance, that 2.50$ double espresso you start the day with could suddenly be costing you over 3$. For example, investing in equities, bonds or property can offer a good opportunity of growing your money over the longer term. Indeed it is a long-term approach to investing is generally accepted as being likely to provide the most benefit. Whether you start paying into a personal pension when you first enter employment, invest in an ISA while still in your twenties, or invest on behalf of your children, the earlier you start the better. Even small regular payments each month into investment funds can result in a sizeable pot after 20, 30 or 40 years. Rather than have to scrape together school fees or watch every penny in retirement, your prudent investment planning could ensure a more comfortable and less stress-free lifestyle.",2019-07-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c7qeuq/the_benefits_of_investing/
