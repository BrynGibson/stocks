What does this mean, at present time this service could help better triage patients for minor issues helping not clog up er’s amd urgent cares with minor issues. However, im skeptical until people have devices (smart watches, etc...) that can provide some basic diagnostics.

Many micro and nano cap size stocks tend to produce negative returns which make short selling profitable when trading penny stocks.

Do some micro and nano-cap stocks make it big? Some stock betting on them long term make it big, yes, but that is one out of few hundreds. You will find more stocks that have a bad performance and negative returns meaning short selling is a more lucrative and pragmatic way to trade these small stocks.

But I would like to tell that those short term high flying low floating penny stocks are good to day trade on the long side as well. Like $MBOT one of the stock to mention from these past weeks. But you need to be equipped with the real-time screener and give away more screen time to look for opportunities when pulling the trigger...

So just by putting 100$ to trade 10 random penny stocks is a bad idea because if you accidentally will hit one big runner (which is most of the time 100-300% per few days) out of all others you would end in big minus.

So you must find and trade stock within that short time window to catch the bigger move and that will take more time screen and quality setups to find if you interested to make money by buying penny stocks short term.",2019-01-23
