I'm going to take a guess though on what is happening with the b/a. I think that number is in shares and is primarily 1 investor that is putting 50k on a penny, that is a hell of a gamble (this is an assumption though because I didn't see the l2). My fear would be that whoever is on the bid is planning to scoop up the .0003 to start pumping it than sell at .0005 which is the current ask. This one trade would profit him over 33k. 

I really am just taking a guess though. This could be legit with massive potential for all I know. I am going to put it on my watch list and I look forward to seeing what happens with it. Hope whatever you decide works out in your favor. Happy trading!",2019-05-29
