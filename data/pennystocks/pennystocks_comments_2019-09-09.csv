1,brad__staple721,ezmhi4a,/r/pennystocks/comments/d1jnlf/trading_is_difficult/ezmhi4a/,1,"In my experience of working on a farm, in restaurants, real estate, insurance, and recruiting, there aspects about every job that are difficult.  Each at varying degrees, and not necessarily comparable to the other â€” just difficult in their own right.  Until you figure out what you do well in those jobs.  And when you play a sport, there are guys you play with/against that are better.  Either all the way around or in certain ways.  And sometimes you just canâ€™t compete with them at all.  But what sports and all my different jobs taught me, you have to figure out exactly what your strengths are and focus completely on that.  Hone those things that make you able to compete and succeed, and stand out.  What can you bring to trading that is unique to your experience and what you do well?  Focus on that.  Everything else is just noise that doesnâ€™t help.",2019-09-09
