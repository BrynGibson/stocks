I enter sell order for .50 to wack the bid and instantly sell, but IB ""price caps"" the order to say .60 ""to prevent extreme price fluctuations"".... 

I'm pretty sure I have to option of calling them to override. But still annoying sometimes... and if you are a TA guy you probably only trade stocks with regular trading volume, so wouldn't come across the same issue.
