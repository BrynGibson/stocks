SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Nu-Med Plus, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R1g9sIBuOOARlc-guTPZZXeWDk-kg7C4aUSSgXqvHydJL6J0OjCLdV-F-fKMnHAcuHkaTufLZLERuFciTALQog==). (OTCQB: NUMD), a medical device leader developing new nitric oxide delivery technology, announces that Dr. Ronald Day, a pediatric cardiologist at the University of Utah, will incorporate the recently developed Nu-Med Plus 100 nitric oxide delivery device into a yet-to-be disclosed research study.  


Dr. Day is a prominent researcher examining, among other studies, nitric oxide to treat children suffering from pulmonary hypertension. Dr. Day recently spoke with [*The Life Science Report*](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K_fuHhpCxNpJ6laiG4gO69bp6P4yNdmKPBXGLZX6fNko_hVbsuqPSVnF5WlLu-niHF1vLgObh2T8bJ_h7ERG0m0BT0xRyX-YPAKsVuInBYLtXJ10hiYZKQ28_Drie2cojKSUmLjX-Y_CqixRWz4_V20rpunufNC2FdEcEiUFs2lAnK25tUV6VYkrAmPVax81448-HJ1KJpCufkLXoSCtaSwAYtAYUszkWa5L2YQDgOjuNI1LxfQtq5VZDzS1bHCmUl3FiVMgM4AWOdMJBzLX9A==) where he discussed the benefits of investigating nitric oxide treatments. Dr. Day is not receiving compensation for utilizing the Nu-Med Plus product.

Nu-Med Plus recently developed the Nu-Med Plus 100 (NMP 100), the world’s first nitric oxide dilution system purpose-built for research. The patent-pending technology utilizes 100% pure nitric oxide from a pressurized tank and dilutes it with precision controls to provide a 1 to 5000 ppm source of nitric oxide for research applications. Dr. Day has already received the research unit from Nu-Med Plus.

Jeff Robins, CEO of Nu-Med Plus, remarked, “The inclusion of our innovative Nu-Med Plus 100 device in this study will further demonstrate how valuable this product is to the nitric oxide research community. We are excited to be working with such an esteemed physician and researcher.”

Inhaled nitric oxide is a medically essential gas that is currently used as a treatment for Neonate Hypoxia therapy (inadequate oxygen level in newborns), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary health issues. Precision doses of nitric oxide may have future applications for treating a variety of other diseases and complications that are currently being investigated. Nu-Med Plus nitric oxide delivery products provide a portable, cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly method of delivering precise therapeutic doses of nitric oxide to patients.

I am a profitable investor and trader of cryptos but due to the current state of the market being how it is (typical cycle with lower volume) I have become interested in penny stocks because I believe that they behave similar to ICO companies/small market cap altcoins and I would like to take advantage of my knowledge in trading and bring it to penny stocks. I’ve been doing some research lately but still trying to figure out how to approach this. Are there any specific stocks screeners you could recommend? What about resources to stay up to date on market news/trends as well as discover new stocks to trade? Forums? Any specific industries that are hot? 

Any and all advice is sincerely appreciated. Maybe if you know a bit and offer me some tips and guidance I could do the same if you’ve ever been interested in trading/investing in cryptos. Just putting that out there. Thanks.

LAS VEGAS, NV, Sept. 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCQB:ISBG) (“ISBG” or the “Company”), a top-tier brand incubator in the Global Wine &amp; Spirits market, is excited to announce that it has signed a letter of intent (“LOI”) with Canbiola, Inc. (OTCMKTS: CANB) (“Canbiola”), a U.S. Company specializing in the sale of premium CBD-based products, for CANB to provide hemp extracted CBD for inclusion in our new line of CBD-infused alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as CBD Chews, for sale in North America.  


In line with a wave of recent strategic investments, the Company is convinced that the CBD-infused beverage market represents an enormous opportunity within the CBD and craft spirits twin booms.

“This has become the hottest new thing in terms of strategic investments,” commented ISBG CEO, Terry Williams. “Everyone is starting to see the same thing right now, and we deeply believe that a relationship between ISBG and Canbiola will allow us to set ourselves apart from our competitors.”

The LOI contemplates a process during which the two companies will hash out the precise details of a definitive agreement, whereby ISBG will draw upon its vast stores of knowledge and experience when it comes to taking a variety of ingredients and suppliers and producing a high-quality bottled beverage of complex composition with a branding advantage, and Canbiola will provide CBD in a form and through a process that integrates into that picture effectively.

Marco Alfonsi, Canbiola CEO, added, “The market for CBD and CBD related products is growing at an exceptional rate, fueled by consumers’ increasing awareness of the effects and benefits of CBD. Canbiola manufactures what I believe to be the finest proprietary CBD products on the market today, and I expect that quality to cross over to this new line of products. I look forward to this relationship and its vast potential.”

Additional details on the definitive agreement – once it is negotiated and entered between the parties – will follow.
