Look for companies like apple, walmart, kroger, bank of america, coca cola, pepsi , jp morgan there are many more . These companies are established pays dividends which you can reinvest. Not to mention most of these companies have strong balance sheets. Means they can last longer in a economic downturn. Diversity is the key. Don’t put all your money on same thing.

This med uses bacteria to deliver ""protective secretions"" that our mucosal cells secrete when they're...well...alive. That is a real mechanism of treatment, not just a band-aid to make it hurt worse. That's big.

- they told everyone: anyone who holds trnx from Sept 13th- sept 30th will get 3:1 of the spinoff stock for every 1 of the main stock.

Few questions:

* What is the website you posted in the screenshot?
* Is that real analysis or just machine-generated analysis?

The last articles dedicated to NTWK on seekingalpha were few years ago, what is IMHO outdated.

""Valaris plc's Caa3 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) reflects its very high debt burden and untenable capital structure; significant ongoing negative cash flow generation that will further deplete its liquidity cushion, and the high likelihood of a potential near-term debt restructuring. The CFR also considers the low commodity price environment, weak fundamentals of the deepwater drilling markets and the high re-contracting risk Valaris faces beyond 2020.

Valaris' key strengths include its large and high-quality rig fleet, excellent diversification across geography, rig types, and customers, and some contracted backlog, which stood at $2.45 billion as of December 31, 2019.""",2020-04-13

The drama came from the fact that one of the majority holders offered a .25 cent non binding agreement which has since expired since they didn’t take it. So that really drove the price down and scared some people. 

Yet their assets far out weigh any debt they currently have so a lot of people are still expecting there to be a 1.00 buyout based on talk about assets minus debt. 

I think this is very realistic based off my own DD and personal beliefs. I currently hold several thousand shares because even if it only sells for .50 cent a share based off my entry point. I will have still made some decent money.",2020-04-13

P3 is a really long haul if they don't get a *breakthrough drug* designation or licensing deals. It will take years of spending with no income and right now no one is even starting trials because of COVID-19 risks.

If it runs to $1.48+ on anticipation or results, I'm pulling my initial investment plus 50% profit. I will hold the rest to see if they get licensing agreements because I think it's very likely. I will probably exit on licensing and reassess their future and timeline. I don't think I will be holding, or at least not a lot of shares, through P3.

In the past KULR Technology reported that it's TRS battery storage application is being tested and developed for a tier-1 medical device manufacturer and automaker (electric vehicles).  I imagine that the product development period for potential inclusion of TRS technology into electric vehicles, medical devices, and electronics in general is a rather lengthy process in comparison to the recently announced ""battery bag"" application for the shipping and logistics industry.

### HealthSpace receives bid award from Colorado

2020-02-04 06:19 PT - News Release

Mr. Silas Garrison reports

HEALTHSPACE ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL BID FOR THE STATE OF COLORADO

HealthSpace Data Systems Ltd. has received the bid award with Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment. Once the contract is finalized, the multiyear deal will be worth in excess of $700,000 (U.S.) for the company.

This deal comes on the heels of several sales the company has closed in Colorado. It positions the company's HSCloud Suite to be the premier cloud platform across the state and opens the doors to local agencies in the state who will first look to HealthSpace when considering their own solutions. This provides the company numerous opportunities for revenue expansion within Colorado in the future.

HealthSpace chief executive officer Silas Garrison noted: ""I am very pleased that we were selected as the winning bid with Colorado. We continue to expand our geographical footprint, which gives us leverage and opportunity across a wide array of agencies. This is the kind of momentum that will help drive sales growth on an exponential basis both in 2020 and in years to come.""

HealthSpace Data Systems Ltd.

HealthSpace is an industry-leading technology company currently providing inspection, information, communication and data management systems for federal, state, county and municipal governments.",2020-04-13

I would be looking to sell the put quickly ans before expiration, as much of the research i have conducted says the Theta/money lost over time accumulates and such. 

Additionally, what is considered a high Vega? It seems like many of the contracts are like .0008-.0017 the higher ITM you go.

### HealthSpace signs $1.69M (U.S.) deal with San Francisco

2020-01-21 06:53 PT - News Release

Mr. Silas Garrison reports

HEALTHSPACE SIGNS $1.69 MILLION USD CONTRACT WITH THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

HealthSpace Data Systems Ltd. has closed its contract with the San Francisco Department of Environmental Health. This represents the company's first deal within California and is the largest single municipality contract the company has ever sold. The total worth of the contract is $1,698,003 (U.S.) over the next five years.

San Francisco is a significant deal as it allows the company to significantly extend its sales pipeline within California. San Francisco is situated in one of the most heavily populated and tech-centric regions of the country. However, as is often the case in government, these agencies are the last to see the benefit of advanced technology. The company's cloud platform, HSCloud Suite, makes the best of modern day tech easily accessible for government agencies of all sizes.

HealthSpace chief executive officer Silas Garrison commented: ""We become increasingly excited at every chance we get to help government agencies operate more efficiently. Being able to do so within the heart of Silicon Valley only amplifies that excitement. As we begin working with the city of San Francisco, other cities across the state will take notice. There is an immense opportunity to capitalize on the surrounding cities and aggressively sell into other areas of California, not just geographically, but also additional government agencies beyond environmental health.""",2020-04-13

For instance GME 4/17 $5p has IV of 240%. I don’t care what Vega is .0008 or .0017, 240% is insane. Since the market as a whole is volatile (VXX or VIXY) options are already inflated and time decay via IV will literally steal your money. GME at 240% with Vega .002 means that if the price stabilizes, say IV from 240 to 230 you’ll lose $0.02 off your option (opposite is also true). Theta is at 0.06 so you lose that right off the bat. Delta is 0.53


Okay so stock is at $4.86, GME 4/17 $5p is at bid 0.45 ask 0.80 mark 0.63. If you buy 1 of these tomorrow (assuming everything is exactly how it is now (it won’t be)). Let’s say you get it for the bid tomorrow and the price doesn’t change tomorrow, the option lost .06 overnight, volatility drops to something like 200 so -.08. Now the price for that option is 0.31.


Let’s say you pick it up for .45 and the price drops from 4.86 to 4.36 (-10.2%), delta says the put should increase by $.26, with the other Greeks (-.14) its now at 0.57. Likely range will be bid 0.35-0.79.


I guess my point is you need to assess the risk you’re willing to take and to run the numbers to make an educated decision. I’d rather read in the future “I ran the numbers and had a good strategy going in and got screwed” than “I threw some crows feet on the ground and it spelled p8g so I bought 25$p on UBER and lost everything”.",2020-04-13

Stage: Phase 2 clinical trial

Name: leronlimab

Background: CytoDyn, a preclinical biotechnology company based in Vancouver, said March 31 that the FDA is allowing a mid-stage trial for its experimental drug leronlimab in COVID-19 patients to move forward. The investigational therapy has not been approved for any indications; for COVID-19, it’s being proposed as a treatment for mild-to-moderate respiratory complications that occur in patients with the disease. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will test the efficacy and safety of leronlimab in 75 patients. CytoDyn had been studying the experimental therapy as a treatment for people with HIV and a form of metastatic breast cancer.

We haven’t even retraced to the .97 we hit the morning (PM) of the beginning of the market meltdown. The market has kept this stock down when it should be running. Good results are, in my opinion, absolutely not priced in at all.

The value of the drug with good results speaks for itself. It’s a home use prevention and cure for an expensive, painful, and harmful disease in a wide open worldwide market.

If these were normal times, $3-$5 would be an absolute lock in my mind. It ran to $3.70 on P1 results alone.

Even if I temper my expectations a LOT, I just can’t see it being under $1.50 again in general moving forward, with good results, even if the market is bad. It just wouldn’t make any mathematical sense.

$2+ is a very conservative expectation. $3+ should be reasonably expected with any single licensing deal in hand and several are possible within the next few months. No buyout could possibly reasonably happen under $3.50 and that would be selling out.

### Public Health Contact Tracing

📷Okanogan County Public Health has partnered with an existing vendor – HealthSpace USA – to implement a secure electronic contact tracing tool. They expect to go live with system on Monday April 20, 2020. The system allows public health to enter data of all COVID-19 cases, exposures, and possible exposures, and send those citizens a secure survey daily by text and/or email to monitor any symptoms, provide testing information if needed, and help support our community — to flatten the curve — through this difficult time.

Healthcare providers will also be able to report cases directly to Public Health through the system, allowing Public Health to do more thorough contact tracing.

Contact tracing, along with rapid and abundant testing, is essential to bring this pandemic under control, and help to restore and reopen our communities, and country. We appreciate the cooperation of our citizens and communities in this effort.

## HAWAI‘I DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH USES NEW DIGITAL TOOL TO ENHANCE CONTACT TRACING AND MONITORING CAPACITY

Posted on Apr 29, 2020 in [Newsroom](https://health.hawaii.gov/news/category/newsroom/)

HONOLULU – The Hawai‘i Department of Health (DOH) is using a new digital tool to follow up with individuals who have had close contact with a person identified by DOH as having COVID-19. The tool will improve the efficiency of data collection by public health staff.

HealthSpace Data Systems Ltd. (HS:CSE; HSDLF:OTCMKTS), a Software as a Service (SaaS) company that works with more than 500 government agencies across North America, has extended its HSCloud Suite and My Health Department products to enable contact tracing for COVID-19. The state of Hawaii, the Okanogan County Public Health in Washington and Vancouver Island Health Authority are among the initial users of the platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year, the firm closed a contract with the City of San Francisco. ""That is a really big win for us in multiple ways. Not only is that the heart of Silicon Valley, and really opens up the door to a lot of recognition, but it also gives us new ground to begin selling in California. It's our first customer in California, so we've opened up a new sales territory, and there are numerous cities within the Bay Area that are now looking at our solution,"" Garrison said.

&amp;#x200B;

The firm is increasing its offerings and revenue sources by teaming up with PayPal to develop HSPay, a payment platform for its customers. ""HSPay is essentially a fintech solution rolled up within our cloud platform,"" Garrison explained. ""Our existing customers are currently collecting over $300 million a year in revenue from private businesses in order for them to operate. The majority of that money comes through paper means: check or cash. That is so cumbersome in this modern age, not only does the fee reconciliation process for the government agency necessitate bank deposits, but it's also burdensome on the private industry having to cut a paper check in an age where they'd much prefer online and mobile payments.""

&amp;#x200B;

HealthSpace will be the merchant of record and offer the value added service to its government agency customers. ""The government gets its money faster and it is saved a lot of headaches, but also private businesses are actually now incentivized and less taxed in terms of time and effort because they don't have to worry about keeping track of which invoice is paid. It's all stored in one central online solution. And our agreement with PayPal allows us to have a portion of the fees, adding a new revenue stream,"" Garrison said.

Research report from Stonegate Capital detailing the current business (not 5 years ago as is being referenced here in some links)...notice the valuation (not a price target, a valuation of what the company is worth on paper)

• Valuation – Based on our DCF of TRNF, we arrive at a **valuation range of $0.28 to $0.47**, with a **midpoint of $0.36**.

So at a minimum, a valuation that would be 2.33x higher than the current price of $0.12. This might a long term deal, but it looks promising to me (2750 shares @ $0.1357)",2020-04-13
