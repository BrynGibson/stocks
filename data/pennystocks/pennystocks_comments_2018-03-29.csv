The same rationale is applied to limiting investors' access to hedge funds or investment strategies that are based on performance rather than flat fee structures as, ""qualified"" or ""sophisticated,"" which is determined by account balance.

I think the other rationale is probably that brokerages use the ACH(?) system of clearing trades so the trades occur on the day of the trade plus 3 days, requiring people to use margin or cash provides some recourse so that trades aren't effected without having sufficient funds on the other end....I believe there is a push at the banking level to update this system, since other countries have already gotten away from it.

After losing my ass early on sub penny pumps, I started to invest in better stocks NVDA, CONN, EXEL,  AMD back when, and scan every morning, because Ameritrade/think or swim has a great set of tools. I kept a small portion for chasing junk stock opportunities, because it's fun.

Having said that, I now have Ameritrade, Robinhood and ustocktrade accounts for different reasons. I actually find I do worse with Robinhood and ustocktrade than I ever did with my Ameritrade acct. I guess no fees and 1 Dollar trades make me gamble a lot more than actually thinking a trade through. Both Robinhood and ustocktrade are small accts though. Btw, ustocktrade goes around the PDT rule.

Hang in there and get away from shit stocks.",2018-03-29

I disagree with you though, cash isn't on margin, that's outdated shit. No broker has to wait 3 or 5 days for money to clear. We live in an age of instant transactions. If I swipe a card I get a text 30 seconds later saying that money is gone. The entire 3 to 5 days to clear is modern day bullshit to keep broke people from trading with the wealthy. However, I do believe a 2 million clueless people with 100 to 1k accts being able to trade all day would possibly wreck the market.... Alot. So again, 15k to daytrade is fair, imo",2018-03-29
