March 6, 2020 9:17 AM 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals (OTCQB: IPIX) continues to receive inquiries regarding the potential of Brilacidin, the Company‚Äôs novel defensin mimetic compound, to treat COVID-19, more generically called ‚Äúcoronavirus,‚Äù given the urgent worldwide need to discover treatments and vaccines for the deadly epidemic. According to Worldometer.info as of Friday morning, more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed worldwide with over 3,400 deaths attributed to the virus.


In the U.S., patients in 18 states have tested positive, or are presumptively positive, for COVID-19. On Thursday, Congress passed an $8.3 billion emergency bill to release funds for fighting COVID-19. Innovation Pharmaceuticals has submitted a preliminary summary of Brilacidin‚Äôs therapeutic potential as a novel coronavirus treatment to the U.S. Government‚Äôs Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and is already collaborating with scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for review of Brilacidin as a potential COVID-19 intervention.

Innovation disclosed last week that the Company signed a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) to provide Brilacidin to one of the U.S.‚Äôs 12 Regional Biocontainment Labs (RBLs) for evaluation against COVID-19.

Today, the Company announces that a second MTA has been signed to ship Brilacidin to a major U.S. university for analysis. One of world‚Äôs leading coronavirus experts is overseeing the research. Innovation management is awaiting approval from the university to disclose additional details on the agreement and hopes to further inform shareholders next week regarding this development.",2020-03-06

You‚Äôre investing your own equity in a company in the hopes of a return....but this is honestly how you find stocks and get in before it takes of:

Run a scan for stocks primed for a breakout (I can‚Äôt remember all the filters off the top of my head, but things like crazy high volume and gradual positive momentum, insider trading) and then literally google all the stocks that come up and look for news that could Act as a catalyst. That‚Äôs the only way to find it before it spikes, and there always the possibility that it won‚Äôt...and it‚Äôs a penny stock, so it probably won‚Äôt.

For example, [Amarillo (AGCBF)](https://www.amarillogold.com/) has a market cap of 38.3 million, EPS -0.02, 145m floating shares. They own 100% of a mine that holds over 1 million ounces and they are pumping out \~2,500oz/week. That's 25x the amount. Proven reserves. Their financials look much better than MXSG too. They're trading at 15 cents.

Osprey Gold (OSPF) has market cap of 4.2 million, EPS -0.01, 55m floating shares. They own multiple gold (and diamond) mines. Their Moose River Consolidated project is expected to produce \~1,700oz/week. That's just one of their active mines. Once again, their financials look much better than MXSG too. They're trading at 5 cents.

Where did you find they have a 900% increase of cash? I've checked a few sources and I don't see that anywhere (e.g. [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MXSG/cash-flow?p=MXSG)). My bank reports their ending net cash balance in March 2019 was $12,000. That's the most recently available annual report.

Most small gold producers do not offer a dividend. And do you really want a small company like this offering a dividend instead of reinvesting it?

They will probably partner with a larger company with good results. The CEO has mentioned this several times. That partnership, in only the US, is expected to come in around $200M-$250M a year. If that happens, the cash value alone makes this a $3-$5 stock.

723,snowslanga,fky6isp,/r/pennystocks/comments/fe991t/simple_questions_march_06_2020/fky6isp/,1,Probably a dumb question to anyone with experience but the wait time for tda customer service is 2hrs so figured I'll ask here. I applied for the margin account on tda so I could look into options trading and now I have no access to the funds in my accout to buy regular shares. It seems to be saying I can only trade any cash over 2k. Do I need to keep 2k in this account that I cant even touch? If so is there any way to switch back to a normal account?,2020-03-06

They hopefully will play a part in manufacturing, unfortunately that won't be for a while",2020-03-06

I'm keeping a close eye on it. If it dips low enough, I'm definitely gonna buy in with a little bit and let it rot till a vaccine is found.

We just weren't anywhere near a vaccine at the time. And still aren't",2020-03-06

732,Samuro57,g119et2,/r/pennystocks/comments/fejrxv/mxsg_gonna_blow_up/g119et2/,1,"Late to the party, but one thing that perked my interest in MXSG was how well they‚Äôve done during gold bull runs, easily running 20x. They‚Äôve peaked during every bull run since their market inception and one thing I‚Äôve noticed is that the vast majority of miners have predictably poor fundamentals and bad looking balance sheets during high economic times. Even Barrick, a huge name in the sector, has has been negative Billions in net Income within the past 5 years. That said, it‚Äôs also peaked with gold, as has MXSG during 07, 11, 16, and now. AISC seems to be one of the biggest factors for a mining companies cash flow, so considering the small MEXUS operates between 450-600 AISC, it seems like a huge boon with today‚Äôs climbing gold prices Knocking on $2500 door, even at ~100oz a week. It‚Äôs also marched from these lows to .15-.57 cents intra day in the past, so u/legalbirdlaw Given the low investment I would say it has a decent upside.",2020-03-06
