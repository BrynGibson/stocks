Holding 300K @ .0183.  May buy 200K more if it hits .01 and then sit on it for at least a year.  But my concern is the reverse triple merger and relying on them to convert GOHE shares 1 to 1 into the new company.  But the technology has potential as long as it's adopted at the consumer level.  Then more retailers jump on board.  Then maybe it becomes an alternative to Venmo or ApplePay, but that's probably years away.

I initially asked them about revenue streams and the patent pending they have displayed on their iPhone app.  Here's that response:

My name is XXXXXXX and I'm a retail share holder of $GOHE.  I am excited to learn more about M-Trac's entrance into this space of the market and have a question regarding the announcement of your first partnership.  I understand that this is a big first step and likely still too early to impact $GOHE's market cap - but as you seek to expand this payment platform to new customers, what will be the main components driving revenue for MTrac?  **The main component to drive revenue would be the MTrac  payment platform, our goal is to integrate our system in high risk industries and beyond, we are not limited to cannabis, as you know with your background  big retail entities can also use our technology because of the benefits  regarding audit and payroll, our system provides a ledger of every transaction and when you become a member of our ecosystem the money transferred settles immediately in real time . The goal is for the consumers to adopt the system and for the merchant to accept it, once that happens we can potentially eliminate the 3rd party which is the bank.** Product license contracts? **yes**  Transaction fees? **yes**

Also, I saw there was a patent pending on one of the screens in the iPhone app.  Can you elaborate any further on this? **Our technology is patented I will reach out to the Principles of the company and inquire if there are any patents pending.**  Will this be a patent owned by MTrac? **Again, I would have to reach out out to the Principles of the company, and get back to you.**

And now the last email I've sent, this morning actually:

 Thanks for the info!  I'd like to follow up with a few more questions as it pertains to the reverse triangular merger.  Prior to the merger announcement, Global Payout Inc stated numerous times that they were pursuing an audit to become a fully reporting company.  Once this merger is completed, will there still be a need to conduct this audit?  If so, will that be pursued more aggressively with a timeline in place to complete?  Or once the merger is completed, will the resulting company be fully compliant and reporting on a quarterly basis there after?  Also, I'd still like to know more about the patent inquiries I made.  Have the principles of the company provided you with any info?

Waiting to hear back on that and then will get into the operations questions.",2018-07-10

* I bought How To Make Millions. $300. Learned a lot, even though I don't think I have mastered that material. Last August I started with $500, I cashed out in December for $3500, so I did okay. I got out of pennystocks for my own reasons. But How To Make Millions made me realize there's something to watching patterns and making educated guesses about where the market was headed. 
* Pennystocking Silver - the chatroom is horrible. It's.. cultlike. The Tim worship is unreal. When people are saying things like ""Yes, master!"" to his suggestions, etc, I start to get creeped out.The video library, however... He posts a lot of this stuff on youtube for free, so be aware that with patterns, everything echoes. Once you learn to recognize certain patterns (pumps, and the following dump), it's all more of the same after that. Just be aware.

I don't think PS is particularly worth your time, especially while just beginning. I would recommend HTMM and follow his profit.ly/twitter trades and try to understand what and why he did what he did. Go through his youtube videos, skip the marketing and focus on the material.

Tim started pushing a ticker labeled BCHS. Otherwise known as Amalgamated Gold and Silver Inc. Funny thing about BCHS is that they hadn't filed a single SEC filing since 2006. Weird huh? Well it grew from .2 to $2.40. A lot of it with Tims pumping. I was there at the time.

In March of 2015, in one day the company fell 73%. At that time taking it down to $0.0037. An hour later, they released their 2014 report.

NO cash or current assets

current liabilities: $2.3 million

NO revenue

net loss: $160 thousand

To my surprise for a company basically still in start up mode.  The guy I've been communicating with requested to speak to me over a phone call which I was able to coordinate approx. an hr after his reply in which he called me once he was done with a conference call he was in.  I spoke with him for about 15 minutes in which he seemed happy to speak to me and did not come off as wasting his time with me.  

He was limited in the info he could provide me as he could only share what was already available in the public domain but did express to me the company is actively pursuing becoming fully reporting and mentioned the goal of getting off the pinks and getting listed on the QB.  But no timelines were given here as he said they still are working on clearing up things with the merger and getting things in order from the previous leadership that recently left the company.  The patent info he still wasn't sure about and said he is still going to follow up with me on that.

I did also ask for some details on the relationship they have with GreenBox but again, he had to refrain from disclosing specifics of the agreement as it pertains to revenue generated from the blockchain technology and devices they provide in this partnership.  I guess we're gonna have to wait and see if/when they start filing 8k's and 10q's to see any details, but he expressed that their relationship is strong and emphasized MTrac's Sales/Marketing exclusivity deal they have with them in CAN/US/MEX but this is info that's already been released to the public.

All in all, I left the phone call with increased confidence in their ability to execute which I definitely didn't have with the previous leadership.  But I'm still going to hold off on increasing my position any further until more concrete news is released.  The stock is still trending down and I'm going to wait to average down at the right time.
