0,WTRH - Waitr Holdings,e381f6,firenance,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e381f6/wtrh_waitr_holdings/,1,10,"Food delivery. I haven’t seen any other discussions on here so wanted to gauge if anyone else follows them. 

Initial IPO close to $10ish, record was $15. This company was growing like crazy under private ownership. Being acquired and going public was when s*** hit the fan. It was then announced they were restructuring their revenue stream AFTER shares started trading. Restaurants started dropping off, they laid off a huge round of long tenured employees.

CEO stepped down and now they are facing a class action for securities fraud accusing them of hiding financial performance issues until after shares were on the market. 

Right now it’s floating around .38 ish a share. My thoughts are they either go bankrupt and close doors, or they get through the class action and take off again. I’m from Louisiana and people love the company, it’s amazing how many food deliveries they process on a daily basis. So I was able to get some $2.50 LEAPS for cheap.

Anyone else following this company? Or try to day trade the swings?",2019-11-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e381f6/wtrh_waitr_holdings/

5,I bought CA:ACU instead of ACB – is this worth something?,e3efdk,maggiathor,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e3efdk/i_bought_caacu_instead_of_acb_is_this_worth/,1,14,"Long story short, there was alcohol involved thought I should buy weed stocks (stupid idea anyways) ... so I typed Aurora into my phone.   
No I'm sitting on a lot of  these stocks worth 6 cents a piece.  

This company builds quality measurement systems for the solar industry ... not weed ...

Low and behold, I did  little research ...

Since I bought they basically got into the China Market and published some sales success and realesed their Q2 Report yesterday: [http://aurorasolartech.com/content/uploads/2019/11/Q2\_MDA\_20190930.pdf](http://aurorasolartech.com/content/uploads/2019/11/Q2_MDA_20190930.pdf)

I know that liquidity is probably a huge liability here, but I'd really like to know if this company is actually worth something or close to bankruptcy.

OTC is back!",e3fz2r,Hellcat_v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e3fz2r/sbes_stsn_could_be_the_biggest_runners_for/,1,0,"Its been a few DREARY months in the OTC. Nice to see some fresh companies/mergers. 

How can $STSN have such a small float? - It only has a 1.5 million float.  I am just waiting till they put out their first press release. Went Pink current this week. Seems like a big company, if you look at the 12+ filings they submitted in the last 3 weeks.

Think I am gonna wait till their first press release. Crazy spread right now lol.

Any thoughts on why this is happening?

Any idea what a good entry price would be after this spinoff date?

Also since they are essentially splitting up TRNX into its fuel division, is the price of TRNX going to take a hit on its market capitalization since it will be creating new stocks for its fuel division?!",2019-11-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e3ixdn/trnx_spinoff_date_today_price_is_dropping/
