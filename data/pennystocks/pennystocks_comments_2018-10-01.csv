&gt;For the first 6 months of 2018 the stock barely traded and at a relatively higher price but towards the end of July of 2018 you could have purchased stock just below a penny, somewhere around $0.007. Many people I am sure did not, I am sure many people did not even know the company existed. (Unqualified management). A few days after they announced a deal with Walmart to sell their products and the stock went crazy. From $0.01’s to $0.15 making a modest 1,500% Gain.

This is a extreme outlier event given that they announced a deal with one of the biggest companies in the world to sell a product. The things you saw in INND that you are seeing in IBGR are given in the points from 1-5. I am wondering when specifically in the past half year did it happen for INND as I want to analyze the price action leading up to the Walmart deal. If the price action stayed flat through all of that, then there is no reason to believe there is a correlation between these points and what potential the stock has. For all we know, IBGR could fit the criteria from points 1-5 but it does not translate to gains. INND could just so happen to have an outlier event with Walmart. What about points 1-5 give it a positive correlation so that the stock has 5-10x potential?

&gt; It has recently gained about 50% from $0.005 to $0.007 in the past week of trading. (Someone knows something!) There is a Stop sign up on OTC Markets but with this recent corporate action the most plausible next action would be to update the shareholders and that could be the take off point. Do your DD and be smart!

Penny stocks are incredibly illiquid especially, sub penny stocks. Given that you have good amount of cash, you can manipulate the price of sub penny stocks easily. The price movement really doesn't say a whole lot. The volume today was roughly 2 million @ say 0.007, that puts only a value of 14k changing hands. That is a really small amount needed to manipulate a stock. 

So there was a stop sign up on OTC markets, how would this compare to IBGR when they had their OTC market Stop sign? Could you point me to when that happened because I would be really intrigued to compare the two much more closely as you made the direct comparison to them with that example. The points you gave are very interesting but there are very few factual details. It was more like, here are some points, now take it at face value from what I say.",2018-10-01

Infection control/prevention is a HUUUUUUUUGE concern in the medical field and the 97% efficacy rate they demonstrated in their clinical trials makes this a very interesting company. Neutrolin is already used in the EU.

Unfortunately I only bought 1000 shares at $0.62 and it's currently at $2.26. Thought about more but this was the first stock I ever purchased.

Initial target price based on everything I've read was $3 but I think it will go much higher depending on when they get FDA approval considering they're already over $2 without any real new news.",2018-10-01

Your post indicated that you looked at a price chart, saw that at one point it was $9.00. Then, with no good reason at all, and no indication that you had a clue about what that business does, you decided that somehow it would get back up there. 

You never posted anything about what drugs they were trying to get pushed through the FDA, efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the drugs, you never added your thoughts about likelihood of success, Market/patient size. You had nothing but a price chart.

The company did not go back to $9.00 because it was at $9.00 at one time
and just had to be worth that again for no good reason.It went to $9.00 because it had some major successes with its drugs , clinical trials, and business decisions. You predicted none of these.

Great job, I’m glad you made good cash. I would advise that if you don’t want to lose it, the next investment you make will be based on an understanding of the underlying business rather than lines on a chart.
