This is very solid news for MGON that justifies a value of .078 per share based on EBITDA as explained below:    
 Quote:   
 

[https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=78592380](https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=78592380)   
  Houston, Texas, Nov. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Publicly-held Megola,  Inc. (OTC Pink: MGON) is pleased to announce current status of revenues  and future direction of sales distributions into the United States and  Canadian CBD (Cannabidiol) markets. Acordy President Francisco Baez  states: ‚ÄúFor 2018, the Company is rapidly approaching 2 million euros  ($2.4 million US Dollars) in revenues. This reflects an increase of over  300% compared with the same nine month period of 2017. Pretax profits  for the nine months ending 9-30-2018 came in at ‚Ç¨490,524 (approximately  USD$ 585,000) representing nearly a 200 % increase over 2017. With  Megola introducing CBD products and CBD infused olive oil into the U.S.  and Canada, we are poised for substantial growth in 2019‚Äù.    
 

Below is a Gross Valuation Based on EBITDA:    
 

Gross Income √∑ Outstanding Shares (OS) = Earnings Per Share (EPS)    
 EPS x Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio = MGON Share Price Valuation    
 

$585,000 per 9 months = $65,000 Per Month Per Year    
 $65,000 x 12 = $780,000 Gross Profit Per Year    
 

$780,000 √∑ 196,095,060 Shares (MGON OS) = .0039 EPS    
 

.0039 EPS x 20 PE Ratio = .078 MGON Share Price Valuation EBITDA    
 

 I used 20 as what I believe is a fair and conservative Price to  Earnings (PE) Ratio as the growth rate for the Marijuana Industry.    
 

 Also, this does not take into account any future growth that is planned  by the company which leads me to believe that MGON is significantly  undervalued.",2019-05-03
