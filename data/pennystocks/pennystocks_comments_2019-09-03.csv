2,born2rock4life,eyvasmc,/r/pennystocks/comments/cyzadz/hsgx_reverse_merger/eyvasmc/,1,"Two big moves have happened already. The last ride up and potential big move will be between now and right up until the vote for the merger completes, sept 12th. I previously covered HSGX’s merger with Ocugen, but have since moved on to others and leaning towards SPY options.

If you decide to ride it out, please be aware it is a high risk / high reward scenario. The merger could fall through, and that would send the share price violently downward if for some reason it doesn’t pass. If you do decide to take the risk, I see dilution being a concern once the merger is finalized. That said, I personally would not hold once merger is approved due to this, but would consider riding the wave up. But please do your own due diligence, as you must decide this for yourself.

Best of luck in your trading.",2019-09-03

I think this is a great company to invest with given it's position of the biggest mining producer of cobalt in the world and it's recent deal with FCC; but I found skepticism with the lawsuits it's facing for it's royalties deal with a sanctioned billionaire.

The good: Cobalt prices have looked like it has found it's bottom and IMO, recovered this year.  It shut down one of the biggest cobalt mining projects called Mutanda that produced 27k tonnes out of the 137k tonnes produced IN THE WORLD last year to save money and raise cobalt prices. Management also plans on $2 billion in stock buyback in response to falling stock prices. 

The bad: The FCC cobalt mining facility won't be finished to produce cobalt until late 2020 or 2021. There's an oversupply of cobalt in the world, leading the company to suspend the Mutanda project. Lawsuits from shareholders from it's shady business of paying off a US sanctioned Israeli in royalties by paying in Euros. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this stock will be on my watchlist. If the stock doesn't break the $5 till earnings, it looks as if it might be in a reversal on the charts. Hopefully it doesn't see any lawsuits in the future as that would be detrimental to the price. I also noticed that cobalt prices inflated during 2008 recession and in 2016-2018 from oversupply. Compared to the markets in general, this looks like an oversold stock with potential during a recession. It's also very attractive to institutional investors with it's 5% yield and holding as a commodity &amp; mining stock (world's largest for $5 a share).
