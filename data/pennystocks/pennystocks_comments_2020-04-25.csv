Honestly there's a lot of things that could be in play but you know when big money is on the line people do crazy things. It's very possible big pharma is trying to put down DECN. Maybe they have a test they think they can get out while it's suspended and get the contracts this company was due for because they were ahead of them due to already having the idea behind it from the diabetic tests 
I think they will ultimately prove that these are false claims but the damage may be done already and maybe people in the know and the big money and influences already know it.

The specified stock has been less important in my case than the strategy. Where I've been successful is taking small gains, and having multiple positions in stocks that have enough volatility to give me an increased chance at getting a small profit when my position is near a recent low. If i miss a dip, then lower my overall cost when the chance presents. I don't trade off of emotion (super hard  for me). Let me say that I have missed out on big gains due to my strategy of compounded small gains, I recently sold off my energy penny stocks for a small gain and Trump's tweets gave me the only headache after seeing the spike when it was too late(I could have potentially been up over $500, instead $224). My gut told me they would level out soon and so far they have, which leads me to an important point; Penny stocks are unlikely to maintain a big spike in price, unless backed by bug national news specific to that stock. Penny stocks are not blue chip companies and can be subject to bankruptcy, pump and dump scams, etc. Make sure that your stocks aren't gonna be reverse split any time soon, there isn't any talk of bankruptcy ( if there is, take your losses and sell), any open etf/etn poitions aren't scheduled for liquidation.

FYI

On March 10, 2020, Aytu reported that it reached a license agreement for the exclusive distribution of a point-of-care rapid test for certain COVID-19 antibodies in the U.S. for three years, with three year auto-renewals moving forward.


Then, on April 17, 2020, pre-market, NBC News issued a report entitled ""Unapproved Chinese coronavirus antibody tests being used in at least 2 states."" Citing health officials and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") filings, the article stated that the Company has been distributing unreliable COVID-19 tests from unapproved Chinese manufacturers, which were shipped to the U.S. after the FDA relaxed its guidelines for tests in mid-March.

1.) The guys does his own PR, doesn't have a ton of employees, looks like he is the kind of guy that tackles everything that he can himself to save money/prove that he is capable. I do not think any errors in type or there is any intentional mistakes etc in his PRs at all. I think he is a busy guy with tons of work to do to make this happen.

2.) If his plan was to buy up millions of shares at one cent why wouldn't he just have done that before his march 3rd press release when I believe he started the whole news of the company developing for covid testing. He could then have sold these after the stock had been going up then dumped them all like you were suggesting at 48 cents.

3.) The insert about the accuracy of the tests etc.. I do not know enough about this, can you verify the tests you are talking about his buying out in S Korea use the same electronmicroscopy technology and are the same or similar in design?

&amp;#x200B;

If this is somehow some sort of intentional confusing fraud I think the key would lay in the FDA PRE EUA paperwork package that he submitted to the FDA for processing. We have no ability to see this. I do not know what the requirements are to from but what would stop someone from just compiling everything out of thin air so long as all the forms are included, fake information filled in to all the necessary forms etc.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again I do not believe this is the case and I do not believe it is fraud.. keep thinking though, I can't figure out what the hell is going on either.",2020-04-25

Earlier this month they announced that GUSH was going through a 40 to 1 reverse split, which took effect March 24th. A reverse split is a measure companies take to drive up their share price where shares are combined together. A 40 to 1 reverse split means that every 40 shares of GUSH were combined into 1 and their price per share increased by a factor of 40. For instance, if you had 800 shares worth $0.75 each on March 22 then on March 23 those became 20 shares worth $30 each. The total value is the same but the cost went up by 40 times and the number of shares were reduced to 1/40th. That’s reflected in all of the graphs you’re seeing. A reverse split is usually not a good thing because it shows the company is in financial distress and has no other option. A year ago GUSH wasn’t listed at $4000, it was listed at $100, but there are now 1/40th the amount of shares as there were a year ago. Does that make sense?

The company is speculated to be partnering with Amazon in delivery of their drones. This could be a great stock to play UP TO the news on Thursday. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ageagle-hold-corporate-conference-call-133356851.html

Why do I say up to the news and not through it? Nobody really knows if it will indeed be Amazon. But on speculation alone, this thing could hit up to $1-$2 Wednesday AH or Thursday morning. It also could not, so do your own research and take it with a grain of salt. They may also not be announcing any partnerships with anyone, a partnership announcement has not been confirmed TO MY KNOWLEDGE (if someone does have confirmation please link below I’d love to read about it) 

Also, DECN just this week is a great example of why you should GENERALLY (not always) sell BEFORE THE NEWS. There will always be buying opportunities down the road, but it’s important to lock up your gains beforehand. All of this is my opinion of course. Holding through the news can pay dividends of course as well, but I only do that if I’m absolutely sure, and I’ve still been burned before. Of course I’ve also missed out on plenty of upside because I’ve sold early but hindsight is 20/20. It’s easy to say you should have sold a stock at its peak but nobody ever knows exactly where that peak will be beforehand.  

If Amazon is indeed the partner, this thing could take off, or it could not, who really knows. Right now it’s garnering a lot of interest and new investors because of that. I plan on selling Wednesday night or very early Thursday. I currently have 4500 shares at an average of about $0.62

Now as for analyst price forecasts, I put almost zero faith into what they say. That forecast could be for 5 years into the future and from one I’ve seen only 1 analyst at the Wall Street Journal has indicated that as his target price. I’m not putting all my faith into one guy, EVER. Analysts have been way way way off in the past many times. I’ve linked below to an article showing then being hilariously off in the past.

I would suggest paper trading for a while until you learn more with a software like think or swim.

Once you feel comfortable you can put your money into a brokerage like td ameritrade or Schwab and start trading for real
As for finding penny stocks to trade I use scanners as well as checking the news daily. You can also use this subreddit or stocktwits/ twitter but take what you find from here with a grain of salt because you can never trust anyone but yourself and your own research.

I know a lot of people trade on platforms like Robinhood that do not charge any fees per transaction (I sadly do not). However, if you and you’re new to trading and are charged brokerage fees please read this.

Let’s say you’re so John Doe and you want to buy 100 shares of a stock at $0.50 but your broker charges $5 fees per transaction. You’re really spending $55 to buy the stock instead of $50. Then when you sell there’s an additional $5 fee. So in total you’re really spending $60 to buy that stock. You’re average share price in terms of book cost is actually $0.60 because of those two fees, meaning your break even price to get out with absolutely not gained or lost is $0.60. The stock just went up 20% but you gained absolutely nothing. In this case you need the stock to rise 30% in order to even make 5 dollars.

So how do you increase your odds of making money:

If you do have enough money in your account (hopefully spread out over a bunch of different assets) you might want to place more money on that stock. So instead of only buying $50 worth of shares  you could try $250 giving you a breakeven share price after fees of $0.54, only an 8% gain. Now if that stock gains 20% you sell for a nice $40 profit after accounting for brokerage fees.

If you don’t have those funds  available, it may not be worth it investing in short term gains from penny stocks. Use your best judgement and if you have those brokerage fees like me, calculate your breakeven point and make sure it’s worth the risk.

No. They aren't. Antibodies or not it's still a 5% mortality rate.

&gt;So yes people will still die, people die of the flu every year and yet we don't quarantine the nation. 

Because the flu only has a 2% mortality rate and is fairly treatable. The infection and mortality rate of Covid were/are much higher. Which makes it more deadly.

Trading with $100 can work but it basically forces you to put all your eggs in one basket because of it. 

I can share the best advice that I was given early on by a family friend. He told me to take $20 every paycheque if you can and put it into my account. I’m Canadian so we have something called a Tax Free Savings Account where you can contribute a certain amount each year. I have no idea how that works in other countries to be honest but if you have something similar I suggest using it.
 
$20 dollars a paycheque, assuming you get paid biweekly turns in 520 a year, $50 into $1300 etc. From there you have a stable base that you can use to invest in multiple stocks, bonds, funds or whatever you please.

Best of luck along your journey!

The section about setting a profit target is definitely useful — you can’t expect to make off with 50% gains every time. 

In my personal experience though I don’t tend to set any number for profits. I simply buy in when a green candle breaks through the SMA line and establishes upward momentum, and then I ride the price action up and sell out when a red candle breaks through the SMA line. Sometimes it means I make almost no profit and sometimes I can ride it up for 50% profit or more.

However I always set a number for losses. Usually it’s like 5-10% loss before I call it quits. I’ve gotten burned too many times hoping the direction would be reversed where I just have paper hands now when it comes to losses on penny stocks.",2020-04-25

But since you are apparently a medical professional the gravity of my next statement should weigh heavier on you. 

When the nation reopens and there is inevitably a second wave of infections, the full swing of which will be in late summer early fall, the Flu season will be starting up. This first wave already overloaded our hospitals within a matter of weeks by itself. That added load of the flu on top of it will only magnify how bad the first outbreak was.

 With a two week incubation period, asymptomatic carriers and the fact that we don't know if you can get covid a second time PLUS another virus going around at the same time the fifty-four thousand some-odd deaths we've had will be minor comparatively. That footage from New York of bodies being loaded into trailers will be a nationwide reality.

The following is for areas not hit as an epicenter ei NYC, New Orleans etc


 I am not being flippant about this. You want to see freaking scared and nervous? You should have seen us at the beginning of the pandemic and lockdown. Definitely myself as I deal with all the ventilators and was in NJ at the beginning of the outbreak/lockdown being trained on new vents we had just purchased. One of our classmates was removed during this class due to covid 19. 

We have learned how to deal with it and are doing an excellent job dealing with it. As for hospitals being overloaded that was/is being taken COMPLETELY out of context in how it is being reported, except in areas like NYC. The RT Depths were initially overloaded especially with the vent shortage. The vent shortages were in response to what we thought the caseload would be and did not materialize. The rest of the hospitals are empty except for life threatening care. Many hospitals are going broke due to this. 

Again yes there will be a second wave though not like the first especially since we have a far better handle on this. Covid will probably be around for a long time, this does not mean we need to keep the worldwide economies closed. If it was like we initially suspected as being similar to the Spanish Flu I would agree the entire economy should stay closed. But it is not.

Realistically it’s going to take forever to bring this to a test phase. But I guess we’ll all learn more during the Tuesday conference call. 

I fear the SEC could halt it based on the accuracy and adequacy of information available on Healight. Especially since Aytu was HEAVILY promoting it on twitter. 

This is just my opinion though. I actually like the company and thought they were gonna make big bucks on their covid tests but they seem to just be stringing investors along and I’m ready to jump ship. I’ll jump back in once this healight stuff blows over and hope they become more transparent about their current and future sales/sales contracts.",2020-04-25

Yes, there's a lot of complaining or comiserating about losses and a lot of general tomfoolery. I'm a new trader but taking it pretty seriously, trying to learn which indicators to use and things like that. I'm being responsible about money invested and made a few rookie mistakes. I would love for someone to talk about their basic, pre-market or nightly routine they use in identify stocks. I have a decent idea what I'm doing but would love some guidance for myself and other serious investors willing to research, read, and learn. A post in this sub or the other discussion i started would be awesome. Thanks!",2020-04-25
