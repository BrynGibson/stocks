Aside from transaction and reg fees, you would not be too far out. Even to go a little lower if you are only losing 50 bucks, then fine. Bio companies that are still in trial phases are way too risky, especially in cancer since the likelyhood of trial sucess depends on sucess with lab animals then clinical human trials. If the trial participant dies or get hurt badly, that company is basically toast. 

However, if you lose your shirt on this one, at least it went to a good cause.

125,born2rock4life,ejh7nn9,/r/pennystocks/comments/b5wemd/have_you_come_across_ricky_gutierrezs_swingday/ejh7nn9/,1,"I bought his course, and it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre starting from scratch and just trying to learn the fundamental basics. I live nearby Gilbert, and he piqued my interest after watching his YouTube videos and came across genuine and disciplined, which I believe on all accounts he is. He has some solid advice and will work with you to help mentor when you reach out, partake in the Sunday stock talks, etc...

...But;

1). It‚Äôs not geared toward penny stocks, at all. He highly discourages his target audience (beginners,) from trading them.

2). Everything he teaches in the paid course is available in his YouTube videos for free. Sure, it‚Äôs not as easy as taking a course that streamlines and thus fast tracks the process, but anyone who is trying to trade stocks and wants an easy way are those who pay the market for their education and blow up their accounts.

3). He has a niche style of trading which is mainly geared around leveraged ETF‚Äôs for oil, gold, natural gas, and otherwise mostly commodities. The principals for trading such are widely dependent on the underlying futures for the commodity, and don‚Äôt trade like equities would. Again, another reason this isn‚Äôt pertinent to penny stocks.

4). The price of the program is good comparatively to other courses out there, no doubt, but for a beginner just trying to learn the ropes, there are far better free videos on YouTube, as well as books that can be had on Amazon Kindles free month membership which are more geared toward equities and specifically penny stocks. I learned far more from them regarding equities day trading and understanding the market as a whole.

5). He does not teach or promote shorting stocks. With his niche, he does teach how to play the inverse ETF‚Äôs, but that doesn‚Äôt translate to equities in a way most beginners would understand. I‚Äôve come to find that if you‚Äôre doing equities trading, you‚Äôre only shooting yourself in the foot to not play the offense and defense when day trading. Too many people, and beginners especially, think they see a good deal and then end up trying to catch a falling knife. Ricky highly advises against doing that and teaches you to ‚Äúgo with the uptrend,‚Äù but that‚Äôs a missed opportunity when you can short a stock that is breaking its former support.
