3,Traded today for the 1st time in 6 years. 35% gainer!!,dgpn3z,Winnerorloser43,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dgpn3z/traded_today_for_the_1st_time_in_6_years_35_gainer/,11,29,"So about 6 years ago I started trading with 0 clue on what I was doing. I heard of the term pump and dump, thought I could get rich.

Long story short I put $2k into this stock that was a pump and dump. I was actually up $1200 for about an hour. I thought it would keep going up and it tanked.  

Walked away with $800 in my account.

Today I felt motivated, I had a acount with some side money siting there for a few years.


I did very little research, I was looking at charts. I have a few thousand in my account. I only bought $200 worth of  1 stock that lost 6% today and I spent another like $160 on #SES, at 3.28. 

I got out quickly at $4.50

I’m kicking myself to see it got all the wya up to $9.30",2019-10-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dgpn3z/traded_today_for_the_1st_time_in_6_years_35_gainer/
