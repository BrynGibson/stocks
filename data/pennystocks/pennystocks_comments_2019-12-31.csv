INPX, sure. Slippery past, but it takes an adult to step out of the shadows and make a public image to say ""hey, I fucked up people, my fellow shareholders, here's how we are going to fix things"".  An honest CEO with honest intentions is a clean start. 

For INPX's chart point of view, it's an outside bar with open opportunities for changes. I love shit like this, excuse my language. Once the outside bar starts, it continues for potential growth. FCEL, in this example shown here, did the very same thing. Please correct me if I sound like a mad scientist idiot :) [https://ibb.co/G3XvZFM](https://ibb.co/G3XvZFM) 

I know most of you with skepticism will say ""what does this chart differ from the others"" one word... fibonacci. That and using side by side daily chart/intraday chart of the Fibonacci. I see it, I know it, I feel it. If all else fails, then most likely the chart will be complete shit if it falls below 0.07, correct me if I'm wrong. FCEL &amp; INPX share the most essential demand this year and most likely next year's trend, energy &amp; technology. INPX has eyes because well, why not. With all the shootings happening, demand piece of mind, &amp; a feeling of wanting to be safe, the demand and ideas are up in the air.",2019-12-31
