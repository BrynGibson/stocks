It's a 3 wheeled electric car, but for legal purposes its classifed as a motorcycle on the federal level, which means cheaper insurance among other things. $20,000 it's got a range of 102 miles per charge. The 174 MPGe is almost double that of a tesla. Top speed is 75mph so it can go on any highway.

&amp;#x200B;

On gas cars you couldn't really make 3 wheels work that well because you need a large engine, transmission and it just didn't work that well. With EVs the electrical compenents can be shifted around and places almost whereever making the 3 wheeler more promising. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

I found old open source project called FreedomEV, basically it was a group of hobbiest seeking to build a 3 wheel electric cars and help the masses. One person of this project was able to build the frame, brakes, motor, and wheels and sell that completed for $6,000 (just add battery and electric controller) [https://i.imgur.com/rFxV3Dl.png](https://i.imgur.com/rFxV3Dl.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For arcimoto, based on the formula 174 MPGe to mi/kWh = 5.16 mi/kWh. We can tell that the battery size for FUV car will be 20Kwh and will likely be standard 16850 cells. So at a price of $262 per Kwh/pack, that comes to a total of $5,240‚Ä¨ for the battery. Or in other words about $12,000 for the whole car, and a selling price of $20,000 thats really profitable. Currently they have over 2,000 preorders, so that would equal about $16million in profit. That's enough to give them a positve earnings per share once they start shipping.",2020-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/f9xhxk/fuv_3_wheel_electric_cars_i_did_the_math_they/

**Guyana Goldstrike Selects Drill Targets at Toucan Ridge Discovery Area, Marudi Gold Project, Guyana**

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. (GYA.V /GYNAF) has selected drill targets at the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

The company's 2018/2019 trenching program successfully outlined a new mineralized area that continues for more than 1.75 kilometres along Toucan Ridge. Toucan Ridge is roughly one kilometre northeast of the Mazoa Hill zone, which currently contains the project's mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein).

A diamond drill program of up to 12 holes is planned and may be extended. The planned drill program will predominately focus on Toucan Ridge, where a total of 2,458 metres of trenching were completed and 837 samples were taken.

Drill targets have been chosen from identified magnetic anomalies and gold assays from surface trenching and sampling of the quartzite-metachert host rock.

The specific drill locations will be in proximity to trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8, as priority targets, followed potentially by drilling trench areas TTR-18-9, TTR-18-11, TTR-18-12 and TTR-18-13.

In 2018, trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 assayed grades as high as 7.2 grams per tonne gold over three metres.

The first drill pads will be positioned to drill angled holes across the area of trenches TTR-18-7 and TTR-18-8 to an initial planned depth of 130 metres and a maximum depth of 200 metres.

In preparation for the next phase of exploration, the technical team has reviewed the legacy data, including drill assays, drill angles, collar location, grade and interval lengths, from past drilling on the property in order to further refine its exploration efforts at Marudi. The compilation of these historic drill assays will provide important information that the technical team will use to calibrate drilling on the property.

The assay highlights disclosed herein are from the Mazoa Hill zone, which is approximately one kilometre southwest of the Toucan Ridge discovery area.

Assay highlights of Sutton Resources' diamond drill programs at the Mazoa Hill zone (1991 to 1994):

* MR 91-068 -- six metres of 29.97 grams per tonne gold within 72 metres of 5.11 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 91-074 -- 15 metres of 15.30 grams per tonne gold within 75 metres of 4.60 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-102 -- 52 metres of 4.06 grams per tonne gold within 190 metres of 2.39 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-113 -- 36 metres of 7.74 grams per tonne gold within 141 metres of 3.31 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-115 -- 45 metres of 10.82 grams per tonne gold and 30 metres of 15.16 grams per tonne gold within 81 metres of 7.71 grams per tonne gold;
* MR 94-120 -- 12 metres of 16.65 grams per tonne gold within 57 metres of 4.51 grams per tonne gold.

Mineral resource estimates

The Mazoa Hill zone contains the company's current mineral resource estimate. Data analyzed suggest that the mineralized zone is open in several directions, including at depth:

* 243,300 indicated gold ounces within 3,637,000 tonnes grading 2.1 grams per tonne;
* 78,800 inferred gold ounces within 1,278,000 tonnes grading 1.9 grams per tonne.

26,Scanner release - need feedback!!,fa2bgx,toddmhorst,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fa2bgx/scanner_release_need_feedback/,1,0,"I've just finished working on my stock scanner. It's meant to find the ""best of the best"" stocks for swing traders and investors.

I won't go into too many details on how I find good candidates, but if it has a high dividend, been bullish, making new highs, or otherwise killing it for the last year it should show up. Of course, it's all automated, so there are always some stocks that may sneak in that aren't supposed to be there, or be left out... In other words, you still have to do your due diligence.

The reason I created it is because everywhere I looked I would find a small list that match this criteria, and then another small list for that criteria. My list has them all in one bucket, so you can see when something matches more than one of your criteria.

I do have a lot of data points, so I have several views, but clicking on any symbol will display all of its data. All the view show the same set of symbols, just sorted differently and with different data immediately visible.

Here is a YouTube video demonstrating it's use.
https://youtu.be/h4AD7vTPWTk

Some features:
-Sort any column or combination of columns
-Hide a security if you don't want to see it
-Works great on mobile or desktop
-Refreshes each night to get you 500-1000 symbols each with the newest data
-Quick search for a symbol/name
-Filter based on criteria you define
-View symbol chart in modal, pop up window, or new tab

Cost-
For the next month (until 4/1, no joke) I am allowing the demo account FREE unrestricted access to the full list of symbols. After that, I'll only return the top 20 (which will still helpful). At that point you'll need to have a paid account to view the whole list. An account costs $9.99 a month.

What else you get-
My site helps you track your stock/option positions. It's easy and quick to enter them in, and for options it properly handles rolling or adjusting positions. By using stats, the goal is for me to help you see where you are successful. Hopefully this will empower you to develop a strategy that you are comfortable with and that is profitable.

What I need from you-
I need you to use the demo account (provided under the sign in form) to log in, see what you like and don't like (about site in general and scanner specifically), and let me know. I'm just a developer who likes to invest in options, so any feature ideas, needed stats, and bug fixes will help me and my users. Of course, if you find value or just want to support the project, I'd love for you to sign up as well. The scanner is located under the 'Leads' menu.

Coming next-
Trade alerts are coming next. I'm not a guru, but I have had success and learned a lot in the past year and a half. Alerts will allow me to share my trades, AS WELL as allow you to share your trades.

I won't be charging extra for any of these features, so I really believe it is worth your money, and is completely affordable to all.

I posted a [video ](https://youtu.be/3epTlJnn3Jc) but figured I'd have a text version too just in case. 

**TNXP** Only interested if this gaps up back above $1 - that would be the scenario in which any overnight shorts are scared + longs feel comfortable to jump back in. IF we gap over $1 I'd look to trade a push at the open testings today's highs.

**CODX** I'm not one to try to predict things, because trying to predict how a stock is going to move is a very risky thing. I'd rather wait until I have more information to go off of in the premarket tomorrow -- gapping after hours already so if we gap up again tomorrow morning, that would be the best case scenario.

**APT** this one has a lot of potential imo. I'd like to see this gap up in the PM + give an opportunity of weakness to get a lower entry towards $12 / $12.50 area depending on your risk level/sizing + trade a pop over highs at the open. Over today's highs this has room towards $15 area based on psychological levels.

**VXRT** swing I was in from $1.20 but sold out of today -- looking for potential day 2 continuation IF $1.50 holds higher low trend back towards today's highs.
