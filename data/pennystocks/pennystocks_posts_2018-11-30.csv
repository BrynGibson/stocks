0,Hemp to be legalized in the farm bill,a1nji9,vastlywealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a1nji9/hemp_to_be_legalized_in_the_farm_bill/,1,11,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/hemp-legalization-is-officially-in-the-final-farm-bill/

This can only benefit the stock HEMP. 

.0319 is the the current price of HEMP, and that‚Äôs high now compared to not too long ago (before I saw this article). 

It‚Äôs supposed to be passed before the end of the year, so within like 30 days.

Undecided if I should buy some because I don‚Äôt want to buy on this hype for it to remain stagnant while I have bills to pay lol. 

Once passed, do you think this stock has potential to shoot up a couple bucks or would that be unrealistic?

Sick of my low paying job. Looking for a miracle to have enough funds to start a business. One where it wouldn‚Äôt be such a high financial risk like if I were to do it now. Can this be the answer?  Or should I keep dreaming?

**Amazon Teams up With Cheech and Chong Following Their Buy-out From Cannabis¬†Company.**

Whats more interesting is the possibility now that PSIQ might be involved with Cheech and Chong in a new movie deal.

&gt;*IMDb Just Confirmed that a new ‚ÄúCheech &amp; Chong‚Äù movie is in production, with a release date yet to be determined. This comes after the rights to Cheech &amp; Chong was bought out by marijuana company,* [*Profile Solutions Inc., (PSIQ).*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/psiq?ltr=1)

That seems pretty cut and dry. Though, there is one small mention in the press release about the deal stating that Profile Solutions Inc. has also ‚Äúacquired other distribution rights.‚Äù
