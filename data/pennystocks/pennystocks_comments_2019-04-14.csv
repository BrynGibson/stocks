Being the largest producer in a country slightly larger than Rhode Island isn‚Äôt the greatest accomplishment. 

Production comes from old wells which produce steady but they barely draw a profit from these. Add to that limited reserve life remaining. 

They have basically ceased development spending on their producing wells and seem to be going all in on the three exploration wells you mentioned. 

I mean there is some potential with exploring in a relatively under explored area and a country TXP is knowledgeable in. 

Might be favourable to develop a new reserve and flip to a bigger company with cash to develop and produce but overall T&amp;T doesn‚Äôt have a favourable production environment with a 12.5% royalty rate on gross production.
