3,Advice on $CRMD?,935nfe,phila18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/935nfe/advice_on_crmd/,21,22,I fell ass backwards into some success on CRMD. Iâ€™m in around $0.35 at a few hundred bucks and now itâ€™s up around $0.70. Havenâ€™t done a ton of research but the pumpers are pumping and of course saying $1 soon. I donâ€™t necessarily need the money right now but also would like to not lose the profits Iâ€™ve made. Any advice here or thoughts on CRMD? Very new to the market. ,2018-07-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/935nfe/advice_on_crmd/

8,"How the heck to sell paper certificate restricted shares, of cannabis company, trading on OTC Pink at ~$3.00?",93817l,reelznfeelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/93817l/how_the_heck_to_sell_paper_certificate_restricted/,1,4,"Hey, I was paid in restricted shares of a marijuana company about 11 months ago.  The shares will vest soon and I want to liquidate some of them.  However, no one I've called will take the certificate because it's $5 and/or because they don't allow marijuana stocks.  Price of this company has been steadily down, I really want to liquidate as soon as they vest.  

Any advice?  

Thanks!",2018-07-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/93817l/how_the_heck_to_sell_paper_certificate_restricted/
