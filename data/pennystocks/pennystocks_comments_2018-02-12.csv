They are a small company, so people panicked and the stock plummeted.

It came to light later that both those patients had previously had hepatitis and lied to get into the trial. 

A strong lesson for an Antibe and so the screening process became much more thorough going forward.

Since then they have passed their trials with flying colours, but their biggest issues have been finances. They didn't have enough capital to go to phase 2b testing, and the company they had purchased for revenue flow took a lose, which raised some questions about management and whether they would be able to afford to go forward. They took out an offering, and again the stock dropped. But because of this they were able to raise the funds to get through phase 2b and plan to partner with a major pharma on its completion. 

The revenue company they bought (Citagenix) has also since partnered with the biggest dental supply company in the US, which should solidify their revenue stream.

All in all this company is on a serious upward swing.

This would allow patients to have the benefits of NSAID drugs (effective, non addictive) without the horrendous side effects traditional NSAIDS have on your stomach. 

Note that this would be most likely be marketed for people on LONG TERM pain treatment with NSAIDS, as taking them in short bursts is perfectly safe for most people (example Advil every day for a week to deal with a sprained ankle or a dental procedure).

So that is the risk the comes with any pharma stock, pre FDA approval. It's also where the money is made. Once this is approved, then the price is going to really take off.

The good news is, the further into the trial a company is, the less the risk. If someone came back with adverse side effects, they would can this thing immediately (see phase one on their first trial drug, January 2015)

They have already passed phase 2a, which was to see if the drug worked, this phase (2b) is to see if it is safe, and compare it directly to Naproxen. If any test subject on ATB-346 had any adverse side effects, we would know by now. Obviously I can't predict the future, but the risk/reward is a huge draw.

They are wanting to partner right away:

Antibe expects to begin global partnering discussions for ATB-346 in Q1 2018   subsequent to the release of the Phase 2 GI safety data (from their investor presentation)

This may be a quick thing, or take 12-18 months. Your guess is as good as mine. I believe though that because of their financial position, they are going to want to partner sooner than later (see offering between 2a and 2b)

I imagine they meant to the beginning to phase 3, so probably good to finish the dosage trial, but not a chance they do phase 3 on their own. That being said, Citagenix(the company they purchased to generate revenues) just partnered with the largest dental supply company in the US, and the financials coming out at the end of February will give us a better idea what that looks like.

In terms of the partnership, there are so many speculations that I have no idea what to believe. 

Zack's evaluation (third party stock evaluation company) has the evaluation at .85 with a 50% chance of trial success. By that logic, 100% success would be $1.70.

Celebrex and Aleve were both bought for billions (60 and 2.9) but both were past phase 3 and in commercial production. 

Dan Legault mention in the capital conference interview that this was ""a multi billion dollar opportunity""

There are 259,500,000 shares total. 2 billion dollar buy out puts it at $7.71/share.

160,vijeetgv,e00fjok,/r/pennystocks/comments/7x4kkq/anyone_heard_ofhave_comments_about_the_seven/e00fjok/,1,I bought one of these 'newsletter' stocks a few years ago...it never works. Those stocks went down &amp; down &amp; down after I bought them...&amp; then eventually I had to sell them. Checked price of one of them...their price is still right there. Crap. I guess these people have invested early in their companies &amp; now running these marketing newsletters to have people buy them at slightly higher prices so that they can sell their crap.,2018-02-12
