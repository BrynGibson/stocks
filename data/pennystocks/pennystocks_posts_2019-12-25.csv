I do my best to break it down for you guys. And why I filter it the way I do. I’m not a professional. Just a trader sharing things that I’ve learned throughout my journey.

2,Real talk about $NIO,efa3xg,AdamCaveRoberts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/efa3xg/real_talk_about_nio/,1,54,"I am deep in this b\*\*\*\*. My average cost is 6.40. I road it up 25-30+% before its giant drop off from $10, and I was destroyed when I didn't sell. I have now been holding a beautiful bag of -60-70% down for the past year. This stock holding also takes up a huge 20% of my total portfolio. 

I have been monitoring them as a brand, as a company, and their sales numbers of the ES6 are 60% better than last year. They are planning to announce something this week as well as their peculiarly timed ER this week (or nextish) as well.

I can't help to think this is finally the time to average down about 10-20% of my total position. This chart is asking for something good to break out. 

Anyone watching this thing?
