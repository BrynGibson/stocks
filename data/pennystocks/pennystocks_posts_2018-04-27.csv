ANDI suprised us all by actually showing a real phone in flesh and blood. The volume is back in it and I think right before close like 2 minutes before it will be a good one to hold over the weekend as otc is safer in this market for overnight in my opinion. There is supposed to be some PR coming soon from this stock so time to watch again. 

UHLN I heavily considered getting in yesterday when I found it in the morning. OTC multiday breakout and looks interesting for sure. Of course the riskiest but the highest reward. Again not touching until last minute. 

RNVA has a formal meeting next week and the postpone caused the stock to crash. Now it is available at a bargin and news is expected. Some fun to watch. Something good may happen and I expect a huge pop by Wednesday. ",2018-04-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8fe9ti/overnight_plays_for_427_andi_uhln_rnva/

MIAMI BEACH, Fla., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- SNM Global Holdings (OTC:SNMN) is excited to announce the assembly of a group of medical cannabis industry experts from the financial, medical, and legal sectors.

During the recent legislative session in the Maryland legislature, a bill was passed to authorize the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission to reopen the application process and grant several additional Medical Cannabis Grower and Processor licenses throughout the state.  We will be working diligently over the next several months to complete the application process, identify key areas within the state of Maryland for suitable facilities, and engage horticulture experts, as well as seasoned medical operations personnel to position SNM to be awarded either one or both of these new license opportunities.

""SNM is excited to have become involved with industry experts in each stage of the medical cannabis arena, from grow operations all the way down to retail sales at the dispensary level,"" stated SNM CEO Troy Lowman, ""the legal counsel we have retained to assist us with our Grower and Processing applications to the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission has a proven track record of assisting their clients in acquiring various medical cannabis licenses.""  “It is very humbling to realize we will be a part of a rapidly developing industry that will help so many people achieve quality of life living while with cancer and so many other diseases,” says Lowman.

The process from application to becoming fully operational is expected to take approximately 365 days.

IRVINE, CA, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signature Devices, Inc. (OTC PINK: SDVI) today announced that it has successfully filed its annual filing on time for 2017. Based in Orange County, the tech firm presented a solution that can help save lives and minimize pain and suffering in case of a school emergency.   Innovo Technology is an engineering company that has designed a portable product, the Knoton, that can be used individually for personal safety or at schools so that it can minimize the impact of any kind of emergency. The Knoton, a crucial Emergency Notification System (ENS), can be operated at schools to minimize the impact of any emergency that takes place on campus.  The company has been developing this solution for the last couple of years. It is a smart device that can be used to trigger warnings and alert students early enough to avoid major injuries and casualties.

The Knoton provides a crucial ENS and acts as a school emergency system that can alert all students, guardians, faculty members, and activate the school’s audible speaker system announcing the emergency loudly. The Knoton will also send an E911 signal (when available) to emergency personnel so that immediate response can take place.  All this happens in an instant. Upon launch the Knoton will have auto-notification based on events such as gunshot sounds using Innovo Technology cloud based AI algorithms to identify such events.

The initial prototype video is on the company’s YouTube channel. The backend support of the project is complete.  Innovo Technology is seeking funding to complete the full prototype and get the Knoton to production. “We are extremely eager to bring this to schools, children, parents, and anyone who is concerned about safety. Your contribution is crucial to us bringing this necessary product to the market,” said Inas Azzam the CEO of Innovo Technology.  “We have all been struck with depressing news about children, students, and teachers experiencing horrific emergencies especially at schools. Schools are meant to be a safe haven for students and children. We want minimize the tragedies that are caused by these emergencies and stem the flow of horrifying daily news by implementing our Knoton solution in every school,” Mr. Azzam went on to say.

The Project is on Kickstarter,  supporters can visit the page and contribute to making their favorite school and facilities safer for their children and educators.  Supporting the campaign, helps get schools equipped with this solution.

The company also plans on announcing its quarterly revenue for Q1 2018 next week with some exciting updates.
