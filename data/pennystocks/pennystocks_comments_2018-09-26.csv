168,wannaberichguy777,e6qtujj,/r/pennystocks/comments/9j6ezc/fsddf_dd_update/e6qtujj/,1,"ya i mean DD right, but i think if it can make 4k units at 43k = 172 million 
and 6k units at 32k a year = 192 million = 364 million a year not including other jobs they have and also building material cost. still , thats what they will make from that Ghana deal alone . ",2018-09-26

Now you’re expecting it to go back up when you’re 21 days late to when it initially started running. Relative volume is dying off and techs are giving sell signals. That’s my reasoning ,2018-09-26

These small cap stocks are hardly ever worth it to invest in, only short term to ride the pump and short the dump. They're almost all kinda dog shit really. Unless you really know how to read SEC filings and weed out the BS that's in there (cuz they want to hide stuff from you), I wouldn't invest in low floats.

But I wouldn't be that afraid, now that it has had its huge volume, people won't forget this stock and will probably spike again in a few months time, just like now when end of june was its first time it spiked with heavy volume.",2018-09-26

It's dropped half to what it was when I bought in. Anyways, I dropped $300 (as a 13 yr old that scared the life out of me haha) and have since made $120 back just this week because I changed my strategy. 

Instead of attempting for that extra $1, I take profit and look for the next area to go into. I now also very much value stop losses and have a good plan now.
