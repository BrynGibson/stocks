Every investor looks at different things. Especially when it comes to penny stocks; penny stocks are things investors take flyers on. 

Also it’s pretty clear your looking to trade rather then invest. When it comes to making money trading penny stocks it’s all about the pump and dump. These stocks go up and down in sometimes less then 6 hour periods. It’s not about knowing investor sentiment but trader sentiment.",2019-09-10

However on the pump &amp; dump with penny stocks or is it volatility ? 

I think all stocks have volatility inherently in them.

Penny stocks are speculative jrs. companies and are the worst.

12,Ancientdollars,ezts7h1,/r/pennystocks/comments/d22byg/is_this_a_good_move_that_a_junior_company/ezts7h1/,1,"Some of it is natural volatility but in my opinion a lot of it is pump and dump. Penny stocks have a very low trade volume normally and combined with their low price, it takes very little to get the stock price to move. Usually what you will see happen when trading penny stocks is you will see a piece of “news” break. The stock will have a giant swing over a few hours, I’m talking sometimes doubling in price. The people pumping it will eventually bail out, you have a few unlucky people left holding the bag. And by the end of trading for the day the stock will have fallen all the way back down to its original price if not lower. 

When I took my turn at trading penny stocks I often watched the trading volume of stocks to avoid these things. If a stock was trading around 100k shares a day and all a sudden you see a million shares being traded, chances are the stock is getting pumped. As soon as the people pumping it bail, all that volume goes away and the price plummets.",2019-09-10
