*Adds Technology, Expansion to West Coast, and Revenue*

**TOCCOA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / August 8, 2019 / Galaxy Next Generation, Inc**. (OTCQB:[GAXY](http://pr.report/0s9baOyq)) (""Galaxy"" or the ""Company), a provider of interactive learning technology solutions, today announced the signing of a letter of intent to acquire a west coast based audio company focused on creating innovative products that provide fundamental tools used for building notification systems. 

The proposed acquisition is for a combination of cash and stock. The target company generated approximately $4 million in revenue through the twelve month period ending June 30, 2019. 

The targets products and services allow institutions access to intercom, scheduling and notification systems they use every day with improved ease of use. It provides an open architecture solution which allows its products to be used in many existing and new environments. Intercom, PA, Bell and control solutions are easily added and integrated with its first to market open architecture design and current software model. Its products combine elements not normally found together over a common IP network, which minimizes infrastructure requirements and reduces costs by combining systems. This strategy also places it at the forefront of school safety and communication.

Gary LeCroy, Galaxys Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are excited to add innovative audio technology to our product suite, as its something that our end customers, especially in the K-12 market segment have been demanding. This is evident by their strong revenue growth in the first half of 2019. Webelieve this is the first company to provide an open architecture solution that allows existing components to be used and to look beyond the space of intercom to extend capabilities of the system for other applications. The proposed acquisition also has 4 patents pending and expands our geographical footprint to the west coast. We are looking forward to advancing this transaction to the definitive stage and expect to close by the end of September.",2019-08-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cno0yc/gaxy_galaxy_next_generation_signs_letter_of/

Company updates shareholders as operations expand

IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- UA Multimedia, Inc. (OTC: UAMM), is pleased to announce that the Company has plans to launch its Crypto Consultancy Division. With a focus on the most current and advantageous blockchain strategies, this new sector‚Äôs goal is to bring expert consulting to evaluate and design cryptocurrency solutions that can thrive in an ecosystem where the infrastructure is rapidly evolving and changing.  


Mr. Michael Lajtay, President and interim CEO, has dealt in cryptocurrencies since 2014. ¬†Having served as a cryptocurrency consultant, trainer and speaker, he brings a wealth of knowledge to the table having also participated in a number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and assisted in the launch of several sophisticated mining operations.  


‚ÄúBlockchain Technology is still in its infancy, and competing currencies vary widely. ¬†Accordingly, factors such as decentralization, tamper resistance, and transparency still cannot be guaranteed,‚Äù stated Mr. Lajtay.¬† ‚ÄúEquipped with the latest technical familiarity our representatives can tailor unique solutions that ideally suit individual and corporate digital currency goals,‚Äù continued Lajtay.

The Company is in the process of bringing its status current with OTC Markets, as management expands the corporate business model and further develops the overall focus. ¬†

Looking beyond the Cannabis industry, blockchain and cryptocurrency consultancy is set to bring an array of skilled services to the table which are expected to include structuring, white paper drafting, token creation, targeted marketing, and the management of exchange listings and other cryptocurrency related matters. ¬†The Company also plans to offer a listing service for tokenized projects or ICOs available for potential investors worldwide.  


The Company also plans to offer or market tokenized projects in the area of cannabis, general business and real estate with the following strategy in place:

* Cannabis Sector: Projects related to Cannabis seeking funding can be tokenized with token owners receiving dividends from the project earnings.
* General Business: Businesses seeking funding can be tokenized with token owners receiving dividends from the business earnings.
* Real Estate Industry: Real Estate development or acquisition of residential or commercial properties in the US or abroad can be tokenized with token owners receiving dividends from the property sales, management fees or rental income.
* Based on the project requirements, certain tokens can also be listed to trade on various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Modification to UA Multimedia‚Äôs existing online presence will be made to reflect the new direction and focus.

Additional details relating to the Company‚Äôs new business will be provided as progresses are made.
