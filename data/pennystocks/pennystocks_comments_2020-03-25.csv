Also just cause a stimulus plan is “proposed” does not mean that it will be the savior of the market.

It looks really interesting if you do buy sell within an hour it’s probably gonna make some money but then it’ll drop. After hours it’s up to 2$.

My guess is people are going to spike it up tomorrow then it’ll dip. Then it’s going to go down for two days then the pump will happen because everybody sold. Make your own conclusion though. Anybody who claims they know what’s gonna happen is wrong.

The reason it dropped was because it’s drug missed it’s primary entry point. No clue what that means but it can’t be good if it dropped 80% people are saying it should be around 3$ though so make your best call.",2020-03-25

128,Ramon_1990,flg1p31,/r/pennystocks/comments/fojjln/mist/flg1p31/,1,"If we’re talking logic then yes it should rebound. Big time. It’s the same story for every one-drug pharma where an eventual collapse is inevitable should their product fail. This one failed at the final stage. Had they got the approval it would’ve sent it above it’s IPO launch. Current climate made it worse and got a bigger dump than usual one-drug pharma failures.

It’s only unfortunate that they got the rejection on the Corona dip, as everyone would want to invest their principle on more “secure” assets. Had $MIST got their rejection last year, you would’ve expected lots of investors jumping in at this entry point.

If we’re talking numbers then again, it should rebound big time also. The company has enough cash and assets to buy back every share at around $7. This is huge and probably the most important note to take. Therefore they can give up on their product and choose to diversify/cease trading however technically they can’t go bankrupt anytime soon.

SHORT TERM: I would certainly bet on this stock to rebound today and it’s dip attraction would pump it up for the next few weeks. In the meantime you would expect PR from the pharma to state their next step of actions which would then stimulate another increase in share price. 

LONG TERM: I would also bet on this stock long term given that the efficacy of their drug was proven and positive up until the third phase, and being a one-drug pharma means their efforts are into one single product and they are the sole pharma going after PSVT. It is assumed that there are more people with SVT related condition than the official numbers since not everybody goes through a thorough scan or only shows mild symptoms. With so many people now using smart watches and analysing their heart rate as well as sharing their data (with consent), this area of pharma is only bound to grow and support further studies.",2020-03-25

329,S_A_N_D_,flgyqof,/r/pennystocks/comments/fopkcu/hold_those_aytu_bags/flgyqof/,1,"Unfortunately you have that backwards. An effective vaccine elicits an immune response which triggers the production of antibodies. 

What you are thinking is serum prophylaxis and post exposure prophylaxis which sometimes can be confused with vaccines. Those are short term treatments where you give the person purified antibodies instead of a vaccine since vaccines can take weeks to months before the person has generated a sufficient antibody titer themselves. The benefit is the person gets immediate protection, the downside is it's short lived. 

One of the ways you test to see if a vaccine is working (or if a person has received a vaccine) is to test for antibodies. 

All of this doesn't really matter since AYTU didn't make antibodies either, but rather they just made a test that detects antibodies. They essentially combined a portion of the virus (to which the antibodies react) with a method of detection that can tell when an antibody has bound.  The market however has been flooded with these test and you can find them online right now to buy because they were tested in China but never actually deployed since they don't really help you right now. They'll have a place later when you want to determine if you have been infected and what portion of the population was infected (and is therefor immune), however they don't really help you prevent the spread right now. 

This stock is trading on hype and ignorance. This is why the company capitalized on the stock price to raise funds, and why it's in a slow decline. The test might be useful in the future but the current price doesn't necessarily reflect that and only reflects the trigger words and hype.

&gt;""The COVID-19 IgG/IgM is a rapid test intended for the presumptive qualitative detection of IgG/IgM antibodies from the SARS-CoV-2-virus in blood samples from individuals with signs and symptoms of infection who are suspected of COVID-19.""

https://aytubio.com/covid-19/

From that I can tell you that it's testing to see if the person has generated an immune response to the virus. This immune response takes time (days to weeks). It also persists long after you cleared the virus which is why you don't keep getting sick from the same infections over and over. Your immune system essentially has a memory of past infections which is why you become immune to new infections from the same pathogen. Because this is testing to see if you've generated an adaptive immune response, and that immune response lasts for years (possibly a lifetime), you can't tell if someone is actually infected. It's also a qualitative test (instead of quantitative) which means you can't infer how recent the infection was (not that a quantitative test would be useful anyways since recent infection doesn't tell you if you are currently infected either)",2020-03-25

Novacyt announces that it has signed a manufacturing agreement under contract with Yourgene Health, an international molecular diagnostic group, which will support it in the production of the Covid-19 test developed by Primerdesign, Novacyt's molecular diagnostic division.

Yourgene's advanced GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) manufacturing site, located at Citylabs in Manchester, UK, will be used to increase production capacity for the Novacyt test.

To speed up the process, Yourgene will initially manufacture the critical components of the test. The two companies could extend the agreement to include production of final versions of the test in due course.",2020-03-25

At the end of the day, nobody knows where it will land. 

All we know right now is that they have some heavy projections, and seen to be trying very hard to meet them.

**If** everything goes swimmingly, they get big-kahuna distributing partners, and meet their projections, in 12 months.... Well, that would be fucking amazing.

DECN has a clean history and some serious friends for their current products. I personally intend to hold for quite a while, unless something happens in the future that justifies getting out.

But, at the end of the day, clean history or not, we're dealing with Penny stocks. It's always risky, and that is why nobody should invest more than they can afford to lose.

But you want to make sure you get in and/or out for the right reasons.

If you did your DD, and you believe they're going to succeed based on that due diligence, then hold.

Like the other day, or today, people sell to take a profit, which drives the stock price down, which triggers panic selling.

If you did your DD, and you trust the company will succeed, then panic selling at a loss is a terrible idea. But at the same time, bad news could come out tomorrow. My point wasn't that you should never sell, it was just that there was no bad press to drive the stock down, and panic selling is bad in those cases.  But that doesn't mean you should never sell.

I just got into trading about 10 days ago and have learned a lot of lessons already and I'm much more ready to accept the ""profit is profit"" philosophy and get out when I can instead of holding onto the shares for longer and risking losing everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I want out of DECN asap but at the same time I've already lost half of my investment. I have nothing more to lose at this point with DECN except my last half of $500 and I thought heavily about just selling my shares tomorrow and taking my $500 and going home but I'm going to practice just ""holding and forgetting"" until news start to show. I'm not afraid to lose my investment but at the same time show me 1 person who doesn't feel some type of hurt when they lose 50% of their investment. I'm hoping this DECN experience I'm going through will make me a better investor in the future.. some lessons I've learned:

1. Watch the stock for a few days before investing in. Learn its patterns and figure out its base price and see how volatile it really is before wanting to jump in.
2. Don't go all in. I put the max amount of money I'm comfortable with losing ($1k) into DECN, I should of invested only 25% or 50% of that max if I was feeling ballsy.. never again am I investing my whole piggy bank into 1 stock unless it's over time. Like 25% the first week and if its doing good maybe 50% more the following week.
3. profit is profit. I want to trade for the long term. I got into this 10 days ago thinking if I invest in the right company I'll make $100k+ that's not reasonable.. I should be happy taking $100-300 profits and selling instead of holding onto something in fear of missing out on more.

For example, jnug and nugt mirror each other except one nugt moves at a 1x rate, then jnug will move 3x. Jdst is betting for bear, meaning in this case that gold prices will go down. Jnug is betting for bull. Easiest way to explain, if you think gold prices go up then buy jnug, think gold goes down means buy jdst. Jnug and nugt are the same as they mirror each other but jnug moves at 3x rate, basically a higher volatility rate. Ur basically gambling on gold prices.
