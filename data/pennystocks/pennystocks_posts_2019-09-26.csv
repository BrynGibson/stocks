Initiates Candidate Gold Mine Acquisition Assessments,d9j0sc,daytradeguru,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d9j0sc/news_aabb_asia_metals_inc_initiates_candidate/,4,1,"LAS VEGAS, Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Asia Broadband Inc. (AABB), through its wholly owned subsidiary Asia Metals Inc., today announced its initiation of the assessments and due diligence of several candidate gold mine acquisitions, subsequent to the Company's acquisition team's recent travel to multiple locations in South America, Central America and Mexico. Additionally, the Company's team has further acquisition property site visits planned this month with its mineral lands agent specializing in the Americas region, geological consultant to assess production profit potential and representatives from the Company's Joint Venture Partner to analyze the expansion potential of each site location. The expectations of the acquisition initiative are to secure one or more new gold properties with high development potential in the 3rd or 4th quarter of this year.

The Company's new gold mine acquisition campaign is targeting properties that have historic gold production in South America, Central America and Mexico. The focus of the campaign is to duplicate the successful acquisition model of the Company's existing high-density, shallow gold mine property in Guerrero, Mexico, that had known historical gold vein structures prior to AABB's full-scale development and production expansion.

Asia Broadband Inc. (OTC : AABB), through its wholly owned subsidiary Asia Metals Inc., is a resource company focused on the production, supply and sale of precious and base metals, primarily to Asian markets. The Company utilizes its specific geographic expertise, experience and extensive industry contacts to facilitate its innovative distribution process from the production and supply of precious and base metals in Guerrero, Mexico, to our client sales networks in Asia. This vertical integration approach to sales transactions is the unique strength of Asia Broadband and differentiates the Company to its shareholders.
