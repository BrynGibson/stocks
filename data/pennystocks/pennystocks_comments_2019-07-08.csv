Regardless of wether it will be a huge success (which I think it will) or failure, the hype and coming pump will spike this thing. How high exactly is anyone‚Äôs guess but it‚Äôs gonna have PR, and the pumpers will go wild with it for s short time. Plenty time left to get in and make hundreds of percents.

GEVO seems to be at a 6-month high but is coming off of good news regarding it's product. However, it is also at a 6-month high which is a negative to me that it could just as easily fall off.

PIXY seems to be riding the news wave of earning results coming out next week. If I'm reading this right, that means that people are jumping aboard the hype-train. I guess the question is how high can it go?

AMR feels like it hit it's peak and has slowly fallen back down all in one day. What gives you confidence it keeps going?",2019-07-08

Things like this to cover every base and avoid any kind of counter claims. Case being, every day I cruz several news outlets to look for a day Trade. Every day there are multiple firms bringing cases against company‚Äôs for failing to do X, Y or Z.
