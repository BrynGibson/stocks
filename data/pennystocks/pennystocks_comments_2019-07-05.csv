I have gradually bought and sold a penny stock holding over a number of weeks as it flux’d to the point where I still retain a healthy amount of shares but have extracted all the money I originally invested. 

So for example I put in $1000 at .01 for 100,000 stocks and as it fluctuated I have pulled out my entire initial investment of $1000 but still have 100,000 shares. At this point, I don’t have any capital gains to pay do I? And whatever I sell the 100,000 for later is pure capital gains, right?",2019-07-05

They could be worth just the par value in a moments notice. I am not an investment or tax pro but I would say play to win not to break even. In situations where volatility is possible be the banker not the dumb money at the counter. What I mean is you invested $1000 for what gain? If you can get that gain now get it. The leftover is your retained upside. If you went in saying I want to spend 1,000 and make 2,000 make that happen and maybe cover the tax too. THen let the shares that remain ride. Otherwise your strategy is kind of break even bases and not many penny stocks are worthy of a long position.",2019-07-05

I mostly do biostocks, so I keep up to date with what they are creating in the lab. Stage of clinical trial, type of disease they are going after, how many people the disease kills, how many they can help,, etc.

Keep an eye out for news and dates of when information is released and I either get into it the day of information is released or beforehand and take a chance that news will be good. It also helps that I have experience in biology and chemistry as well, so I can understand a lot of the clinical trial results that come out.

Then you have that data, by quickly going through it you can determine if the data is actually good. So many times these Twitter analysts will say good data will come out because they ""met there end goal and can go to stage 2"" .... Yea, that doesn't automatically mean it's good and can even drop the stock. Even FDA approval is not always a guarantee.

Take that PTN stock as example. While everyone was hyped and excited and saying PTN was going to go to $2+ , I was one of the few that actually read the results and realized that these results were shit and that once people realized it, stock would drop.

I still get people telling me ""just wait until sales start, you'll see "" . Well by researching the other drugs that were on the market for the same thing, you can easily determine that 6-10 million will be the sales, not a lot for something that barely works -.-

However, I'm up at the crack of dawn doing research and posting what I find. It's to the point where I'm even faster than the sites that you have to pay to get the ""latest news and information and which stocks to pick"" and ""signal"" groups can't even keep up with it, lol.",2019-07-05

You are only taxed on what you sold. You covering your initial investment of $1000 is or should likely show as a loss. It likely cost you money to make the purchase. You likely had to do some research maybe even buy level II reporting to get things dialed in. Those COST come off the break even and likey create a loss on the trade that breaks even. Those stocks that remain are seen as par value at best and literally paper is worth more because it hasn't been printed on. So the only thing you have to deal with is when you realize the gain. Not advice but people tend to wait until the end of the year for these concerns. If I have a big loser but I have big gains elsewhere I might sell the loser in December to bake in the losses. I can buy it back later if I really need it in my portfolio. I do like to wait as long as possible because you never know or if you know it is a dog the losses can help offset the gains. Gambling is taxed similar, a person that makes money gambling (taxable) then can write off losses and expenses associated with making the win.",2019-07-05

Pretty much NASDAQ small caps.  For some traders this isn't a big deal, for others, they want the OTC pink sheet stocks wich Robin Hood doesn't have.  

Secondly, the PDT rule.  Many major brokers will protect their clients by letting them borrow money to protect against things like the PDT rule or other minor infractions when it comes to trading.  Interactive brokers for example has deposited money into my account when I dipped under 25k so I could continue to day trade.  They did it as a courtesy. Robin Hood is pretty aggressive as far as the trading laws go.  They give you a suspension and then a ban.   

Third, Robin Hood is considered a ""budget"" broker.   Major stock traders and major brokers treat Robin Hood and their users like amateurs.  So a lot of them will speak negatively about Robin Hood.

You really just need to spend a lot of time learning the process. There is a lot to learn, so as others have said, it’s best to start with a paper account. 

With that being said, here are some quick tips:

1. Learn the difference between a press release and an SEC filing.

2. Learn how to use www.otcmarkets.com to your advantage.

3. Learn how to use Investor’s Hub to your advantage. 

4. Understand that every single penny stock is being manipulated. Learn to profit from the manipulation.

5. Understand that a Pump and Dump scheme is when a shitty company gets hyped up, with the objective of selling shitty shares at an overvalued price. If trying to profit from riding the wave of a Pump and Dump, first learn how to master timing strategies.

6. Understand that a Dump and Pump scheme is when a valuable company gets hyped down, with the objective of buying valuable shares at an undervalued price. Understand that finding such a company is not as important as understanding how to use timing strategies to your advantage. 

7. Understand that a Dump and Dilute scheme (share selling scheme) means that the dilution is so extreme, that the stock basically just goes down exponentially, and with reverse splits mixed in, it just gets rinsed and repeated over and over.

8. Beware of convertible debt (beware of all penny stocks? Probably.)

9. Learn how to use technical analysis.

10. Learn chart patterns and how to profit from predictability in patterns.

11. 58 penny stocks uplisted from OTC markets to Nasdaq / NYSE in 2018. Out of about 10500 or do?About 1 in 200. 

12. If you’re playing the pump and dumps for short terms plays, understand that the fundamentals don’t mean anything during the pump.

13. You also might want to learn how to find good Nasdaq penny stocks to short ($1-$5 or $1-$10 Nasdaq stocks). Shorting OTC penny stocks never makes sense unless you are a market maker. 

14. Most importantly, IMO, learn what a market maker is, how he/it affects the markets. And learn how he makes money, regardless of whether the stock goes up or down. I’m going to also put this in #14 - learn what a Level 2 quote montage is, and learn how to use this information to your advantage.",2019-07-05
