MRS

Hi my name is vivid82 you might remember me
From such plays as CGC and the guy who called the financial collapse 33.35 seconds after it happened.
If you’re like me you’re tired of all these old
Pump n dumps. We all know the routine. Put out news releases management buys up using an offshore account to show volume and let the idiots come buy as management dumps into their buys.


But MRS things are
Different.

We have a BOD so well connected they may or may not know who killed biggie and Tupac.

We have a merger now completed that gives them access to 33 billion dollars in US TLS contracts.

We have a new secretary.

Denver, CO, Feb. 14, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- Ubiquitech Software Corp, through its subsidiary HempLife Today™, is announcing to shareholders that sales from its popular new Wholesale/Ambassador program more than tripled over the period from November 15th 2018, through January 31st 2019, with sales of over $50,000 in January alone. Through this initial test period the Company surpassed its initial target of 500 registered Ambassadors. Surpassing expectations and projections as well.  


The Company achieved this growth through offering the Wholesale/Ambassador program to its customer base as well as a growing online advertising campaign and through social media. The Company believes that this initial launch of the Wholesale/Ambassador program will continue to grow as more Company resources and personnel are added.

As a HempLife Today™ Ambassador, those who successfully register can pay a one-time fee of $195 and get instant access to wholesale pricing on all CannazALL™ CBD products derived from hemp. Ambassadors also receive sales brochures, salescards, the ability to offer discounts, the ability to offer products on their existing Website or have person to person sales, retail sales, and more. In addition, the Company will soon be offering the ability for Ambassadors to get their very own custom Website through HempLife Today™ and also have online processing and shipping of orders, creating a turn-key distributorship if desired.

CEO James Ballas stated, *“We are very excited about our initial launch of our Ambassador program and it portends great things to come. Our initial goal was to obtain 500 registered Ambassadors within the first 120 days and we have now achieved that in about half the time. With our first 500 Ambassadors our plan is to have a fully functioning and operating system of training, education, and distribution, and really get this right. We will then begin to accelerate adding more Ambassadors through 2019, and we certainly believe we will crush our original projections of 10,000 Ambassadors within five years.”*

Based on its initial launch, the Company believes that each successful Ambassador will produce an average of approximately $15,000 per year in revenues to the Company, and will keep shareholders aware of his projections if modified. The Company wants shareholders to know that these are early projections at this time, and the Company will have more data as the program grows.

COO Luke Dreyer said, “*Although it’s still too early to tell, we do believe that a very well trained and well educated Ambassador, that has a Company support system and utilizes all the tools we are creating, can easily create $15,000 per year in revenues to the Company, and we are certainly going to work to provide the tools that are needed for them to do this, and more.”*

Because of the success of this initial launch of the Wholesale/Ambassador program, the Company is currently hiring and training new personnel, and redirecting existing personnel, in order to build out the Ambassador support systems planned. Once fully operating the Ambassador support system will reach out to Ambassadors on a daily basis, offer training videos, regular online meetings, technical support, and other aspects to help Ambassadors succeed.

CEO James Ballas adds, *“To all shareholders, please understand that this is just the beginning of this exciting program, but we are very happy with our results of course. It is our plan to create the finest distribution system possible through our wholesale ambassador program and to have the growth we have been projecting in news. The wholesale ambassador program will be an integral part of this growth as we move through 2019, 2020, and beyond.”*

The Company will continue to keep shareholders updated on all Company news and its pending name and symbol change.",2019-02-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aqm3f6/ubqu_hemplife_today_announces_over_50k_in/
