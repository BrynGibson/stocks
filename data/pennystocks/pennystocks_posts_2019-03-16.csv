2,Limited private research group + affordable position consulting. interested?,b1q36i,asianbrolul,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1q36i/limited_private_research_group_affordable/,0,12,"If the title is something I work for a research/analyst group on a small family fund and I've recently developed some very interesting tools that can accurately show the market movement based off of extensive uses of organic present-time data on every time frame from Low - High. (proof + accuracy will be provided if interest is shown.)

Im a firm believer in the fact that you wont be a winner in anything without an edge over the mass and this is what will try my best to offer to you no matter what age/experience you have as a trader.

Im more than happy to show you that trading isn't about trading hours on end or screen time, its about KNOWING the price action/data signals/creating high reward-low risk trade opportunities by giving precise entrys.

I've recently been seeing many scam ""pump"" groups as well as ""premium/VIP/Inside signal rooms"" that are almost all scams/illegal all over reddit/telegram/discord and as a paid group you arent supposed to guarantee profit's but offer information that is accurate in the data provided as the ranges people trade are essentially different and the style of trading to use my information may be different (Scalp, Swing, Investing, etc.) I'd like to offer people something that will really truly help your trading rather than just following a blind leader who hasn't even created an edge for himself using basic indicators + ripping sheeps off.

Prime Example:

https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@p0o/what-you-need-to-know-about-private-paid-only-trading-channels

I dont want people to tail my trades but simply me running a small group of 100-250 people that I will personally work and consult with if they need the assistance of the tools I have developed (not used by anyone). I will also be posting 3-4 plays daily in fx/equities/crypto with extensive TA/FA, private consulting for certain tickers that YOU personally want to trade, and educational content that will help beginner -&gt; advanced traders all for an affordable price per month depending on different packages as i wont be able to consult with 250 people daily if that's what it eventually comes down to.

Im posting this in a few subreddits/telegrams/discords/etc. and will update back once I see the feedback to see if this is something what people are really seeking nowadays.

What are your guy's thoughts on the company. Apparently they're getting into biofuels, but I feel like this reverse stock split is a bad sign from what I've been reading.",2019-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1y2dg/atis_thoughts/

$LDSR has a current PPS of .0029 and is a start up cyber security company that has been doing a lot recently. They just got SEC approved a few days ago and hope to ultimately uplist. They have had many renewals for their products and continue to expand to South America and Europe.

I don't want to congest this post with a bunch of links, but this information is all available on their ihub page.

I am not trying to pump anything and am only posting this here to help contribute to the board because I lurk here a lot. Please do your own DD. This stock has seen a downtrend for the last few months, but I believe it looks ready to go back up. I will be transparent and say that I am holding a lot of shares at an average of .0022.",2019-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b1x1i1/ldsr/
