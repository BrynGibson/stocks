1,"DD into Golden Leaf Holdings (GLH, GLDFF)",8xbeo1,NineteenEighty9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8xbeo1/dd_into_golden_leaf_holdings_glh_gldff/,5,9,"Full disclosure: I purchased 110,000 shares of GLH a couple weeks ago after months of research, average cost $0.23. I plan on holding all my shares until at least 2028 (when the NA cannabis industry is projected to mature). I own an investment business &amp; am comfortable with the speculative nature of this stock. GLH is a very speculative investment, please be aware of the risks before investing. Please donâ€™t speculate unless you can afford to lose 100% of your investment.


Golden Leaf holdings (GLH, GLDFF)


I started studying GLH again a few months back while browsing Cannabis companies with operations in Canada and the US. Since then Iâ€™ve read every article, statement, quarterly report etcâ€¦ from GLH i could find. I initially stayed away from the company when I started investing in cannabis because they had a sketchy management team who didnâ€™t do any favours for shareholders, management has now changed. According to the new CEO William Simpson, the founder of Chalice Farms. The only thing left of the old management is the name (see interview linked below). From what I can gather when GLH bought out Chalice Farms last summer Simpson and his people lead a sort of corporate coup, booted the old management and took over. Simpson is now the CEO &amp; his Chalice farms co-founder is the COO (see investor presentation linked below for senior management bios)


This new team appears to have their heads on their shoulders. They have a great track record with Chalice Farms (an award winning dispensary chain with 7 locations in Oregon). My biggest concern with the industry is there is so much emphasis on cultivation that we could be risking an oversupply. On top of that thereâ€™s no distribution, itâ€™s great to grow the stuff but you have to be able to deliver it to the end consumer in a profitable way. This will hurt margins at all the producers, big &amp; small. Strategically GLH is in a fantastic position to grow rapidly when US legalization occurs, theyâ€™re either licensed or acquiring licenses in most legal US states &amp; Canada. They are nearly cash flow positive and currently have over $22m USD cash on hand. Once they receive their extraction license theyâ€™ll become profitable imo. Canaccord Genuity released a report recently staying the company is undervalued.

The plan to sell Chalice farms franchises for $50k is a great way to grow distribution. The biggest value add products in the industry are oils, extracts &amp; edibles, by franchising distribution itâ€™ll help provide some consistent cash flow as well  as a distribution channel for in-house high margin products where theyâ€™ll have a say in price, shelf-space etc.. I think Simpsonâ€™s focus on more value add products like edibles &amp; oils is brilliant because their margins wonâ€™t disappear in the event of over supply (Like in Oregon). Simpson said recently itâ€™s cheaper for them to buy flower on the open market then to produce it due to oversupply. 

Golden Leaf itself will be able to focus on improving their premium brand selection without having to worry about distribution.  They are already in markets like California, Canada, Nevada, Oregon. Once they roll out the franchise systems and the industry matures I believe theyâ€™ll be huge. High end recognized brands with quality products are the future of the mainstream cannabis industry IMO. The US cannabis boom will be 10x the size of Canadaâ€™s. They have the potential to be the Starbucks of cannabis imo.

Always do your own research before listening to a stranger online lol. Iâ€™ve linked everything Iâ€™ve read backing up my opinion. Iâ€™d love some feedback from more seasoned investors.
