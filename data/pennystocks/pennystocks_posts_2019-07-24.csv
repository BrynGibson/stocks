2,TTCM slide,ch4aqx,Bubbs77,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ch4aqx/ttcm_slide/,17,29,"I figured someone would have posted on TTCM by now. 

One of the biggest unwritten rules on OTC is ‚ÄúSell the news‚Äù I‚Äôve learned this the hard way more than once so when I saw that TTCM had app release news on m the App publicly released via google I knew that we would get an early spike and then a sell off. This is nothing different than what Some Of us  had been saying. Long story short I sold the remainder of my position today at .032 and .030. I made a very nice profit and am looking for re-entry. 

   Now... there is still the app release on IOS, more updates to the app, the share buy Back, and the scavenger hunt world record.

   Still plenty of things to move this past a nickel. For now I‚Äôm personally looking for the best re entry point.  To be honest if it‚Äôs not where I want it I‚Äôll keep my money and hang back. But if we get a good enough dip between now and scavenger hunt I‚Äôll buy back in. 

    Know what you own.  Don‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs word including mine. Do your own DD. Know how OTC stocks trade. And watch your play close. 

There‚Äôs still money to be made here and I‚Äôm watching for it.

      Also had a nice celebration party for the money made off this one. Hopefully TTCM does well going forward and more importantly I hope we find the next hottest stock!! 

Good luck to all and keep it green!!!

I‚Äôm fairly new to trading and have been messing with Robinhood for a few months. My first purchase was 34 shares of Weatherford and shortly after I bought it, there were talks about filing for chapter 11 relief. I had a chance to sell for a small profit but I hesitated and hoped it would climb a little higher, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt. So now I‚Äôm stuck with the shares that are at around .034 cents and the chapter 11 is already in motion. For the past couple weeks I have been receiving emails from Robinhood with documents detailing the case. However, I have no idea what any of this means. Today I received an email with a document titled ‚ÄúNotice of Final Order,‚Äù once again, I have no idea what this means. Can anyone help me figure out what the next step is? Or what I should do with the few shares I have? Are there any legal complications I could face for selling, or not selling?",2019-07-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cheger/wftiq_weatherford_chapter_11/
