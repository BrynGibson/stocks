30,born2rock4life,erzo8h1,/r/pennystocks/comments/c4wvd0/hsgx_pending_reversal_on_the_daily_chart_and_may/erzo8h1/,1,"In short, pivot points typically work as a means of support and resistance levels. It doesnâ€™t mean it will go one way or the other, but rather sets the expectations where the market normally clings to at support and resistance levels when it makes those moves. As it makes movements, watch for it to test near those levels when going up and down. It isnâ€™t always right on, as buyers/sellers will put shares just outside the price to increase the likelihood the order fills if it doesnâ€™t quite go to or beyond the intended pivot point.

Todayâ€™s end of day spike in price was a nice short term exit, especially AH when it hit .235 for a nice 20% gain from the earlier daily low.

That said, you have to decide how much and when you want to gain / risk. But 3% gains daily compounds fast. So if you canâ€™t get the same exit as after hours, be patient if youâ€™re willing to ride it out and see if it holds higher support. Otherwise you may have a chance premarket to sell near the same price levels as after hours.  Best of luck, and see you in the morning.",2019-06-24

Sorry?

Iâ€™m *definitely* not an expert here, but would the winter months not cause more issues for some shipping companies when the polar routes refreeze, forcing them to go towards the equator instead? (Companies shipping from the Arctic Circle might have issues if they donâ€™t have ice-breaker class ships, for example.)

The only reason I can think of (And again, I am *not an expert* in this industry) for September being the month to get into shipping (and logistics in general) is because itâ€™s the very beginning of the Halloweâ€™en and Christmas seasons.",2019-06-24
