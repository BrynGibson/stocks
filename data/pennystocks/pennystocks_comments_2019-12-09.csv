I mean,shit, you could pick up a third ownership of the company for about $70k.",2019-12-09
5,Smit_W,fabfic2,/r/pennystocks/comments/e8bdwh/sbes_unreal_volume_can_it_see_pennies/fabfic2/,1,"Anticipation of filings stating confirmation of R/M. Supposedly the company merging into SBES has a $10bn valuation. However, it's a Chinese company and Chinese R/M's are notoriously disingenuous. HOWEVER, again (lol), the company's two key partners pulling this R/M together (Robert Xu and David-Guiping Xu) are credible and have had recent success with two previous R/M's ZMRK and HDII (although, the control in HDII is currently in dispute). 

I've done 12+ hours DD on this one and I can go on forever, but this is a quick rundown.

I'm in this one with 575,000 shares at .0070. This has a rather large following on Twitter.",2019-12-09
6,wright6c,fabfok4,/r/pennystocks/comments/e8bdwh/sbes_unreal_volume_can_it_see_pennies/fabfok4/,1,Yea this is my understanding as well. I think there is still some running left in this one.,2019-12-09
7,Smit_W,fabgvj0,/r/pennystocks/comments/e8bdwh/sbes_unreal_volume_can_it_see_pennies/fabgvj0/,1,"I could definitely see this hitting AT LEAST $0.30. The only problem is the number of outstanding shares is +800,000,000 and the current share float  hasn't been confirmed, so it will take a lot of buying power for this one to move, but based off the fact that today's volume is *just* in anticipation of the news, when the news actually drops (8K report), I can see this pulling a $GRNF. 

Although, be weary because while there is strong reason to believe moves are being made with this R/M, the 8K coming out this week isn't definitive.",2019-12-09

Due diligence--- I called out this stock last week at .20 and made a good chunk since it went to .29 and now I'm looking to double down buying at  .27 to see if I can get on on some hopefully good news.
