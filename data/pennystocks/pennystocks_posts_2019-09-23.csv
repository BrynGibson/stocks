&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Currently, the price of the stock is sitting at $0.002 and since OTCQB requires the issuing company to have a PPS of at least $0.01, analysts are keen to see what the company has to release in terms of news/updates in order to reach the mandatory $0.01 listing requirement. The CEO if IGPK also ruled out a Reverse Split on Friday, with the following statement.

If LTBR is not above $1 for 10 consecutive days by I think the first week of Nov they would be removed from the NASDAQ. At this juncture I think that a R/S is distinctly possible.

THE GOOD NEWS:

The CEO has been saying for some time that a contract is in the final stages. Today, LTBR announced that Enfission (a JV between LTBR and the worlds largest nuclear rod manufacturer Framatome created a few years ago) had successful demonstration of the manufacturing process and fabrication of LTBR Fuel surrogate rods in a length (6ft) that could be usable in NuScale Power's small modular reactors (SMR). SMRs are the hot thing right now, specifically with use in the military as the majority of western casualties in combat zones comes from refuelling.

NuScale signed an MOU not long ago and as mentioned before the JV with Framatome is insane and being seriously overlooked.

The lead test rod contract*, not a full blown contract yet, is expected soon. Likely after the manufacture of a 12ft surrogate rod. The issue is the timeline with NASDAQ but that's an artifical time constraint in terms of business progress. Meaning it doesn't have anything to do with their actual situation, simply their listing. 

How to invest:

-During all previous conference calls the CEO has been sure that a reverse split would not be needed. As time comes close...well that doesn't look so obvious. You could wait until the reverse split and the inevitable drop in price to jump in.

-*If*, and this is a big if, a contract is miraculously signed in the next 3 weeks, the stock would absolutely skyrocket. I believe the odds of this are not zero but not much higher.

Nothing in the nuclear contract world is small. Nothing. Taking a company with no debt, ~21 million in cash, a joint venture with the  worlds largest nuclear fuel manufacturer, and a market cap of $24.8 million and then giving them a contract and a step onto the big the stage would be crazy. Long shot but they keep making progress and taking steps towards profitability.",2019-09-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d88hv4/ltbr/

**BOSTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 23, 2019** **/** [Worlds](http://pr.report/LBxNiOab) Inc. (OTCQB:WDDD), a leading intellectual property developer and licensee of patents related to 3D online virtual worlds, has filed a complaint for patent infringement against Linden Research, Inc., d/b/a Linden Lab, a Delaware corporation based in San Francisco, California. In the complaint, Worlds accuses Linden Lab and its ""Second Life"" product of infringing Worlds' U.S. Patent No. 7,181,690, titled ""System and Method for Enabling Users to Interact in a Virtual Space"" (the ""'690 Patent"").

""We will work diligently to defend Worlds' patent rights,"" said Wayne M. Helge, lead counsel of Worlds' litigation team at [Davidson, Berquist, Jackson &amp; Gowdey](http://pr.report/3eXSuyHE), LLP (DBJG) against Linden Lab. ""Unlike many patents being asserted across the country, the ''690 Patent' has already fended off an adversarial challenge of its validity.""

The '690 Patent's validity was challenged in 2015, in an *inter partes* review petition filed by Bungie, Inc. with the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). More than 18 months later, the '690 Patent emerged from the *inter partes* review process with the asserted claims determined to be patentable by a panel of three judges of the PTAB.

In addition to DBJG, Worlds has the experienced litigation team at [RatnerPrestia](http://pr.report/RzHl7nX9)'s Wilmington, Delaware office, including attorneys Jeffrey B. Bove and Rex A. Donnelly, providing support in its enforcement of its patent rights.

""Our expert legal team at Davidson Berquist successfully defended the '690 Patent before the PTAB, and convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Court (CAFC) to reverse and remand unfavorable PTAB decisions against other Worlds' patents. The CAFC's [ruling](http://pr.report/aCdD3Vg0) instructed the PTAB to reconsider the methods it used to evaluate the relationship between Activision and Bungie, and provided strong guidance on the rules to follow,"" stated Thom Kidrin, Worlds Inc. CEO. ""We await an imminent favorable final outcome from the PTAB in this matter, and look forward to both restarting our already-active litigation against Activision and asserting Worlds' intellectual property rights against other infringers. This litigation against Linden Lab is the first step in that process.

Kidrin noted, ""Our '690 Patent is fundamental to the functionality and success of numerous 3-D, computer-generated, graphical, multi-user, interactive virtual world systems and games that are enjoyed by millions of people globally. While we are excited by the popularity of these games, we want to ensure that we and our shareholders receive just compensation for the system and method we developed that helped make these types of products possible.""",2019-09-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d8alnu/bcci_rltr_worlds_inc_files_patent_infringement/
