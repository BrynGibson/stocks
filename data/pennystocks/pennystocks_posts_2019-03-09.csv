2,Profound Medical Corp.,az0wit,fausthimself,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/az0wit/profound_medical_corp/,4,11,"Profound Medical‚Äôs business is based primarily around two products that incorporate the same particular technology. 

Currently their only one on the market is called Sonalleve, which treats uterine fibroids.

According to webmd.com, ‚Äúas many as 70 to 80% of all women will have fibroids by age 50.‚Äù However most women will not require treatment for this condition. 

Their other product, which is scheduled to be commercially available in 2020, is called the TULSA-PRO, whose principal intent is to treat prostate cancer. 

According to GlobeNewswire‚Äôs article from yesterday, March 7th, Profound Medical is ‚Äúthe only company to provide a therapeutics platform that provides the precision of real-time Magnetic Resonance (‚ÄúMR‚Äù) imaging combined with the safety and ablation power of directional and focused ultrasound technology for the incision-free ablation of diseased tissue.‚Äù So basically they can blast away prostate cancer without cutting your ass open, or however they get in there. 

Selling around 80 cents a share, I think their lack of sales year over year is currently overshadowing their potential growth. Yesterday they released their 2018 full year financial results, and they were down in revenue by -46.9% over last year. But as mentioned above, treatment of uterine fibroids is not all that common, whereas according to health.org, 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and if given the option I‚Äôm sure most men would elect not to get their ass cut up. Profound Medical has signed a strategic collaboration agreement with German conglomerate Siemens  to sell the TULSA-PRO alongside Siemens‚Äô MR scanner, which proves to me that although Profound Medical has a novel technology, it‚Äôs not a gimmick, and it could likely become the preferred way to treat different malignant or benign growths on the body. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this one grow out of the penny stocks. ",2019-03-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/az0wit/profound_medical_corp/

9,Penny Stock Trading Diary - Week 2,az6zds,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/az6zds/penny_stock_trading_diary_week_2/,31,10,"Hey all!

I have been writing a weekly diary of my penny stock trades and the journey including account logs, screenshots and chart breakdowns and analysis and wanted to share it with you. I am currently on week 2 and this subreddit doesn't allow me to share any of the charts or account screenshots or trading logs so I housed them on this forum. It also has the beginning of the journey and Week 1 in the post here: [https://stocktalkcentral.com/d/76-stock-trading-diary](https://stocktalkcentral.com/d/76-stock-trading-diary)

Feel free to let me know your thoughts! I will hopefully be able to post this every week going forward, outlining my journey!  


# Week 2

Second week is complete! This week was a little on the slow side. I entered 3 trades this week, currently still holding 2 out of the 3 as they have not hit my price target or my stop loss yet. I feel pretty comfortable with both hitting next week though. This week with holding 2 of my 3 trades I am up **$80.59**. Good to still be up in back to back weeks, was a little afraid of these 2 plays I'm in taking a while to play out but hopefully both will hit and I can reach that $11,000 mark. Let's check out the trades that I made this week.

These were the tickers I traded for the week of March 4th 2019:

* **NGD**
* **BIOC**
* **SRNE**

As you can see from the log above, another week where the loss I did take was very small. This is very important as there will always be losses in trading but if you can keep those losses small and take advantage of your wins you can consistently be profitable. Also sticking to your stop losses or technical breaks is key, a lot of traders when it gets to that point decide to hold out for a bounce that never happens.

### Trade Highlights

**SRNE** \- This was the only stock I executed a buy and sell on for the week and was pretty disappointing. Although I didn't have a whole lot of money in this trade, I felt very confident in the chart playing out and this being a successful trade. This was a trade I could have easily fallen too in love with and held for a large loss because I really liked the chart setup. In situations like this it is best to try and approach trading as if you are a robot, no emotions no second guessing none of that. Keep it robotic, set an entry price, set a price target and set a stop loss **AND STICK TO IT**. This trade I entered at $2.02 and wanted to see about $2.15 with a stop loss if $1.95 broke. The next day we got a nice bounce up to $2.13, very close to my exit, hindsight is always nice. Then the stock took a drop late in the day and the next day sold off further. Once $1.95 broke I exited the trade and was ready to move on to the next one. Check out the chart below and you can see once that $1.95 level broke this stock fell all the way down to $1.81. When a strong support level breaks you usually see a big sell off on the technical breakdown. This is another reason why you have to do your best to leave emotions out of your trades, had I decided oh well this stock will probably bounce back, I could have taken a bigger loss rather than sticking to my stop and taking a small loss and moving on to the next trade.

**NGD** \- This trade is still ongoing, I entered on Monday at $0.85. Feeling very confident in this one, expecting to be able to exit at $0.90+ on Monday or Tuesday of next week. Gold is currently on the rise a bit as market has been sliding. NGD closed Friday just under $0.89 so already up nicely on this trade. I noticed it had a pretty strong support level in the $0.84-$0.85 level so that's where I jumped in at. My price target was $0.90 and my stop loss was $0.83. So as you can see I essentially was risking 2 cents for a potential reward of 5 cents or more. Always analyze you risk vs. reward on each trade, you want the reward to be greater than the risk. Hopefully I will have a positive update on this one in my next week report.

**BIOC** \- This is the other trade that I am still holding, I also entered this one on Monday at $1.03. I would gauge my level of concern on this trade as mild. I have a stop loss on this stock at $0.97, I felt like the bottom had been re-established at $1.02, that broke at one point this week, I also felt $1.00 was a strong level for this stock too, that level broke temporarily as well this week. Both of those things have me slightly concerned but after both of those breaks the stock bounced right back which is encouraging. My main concern with this trade is the length of time I am holding it, This stock has traded very sideways for several months, but it has had a few nice pops over $1.10. I will be keeping a close eye on this one throughout the week and hopefully get to exit for profit in the $1.08-$1.10 range.

# Key Takeaways

Pretty slow uneventful week, pumped for NGD next week! One thing I keep working on is screening for good setups and maintaining a good risk vs. reward ratio. I really like to trade support/resistance levels as it gives me a clear exit for a stop loss and can give some good price targets based on resistance points. The downside to this is these plays usually are fairly slow and take some time to play out. As you can see with BIOC and NGD. Both were support plays and although NGD is near my price target, it has been a slow mover along with BIOC all week. I may go back and look at a few of my other momentum based strategies that tend to be slightly riskier but can produce quicker gains. I think a nice mix of the two could provide some solid results. I will keep my goal for next week at $11,000. If NGD and BIOC both hit their respective price targets that will put my account over $11,000 and then from there the next goal will be the road to $15,000 over the next couple months.

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey for this week. Hope you keep following and commenting for future weeks. Looking forward to what everyone has to say this week!
