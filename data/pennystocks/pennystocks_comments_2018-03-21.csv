3,inflatable_pickle,dw1ikhc,/r/pennystocks/comments/85z61t/otc_pump_dump_promotions_never_came_back/dw1ikhc/,1,"I’m curious if the pump &amp; dumps stopped working because those particular newsletters stopped finding available customers, or if the actual companies stopped participating. 

My guess is that many of the major players had made enough money, and didn’t want to push it much further, as they are always barely legal. I know there is no concept of “enough”, but if the top 10 guys all became millionaires, and started to push into legitimate investments, then it may die off because it usually relies on many people pumping in coordinated fashion. The S&amp;P was up around 20% in 2017. Literally anyone could make money through passive investments. ",2018-03-21
4,No_Travel_Blog_Here,dw1je2t,/r/pennystocks/comments/85z61t/otc_pump_dump_promotions_never_came_back/dw1je2t/,1,"I worked as a Direct Response Copywriter for a long time creating similar promotions as the ones who did those OTC ones. But instead of overtly saying ""buy this stock!"" they would tease stock picks / stock picking records by gurus and would reveal everything in a ""free report"" when you agree to a trial subscription to the newsletter.

Most of these newsletters weren't penny stock related (although some were like ""Small Cap Millionaire"" or something) and they all had different focuses like natural resources or biotech or crypto and so on. 

And i know that the marketing is always changing. Sometimes something will work and we would milk it for everything it was worth - making $25 million in a matter of weeks on a single promotion. 

Then it would just...STOP. 

But then that same thing - maybe two...three...four years later would work again. 

So what I'm wondering is how long it's been since these big OTC promotions worked and if there may be another ""cycle"" of interest in them again. 

I haven't started day trading yet - but I will.

And because I spent years as a copywriter, I think I have an eye for how these promoters would run their campaigns.

Given the cycle you spoke of, perhaps they will start to return. My theory that a successful stock market bull caused a drop in penny stocks, would mean that a bear market this year could see a return of this scam.

That's the thing - the financial advisories I worked for did not ""pump"" stocks. They sold newsletter advisory subscriptions. They used similar methodology (direct marketing) to sell them, but did not overtly promote stocks. The entire goal was to get people to subscribe to a newsletter. And most of the time the stocks that these newsletters would recommend could not really be pumped. 

They would never - for example - send out a series of emails saying ""Buy this little-known stock [TICKER]"" although they may send out an email like ""This little-known stock could see 1,000% gains!"" Then they'd tease, tease, tease what this stock could be until you just paid $49 for a 60-day trial membership of a financial advisory to receive your ""free"" research report of ""The 1,000% Gains Wall Street Doesn't Want You To Know!"", but the stock they recommend typically isn't going to be something that can actually be pumped. Nor would they have made money on any kind of pump. 

They make money from the subscriptions not the actual stock pumps...etc. 

When I talk about cycles I mean ""angles.""

For example, during the Obama administration, the key demographic of this market (typically Baby Boomer conservatives) were very fearful - they were suspicious of the bull market, they thought it was proppedup nonsense, they were coming off the heels of 2008, they were scared shitless that Hillary may be elected, and so EVERYTHING was fear-based. 

Basically - another collapse is coming, the Obama administration propped up the market, how to protect your money, and so on. 

After Trump got elected there was a collective sigh of relief for this demographic, that's when greed-oriented promos really took off. Stuff promising huge returns, enormous gains for very little investment, ""can't miss"" formulas, systems, done-for-you type stuff. 

Everything kind of moves  in cycles. ",2018-03-21

No one is arguing that heroin and morphine are the same - but they are in the manner that anyone would call antibe's drug and naproxen the same.  Heroin is just  Diacetylmorphine, the 2 acetyl groups break off in your body and they are the same.

FWIW ATE has a fairly broad patent for attaching H2S-releasing moieties to NSAIDs. This covers not just ATB-346 but also applications to ibuprofen, Celebrex etc.

I am sure Big Pharma could figure out some way around thia if they really wanted to, they are very smart and have tons of cash.  Even if they somehow could, they would need to  start the preclinical and clinical trial process for their new drug from scratch. Plus probably file their own slightly different patent. At this point for the cost and resource/time effort it would be much easier to just buy ATE for half a billion dollars and get the company that already has patents and several years head start. 

And even if Big Pharma really wanted their own 346-knockoff, 346 would still get approved first and Big Pharma wpuld need their drug to show marked improvement in either safery or efficacy or both (similar to what 346 is now doing to Naproxen).

Secondly, it takes a lot to start a biotechnology company, expertise, staff, a pipeline of a unique drug.  Now, you have to go through several stages to get to where ATE is today.  1. Test on animals, they used rats and be successful.  2. Phase 1 testing on healthy adults.  Not an easy task since your testing on humans, difficult to obtain.  Most are unsuccessful.  Phase 2. Phase II trials are used to get an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of patients, ATE had two sub-phases, double blind study against competitor. Phase 2 just completed and the results were outstanding on ~ 240ish people.  The ATE ATB-346 drug is superior to ""Aleve"" or the Generic Naproxen.  Phase 3 is an expanded human trial, mostly to see how it interacts with up to 3000 people to see if any complications may exist with other drugs combined etc.  about 1/3 drugs that make it to Phase 2b make it this far.  The success rate to make it to Phase 2 is not even 10%.   So in short, no it won't fall that far, as people will pick up shares, or it definitely will be bought out that cheap as now there is valuable IP.  Lastly, people are dumping shares as it will be some time before Phase 3 results are known, Q4 or longer.  So share price might go up, down, stay the same.  In terms of penny stocks, this is a company with validated IP to challenge $8B industry.
