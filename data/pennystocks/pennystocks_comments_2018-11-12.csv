9,Finarel,e9jrs4c,/r/pennystocks/comments/9w9j2p/what_are_the_best_stocks_to_buy_on_11122018/e9jrs4c/,1,"Depends on your strategy. Do you have a long term outlook? Do you want to make your money this very same day?

If you are a long term investor, well I would be extremely wary of ALL penny stocks, as most of them are scams.

If  you want to make your money this very same day, I would suggest you look for stocks that have a lot of volume.  If you have the technical knowledge, they are easier to trade, and make money from.

There is a stock I hold very dear because the company behind it is doing really well even though the stock is not doing so great at the moment. AMFE.

AMFE is great because first of all, it is a legit company, that is actually doing money and in the process of expanding. They are the owners of Snakes&amp;Lattes which is a board game caf√©. S&amp;L owns 4 locations (brick and mortar / Physical): 3 in Toronto and 1 that recently opened in Tempe AZ. 

They recently got audited for the past 2 years, but because they were working on the audits, they could not release the audited 10k in time, which is why they have the STOP sign. 

Once they do file that information, they will uplist from the PINk sheets to the OTCQB, and there are plenty of catalysts coming, including a dividend from a spin off which is being prepared.

All this information can be found in OTCmarkets.com

They are also an MJ play, hopefully that will bring some excitement to the stock once the STOP sign is removed.",2018-11-12
