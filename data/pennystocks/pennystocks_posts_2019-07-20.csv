0,Might you be intrested in LBSR,cfifu8,Zakkat02,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cfifu8/might_you_be_intrested_in_lbsr/,0,6,"LBSR is a mining company in arizona. There name is Liberty Star Uranium Company however they no longer are looking for uranium as they lost the claims that contained uranium almost a decade ago probably. They are currently in the process of changing there name to Liberty Staf Minerals (LSM) but dont have the money quite yet because they are in the process of trying to save every penny to keep the lights on. 

I know that sounds bad but hear me out. 

The area that LBSR has have a huuuuuge deposit of rare earth minerals and thats been verified by outside sources as well. (They have an SRK report that backs there claims is what I'm referencing)  There former CEO and founder (who still works for the company) is a very very experienced geologist. 

Things have been slow moving for the company this last decade but they are sitting on a literal gold mine. The reason they aren't successful yet is because they are currently waiting for a drilling partner/joint venture to fund their project.

There are usually some- not huge- but medium sized gaps in there news lately hence the slow moving part I said earlier but theres been quite a bit of silence right now so I'm hopeful for something soon (as I have been for a while). Supposeably they have been having ongoing conversations with multiple potential drilling partners. 

The stock earlier this year traded at .0003 and is now bouncing at around .0012-.0015. Right now it's at  
.0015 so as someone who looks at the stock everyday I'd wait until it hits .0012 or even .0011 again to buy in if you think the risk might be worth the reward after doing some DD. I personally do think it's worth the risk. Here's a few reasons why:

1. Members of the board at LBSR recently loaned money to the company out of there own pocket which would be an interesting move if the stock was dying. This makes me believe they must think something is around the corner

2. The SRK report verified everything they say which means they are sitting on a lot of money

3. The company seems to have a strategy despite tough times...recently they reduced monthly costs but 8,000$ (probably more now). Now all the only card left in there deck is to discuss drilling with others which would give a definate price bump if successful. 

4. The amount of experience just in there lead scientific adviser (the founder and former CEO I mentioned earlier) is unreal let alone the whole teams skillset

Welp that's my opinion and theres some information about one of my favorite penny stocks I've been following since 2011. Disclaimer I'm about as biased as it gets. I highly recommend some dd for this stock before you knock it just because I think a majority of waiting for something to bump up the stock price is over and I believe in the reward over the risk.
