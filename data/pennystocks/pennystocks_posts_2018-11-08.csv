2/. ***Improved Revenue*** for the third quarter as compared with the first two quarters of 2018 and also an increase over the nine month period ended September 30, 2017.

Orie Rechtman, CEO of Crednology commented: “We had a much stronger third quarter with improved revenues and EBITDA. I am very pleased with our progress in this third quarter and look forward to continuing our upward trend in both Revenue and EBITDA.”

Orie Continued: “I made the decision to loan enough funds to the Company to pay off the existing SBA loan. This new loan reduces the monthly payment by almost $2,000 per month thereby improving the Company’s cash flow. The lower interest charge on this new loan will help to improve EBITDA and as a result drive up ***Shareholder Value***. We continue to look for growth opportunities and will keep Shareholders informed as to our progress.

**Partnership will Expand Reach of Major Hemp H-IPA Throughout Nation’s Third Largest Craft Beer Market**

COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE – Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in technology, manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, announces it has signed a definitive distribution agreement with Wein-Bauer, Inc. to distribute the newly launched premium craft beer Major Hemp H-IPA.  

Wein-Bauer, Inc. operates with a primary distribution center just outside of Chicago and boasts regional offices on both coasts, including partnerships with brokers in key states which will enable Major Hemp H-IPA to expand nationally.  The two companies are currently working together to fine tune distribution and marketing strategies.  Sales will officially commence next week.

The greater Chicago area is home to over 150 breweries, several thousand bars and restaurants, and the nation’s third largest population.  Due to its centralized location and strong reputation for beer drinking, Sipp Industries and distribution partner Wein-Bauer expect Major Hemp H-IPA to be a popular favorite in Chicago and throughout the Midwest region.

Sipp Industries officially launched Major Hemp H-IPA last week with its brewing partner, Church Street Brewing Company, in Itasca, IL.  It was a tremendous success as the company reported selling over 5 kegs and 400 cans during the initial launch event.  The feedback from patrons sampling Major Hemp H-IPA was overwhelmingly positive and the company is excited about bringing the premium hemp beer to the mass markets, as it now sets its sights on immediately penetrating the enormous craft beer market in the greater Chicago area.

Ted Jorgensen, President of Major Hemp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sipp Industries, stated, “We are thrilled to partner with Wein-Bauer, Inc. to distribute Major Hemp H-IPA.  They have numerous key relationships with large, well-known retailers, restaurants, pubs and establishments where our hemp beer will be a perfect fit.”

Sipp Industries plans to hire a new Sales Director that will cover the Midwest region and work closely with the Wein-Bauer team, providing tastings and samplings of Major Hemp H-IPA.  The company is also making preparations for a second run of Major Hemp H-IPA to ensure inventory keeps up with demand.

**About Sipp Industries, Inc.**

Sipp Industries is a multifaceted corporation that specializes in technology, manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Major Hemp, the Company provides hemp beer, high quality and competitively priced hemp-based products, bulk hemp, CBD supply, co-packing and private labeling services.

Medicinal Marijuana Continues Strong Growth Behind Advanced CBD Applications and Uses
November 8, 2018

Palm Beach, FL – (November 8, 2018) – The cannabis sector as a whole is currently in the midst of a boom with the recent positive news of full legalization in Canada, but the medicinal sector of the market is also doing exceptionally well as companies develop new products leveraging CBD. The healthcare market has seen an uptick in consumers searching for alternative medicines, and cannabis has positioned itself very well to take advantage of this new demand. Leaders in the industry are expanding their market reach with new products and effective marketing campaigns in various states where medicinal cannabis is legal. Additionally, the loophole of CBD’s ambiguity when it comes to legality has allowed companies to tap into markets where Cannabis is otherwise unavailable. The global medical cannabis market is expected to top $20 billion by 2025, according to data from Coherent Market Insights.   Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), MariMed Inc. (OTC:MRMD), Aphria Inc. (NYSE:APHA) (TSX:APHA), Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NYSE:ACB) (TSX:ACB), India Globalization Capial Inc. (OTC:IGCC).

Leafywell (Leafywell.com), a subsidiary of PYTG (OTC: “PYTG”), handles the production, manufacturing, and distribution of hemp-based Cannabidiol (CBD) products such as tinctures, creams, lotions, edible candies, at both the wholesale and retail level.

Dr. Canasi, when asked, “How do you view the role of CBD in medical treatment plans?”, Dr. Canasi responded candidly, “I appreciate all types of medicine that help patients achieve their treatment goals and we are fortunate to live in a world in which we have options, healthy options. I am a strong advocate of incorporating CBD into a treatment, when appropriate, and in some cases, it is used as a stand-alone treatment and in others I suggest to my patients a mix of CBD along with a regimen of medicinal marijuana or other medicines. CBD can be incorporated to manage a selection of types of pain, including chronic pain.”

Dr. Canasi’s medical practice offers for purchase a selection of Leafywell (Leafywell.com) products.
