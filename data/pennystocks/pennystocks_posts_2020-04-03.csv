The only reason this company isnt big news is because of big pharma keeping it down.

I have a vested position in this stock but I truly believe it will moon for real in the future. It went down yesterday for no apparent reason....but I'm buying the dip. It held 3 dollars all week and suddenly dropped to 2.25ish. 

I've heard rumors of offerings. Even if its true, it's a tiny company that needs the money. This isnt AYTU. There is a legitimate product being tested right now and used.n",2020-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fu22c1/cydy/

52,Robinhood Day Trade Limit for Volatile Penny Stocks,fude7o,GeneticJD,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fude7o/robinhood_day_trade_limit_for_volatile_penny/,1,2,"Hi.

Sorry if this isn't the right reddit for this question, but I am looking for someone that is familiar with the day trading limit on Robinhood.

I am not marked as a pattern day trader and I don't have a portfolio greater than $25,000, but I do typically use all 3 of my Day Trades within a 5 Day Trading Period. 

With that being said, Robinhood also has this box that shows Margin Health and Day Trade Buying Limits. Does anybody know why mine is negative? Also, is this box only directed at people that buy on margin. For what it's worth, I do **NOT** have margin trading turned on because I don't want to borrow money from Robinhood.

&amp;#x200B;

| Margin Health |GOOD |
|:-|:-|
|Volatility|Low|
|**Today’s Day Trade Limit**|\-$3,675.00|

I guess my question is - Does this box only affect margin day traders? Or could a non-pattern &amp; non-margin day trader also be subject to these day trade buying power limits. The Robinhood help section wasn't very helpful on this, it was somewhat unclear and didn't specify if it was directed at pattern day traders, margin traders, or everyone. 

I held shares of Inovio overnight and sold this morning, but my day trade buying power is still negative. If I attempt to buy new stocks, I don't receive any warnings about day trade limits or day trade calls. 

Very confusing. Thanks for any help that you can provide.",2020-04-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fude7o/robinhood_day_trade_limit_for_volatile_penny/
