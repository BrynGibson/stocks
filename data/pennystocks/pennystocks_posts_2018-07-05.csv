I have been following this stock for a while based mostly on who the two lead investors are:  Frank Guistra and Eric Sprott.

Do you guys have any thoughts on this one?  It is up 15 percent or so today and looks like it might take off - also they think they may have found the 'motherlode' in the Klondike.  Ha.  But what if?

Anyhow - thanks for any replies in advance...",2018-07-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8w7i10/klondike_gold_tsxv_kg/

Martin Luther King III considers internet user rights to be an important part of human rights. On July 4th he took to social media, including Twitter and Facebook, to advocate for users and to share his support for [meggalife.com](http://pr.report/q3BrVvcF), a new social internet platform by EF Hutton that offers users [compensation ](http://pr.report/nKUcRYlt)for their use of apps like [social networking](http://pr.report/m0LYc84n) and communication services.

""I have joined [meggamigo.com](http://pr.report/7rJUhoFZ) and [meggabuzz.com](http://pr.report/LhUxj6oV), which are part of an easy to use social internet platform [meggalife.com](http://pr.report/6OMoW8iZ) \- a creative initiative that enables users to be compensated for using the social internet,"" King tweeted. Following in the footsteps of his parents, King is an internationally recognized human rights activist who supports the need for [user rights](http://pr.report/E2AIQhMm) action.

Speaking at the EF Hutton Talks Conference on User Rights on June 25th King told the crowd, ""User rights is a cause of critical urgency in the 21st century. I certainly believe that while user rights is an issue that has been discussed for a little bit of time, there is a larger opportunity to really begin the process of educating the community about user rights."" A one-minute synopsis of his speech is available online at the EF Hutton Talks Conference Series YouTube channel.

""In a real sense, perhaps the public has been exploited as often happens through some business opportunity,"" King added. ""But, I believe that when people understand their opportunity digitally they will see the importance of this issue because we all use this creature called the Internet.""

King is asking for all of his followers to join him in spreading the word about this new frontier in socioeconomic injustice by liking and sharing his posts. Follow Mr. King on Twitter @OfficialMLK3, [meggabuzz.com](http://pr.report/mkO0yXWo) and on Facebook @MartinLutherKingIII
