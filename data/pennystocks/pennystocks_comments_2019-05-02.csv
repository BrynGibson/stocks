They have patents waiting approval in the US, they got approved for expedited patenting (avg under 6 months from filing), and the patents are approved in Canada. Their machine tests THC, CBD, heavy metals, insecticides and they are remodeling it for roadside drug testing. The machine is listed and proven to be effective in parts per billion (everything else proven to work measures in ppm). They have biomarking technology that is in beta testing, biomarking the plants DNA tracking it seed to sail (all governments want this).

Oh, this earnings coming up is the first with sales. The preliminary run was for 50 machines, and growers demanded more, so they started with 80. 60 confirmed sold. a batch of 200 is supposed to be complete by then as well. Each machine cost &lt;$20000, takes under 8 min to test and has one time use testing cartridges for ~$65. They also recently won some awards for their product. Worth holding a year, but keep a close eye on it. you might want to hold for longer or shorter... it is still a penny stock. This one will not double over night.
