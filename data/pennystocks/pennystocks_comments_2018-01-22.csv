I'm not saying BPX-01 isn't going to be an improvement on the drug but I do want to point out their development is in phase 2 so research should be taken with a grain of salt. I can't find their research so I can't comment directly but generally these can be small trials, non-randomized. Basically helps the company decide to move further down the pipeline but nothing concrete we can say about it. That being said we know minocycline works so maybe that adds something. Next question - is anyone else beating them in the pipeline? Phase 2 trials just determine if the intervention works, next they have to compare it to the current standard intervention to see if it's as good or better. Quick search shows another company, foamix, is already in phase 3 for a mino foam. Just some thoughts, I'll be adding them to my watch list so thanks for posting.",2018-01-22

In other words it reduces acne but no data showing reduction to clear or almost clear. It'll be interesting to see where they end up with BPX-01. BPX-04 sounds more interesting though honestly.

51,lmnfaggot,dt3ovk0,/r/pennystocks/comments/7s7h3n/icld_boom_or_bust/dt3ovk0/,1,"ICLD is prime to have a several hundred to thousand % pump with the exception of an RS being enacted.  Back in December they announced intention for a big RS however last time this happened it took them a year to enact the split due to FINRA having to sing off on it.  That split caused 90%+ losses for any long.  The reason for the potential pump is that the dilution from the previous RS is almost at maximum allowed shares.  Once it is maxed out investors will return and it will fly.  ICLD is having a bit more attractive balance sheet as compared to 1 - 2 years ago.  I suspect once allowed shares are maxed they will dump some good news as they have been very quiet lately.  Most ICLD investors I know are hoping for it to go to at least 0.02 -0.03.  There's a few dreamers hoping for 0.10.  Check http://otce.finra.org/DailyList every day for ICLD.  If you see a RS listed then sell and run away as fast as you can.  If no RS happens and they show some revenue from their new project netlayer.io then that could really lead to huge gains.  Investors were hoping for contracts relating to the Houston Hurricane but so far no news.  Additionally ICLD received a Wells Notice recently.  Usually that is bad news however if FINRA doesn't allow the RS to enact because of Wells notice then the stock price will shoot up nicely.  

TDLR:  IMO ICLD will have crazy gains within a few weeks unless they perform a possible RS.  If RS then sell and run ASAP and then wait till that dillution is almost maxed.  If you buy check http://otce.finra.org/DailyList for ICLD RS every day to know it's time to get out. ",2018-01-22

80,EroEroOyaji,dt7jbpm,/r/pennystocks/comments/7s89aw/bpmx_biopharmx_their_products_and_possible_long/dt7jbpm/,1,"&gt; how much of an opportunity is this? Could we see BPX-01 on shelves in pharmacies around the country? Granted, anything can happen, but also, what if they could succeed here? What would that mean for the market cap/share price?

I've been buying and selling this for about a week now. I started with $1k USD and now up to $1450 USD so going to reinvest and hope it will double me when the news drop on the conference call

I haven't done stocks in almost 10 years, used to do a little investing for fun and made a couple hundred dollars. Nothing too serious, but want to get back into it so I just bought 700 shares.

My portfolio with ICLD in it fell 65% the day the RS was announced. Does this mean there will be no more progress with this stock? I'm staying in for the long haul. ",2018-01-22
85,lmnfaggot,duty63m,/r/pennystocks/comments/7s7h3n/icld_boom_or_bust/duty63m/,1,"This is tricky.  The 1:100 RS is your shares divided by 100.  Assuming they don't dilute then they are worth the same value as before.  I slept through the RS announcement and I woke up 10 minutes before the closing bell.  I was able to sell 200,000 shares with 90,500 (905 post split) remaining before the bell closed.  Friday morning I was going to buy back in because most people had their shares locked up so they couldn't trade.  I got caught on the phone and missed my opportunity to gain %120 back.  I'm not sure what is going to happen Monday.  If ICLD has major diluting from convertibles then the rest of my shares will be shit.  If no dilution than if I see it up %50+ I'm selling the rest.  There might be a long play at some point but I'm trying to rescue every $ I can at this point.  I'll be looking for dilution to happen and when it is over I'll by back in with whatever I have left from this bloodbath.  I hope to see wild swings Monday and I will pull the trigger on anything that makes up some ground.  I knew I should have sold a couple weeks ago when it was up %100 but I got greedy.
