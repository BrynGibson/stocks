5,sliight,flilmur,/r/pennystocks/comments/fp1sqi/lost_investments/flilmur/,2,"There's two things you can do if you don't want to constantly go broke for the rest of your life.  Definitely accept that you'll never recover the money you've lost throughout your life, and that anytime you gamble you're guaranteed to lose. This presumably you've proven to be true thus far... If that's the case, go in knowing it's impossible to win.

Now, the two options I'd advise. 100% never do anything in a casino, sports bet, or any short term stock investment again... Only long term retirement gainers you won't touch for ten plus years. Dividends reinvested..

Second option: determine what your gamble bankroll is that you can safely lose (once you recover and get some money again for the umpteenth time). Let's say it's $1,000. You're only ever allowed to gamble 10% of your bankroll. So initially $100. Lose say $50 on your bet and you're down to $950. Next gamble capped at $95... This protects you from your always losing everything in the end... Yet if you get hot or make smart choices vs impulsive then you can keep betting more.

If you do want to gamble penny, find them from scratch on your own. Make a database, set up news triggers. When you find that one that may be rolling out something new without big news, throw your 10% at it.

That 10% thing isn't the best risk reward strategy, and it's actually from my years of poker before I got really bored. I used to kill tournaments consistently, but would piss away money in live games since I could get bored and be impatient/impulsive...

Good luck sorting out this mistake and battling through corona with your business. If you didn't kill credit yet look for balance transfer cards to get zero percent rates and crush those balances asap once business making money again...",2020-03-26

I listened to the investor meeting and the price pretty much started dropping sharply during it when it was evident that they weren't going to come out with any special news anytime soon.

A couple of notable things was that the the guy said TNXP wasn't the only one who had meeting with WHO but one of companies.

Another was that he said the vaccine would be mainly for the healthy people.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it will be some time before the human trial.

They recently announced that they will be making covid-19 testing kits.

They project 525 million units sold in the first twelve months. Meeting those projections will be quite the task.

200,000 will be released to hospitals and such by Summer. Later, they will be providing at home testing kits.

After they announced those projections, they announced that they had taken on a $13,000,000 loan to aid in production of said tests.

According to their website, they're also hiring sales people.

The stock is very volatile, it goes up, and it goes down. Today it went down. This was not the result of any bad news. My guess would be it was just day traders selling for profits, panic sellers, and limit loss settings. This can be gut wrenching.

Some people are now playing inverse etfs x3 for some quick bucks given the volatility. Eg. SQQQ, TQQQ.. I personally do not like jnug and jdst (direxion ones) as they decay pretty badly and direxion seems to like doing rs and changeing the mutiplication to benefit themselves (eg from 3 to 2.5/2).

If you want to play options, be careful about them as well. It is not that straightforward as claimed by some folks.. There is IV and beta etc to consider and a lot of people lose a lot of money on them as well.

Press on IBIO is bad.  Find me a good article from a reputable site.

AYTU's stock is contingent upon ordering more test kits, and finding buyers for those test kits.  Even as the pandemic slows, there will be more need for as much testing as possible.  None of the tests are perfect.  AYTU's supposedly needs incubation, but is fast.  Other tests are expensive and take a long time.  Some are tied to large machines hospitals have installed.  There's plenty of room for these in this unique market.

AYTU has high price targets, and some good press.  They also have institutional investors and hedge funds of note on their side.  I haven't really checked IBIO, but nothing is compelling about them to me.

Could AYTU tank, or fare poorly?  Absolutely.  Their prospectus is very clear about the risks involved.  They just dumped a bunch of shares, but I think (complete speculation on my part), that a large order of millions of kits could blow up this stock to the next levels.

Demonstrated efficacy against another human coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus. Such pathogens are often unavailable commercially for laboratory testing.
