I try to buy in at $1 and ride it up to $1.20 or so, sell some and buy back in when it drops.  With the middle east heating up, the days of $1 are long gone until the shooting w/ Iran stops, which I don't see happening any time soon.  My guess is DNR opens at $1.90 tomorrow, drops after the open and maybe ends the day around $1.80-$1.90.  Then it all depends on what Trump or Iran does.  More shooting and DNR goes above $2.   I'm betting on more shooting.   If we go after their refineries or Iran goes after oil tankers, it could go much much higher.

Even reputable companies that fall down to penny stock levels can be really hard to time. Their swings sometimes make no sense. IE bankruptcy news leads to a spike, great news for the bottom line and it plunges. Shit is nonsensical.

You're going to have to figure out what kind of investments you want to make and what type of investor you are. You say high risk high reward and that sounds like swing trading and timing the market.

That's still risky. But when you know what you're willing to risk you'll know where to look. It takes time to figure out. Stick to paper trading for now and just keep digesting info. Youtube, online, ECT...

Those that did well may have a bad losing streak the next month.

Reading stagnant sub-penny candles won’t help you predict a spike, especially if the company is a pump-and-dump and you don’t even know it. Do all your DD about the Leadership, revenues, history, SEC filings, public relations, customer base and future contracts. Some future stock explosions even have their own online communities, you just need to find them. If all of these seem promising and legit: congratulations! You just found the diamond in the rough. Buy and hold. Check the price every day, and constantly update the news about that company. Become an active shareholder and communicate with the company. 

If you can’t find the information I described about the company and it doesn’t look rock-solid, stay the fuck away. A lot of penny stocks are artificial pump and dumps orchestrated by the company to make money off gullible investors that can’t secure profits. Illegal, but it happens nevertheless.

It's illegal. The difficulty is that many times the people pumping are located in foreign jurisdictions that are outside the scope of the SEC or other authorities that regulate these types of schemes.

Essentially, someone is either the original issuer or an early investor.

Let's say you buy 100,000 shares of a stock, SCAM, at .01. You either convince other people to invest or continuing buying more shares of SCAM.  The stock goes up to .05 a share. 


You post all over online forums about your stock, ""SCAM has jumped 500% since I invested! Get in now before it goes the moon without you!"" 

People start investing, and the stock goes to .10 per share. At this point you liquidate your full investment and take your 10x profits. Meanwhile, the stock has no further interest on the market and starts to drop back down. People who bought in at .10 start selling at .08 or .07 and help further push the stock back down until it drops below the .01 you originally started at.

TLDR; First you pumped, then you dumped all over the suckers who believed you.",2020-01-08
