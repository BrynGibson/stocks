3,OPGN DD for free.,fmfo4o,ohiamaude,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fmfo4o/opgn_dd_for_free/,1,32,"OoGen is a nano cap bio with some very near term catalysts with PTs ranging from 100% to 1000%.

OpGen is merging with the German company Curetis on 3/30. Curetis has CV-19 test kits approved in China and Europe.

OpGen is NOT just a CV stock however. If you look at my past posts, I've been in this company before CV was on the radar and making good money. Both companies have pending FDA clearances that could come anytime.

OpGen has Acuita: https://www.opgen.com/acuitas-tests/

Curetis has Unyvero: https://curetis.com/products/unyvero-a50-system/

Both of these products are game changers and will be generating revenue for the newco long after CV.

OpGen has earnings report on Tuesday 3/24, and will be providing a general business update. This could include merger news and possibly FDA update.

It is my opinion that anywhere between $2-$3 is a good entry leading up to earnings (3/24) and merger (3/30). 

I am long in this position but have also daytraded it. I'm not an expert, a doctor, nor did I stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night. This market is volatile so invest accordingly and always do your own DD.",2020-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fmfo4o/opgn_dd_for_free/

10,DECN vs TOMDF,fm84jf,Nice-Location,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fm84jf/decn_vs_tomdf/,1,11,"So I have an interesting question....I was reading up on Todos Medical (Tomdf) and they said they once FDA approval is given they will be able to produce 300,000 test kits a day from China. 

While DECN has said they only have 200,000 test kits planned to go out by May. 

So wouldn't this make TOMDF the stronger play? Since they can produce WAY more test kits for Coronavirus. 

Or does a stock going up or down depend more on news then actual results?? 

I have 1300 shares in each company, but idk. It seems like TOMDF is the stronger play.",2020-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fm84jf/decn_vs_tomdf/

We are academic researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and would like to invite you to **participate in our research study in return for scientifically valid personality feedback.**

In the last few decades, psychologists have rigorously developed empirical tests that assess the core aspects of personality. **You will receive scientifically valid feedback about your personality after taking this short survey (less than 5 minutes).** The feedback will be customized to your responses using the scores of thousands of people who have participated so far.

The test is non-commercial, entirely free, and as anonymous as possible. And, you will have our gratitude—this research is not possible without the help of people like you!

\*As a quick aside, we know that there are communities for survey-takers (e.g., [r/SampleSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/)); however, sampling only groups that are designed for survey-takers would introduce sampling bias and threaten the validity of any results.

15,Simple trading strategy. This is how it's meant to be traded.,fml8fz,Jimmy_bags,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fml8fz/simple_trading_strategy_this_is_how_its_meant_to/,1,104,"Okay, no one cares to divulge any trading strategy that makes them money in fear someone will mess it up for them.  Theoretically me telling people this would benefit everyone including companies that are being traded.  Firstly find a honey hole in the market stock, maybe a few.  Use a screener such as finviz.  Find the below--

- priced $1 or less
- avg. volume between 200k and 400k 
- volatility medium to high
-market cap under 10 mil 
(reason is if market cap is too high chances are they have way too many outstanding shares and the market swings normally dont work in your favor) 

Get the list of stocks that meet this criteria.. now heres the important part. look at the history and see how much it normally drops and gains in the last 2 months or so.   Now WATCH add these stocks to your robinhood list and just watch them.  

When you think you know its lowest, take all the money your willing to invest in the stock now take about 1/6th of that and use that to purchase shares.  Now wait... of course itll drop bc that's your luck, now take another 1/6th and lower your average.. of course itll drop bc that's your luck, now take another 1/6th and buy more to lower your average.  

-buy like this through out  the day, with any luck you'll still have 1/6 or even 2/6 of y ok or cash left over.  

-next day at open chances are itll be up and you lowering your average paid off and you can sell.

- if next day drops more buy more and use your best judgment.  You'll profit sooner than later.  

ONLY RULE IS DO NOT CATCH A FALLING KNIFE! Some sectors have a reputation of falling more and more until you lose it all and it seems like never to get to the price you bought it for.  

The key is to watch, watch, watch. Theoretically this strategy works for ALL stock but not everyone has that kind of money to throw at a stock. So Pennies is what I play with.  So far this has never failed me. Key is to make sure you still have cash to average down and WATCH.  

I know there may be a few ppl reading saying ""yeah then you lose it all trying to catch a falling knife""  no, you didnt understand the WATCH portion of the DD.

19,Some Advice?,fmjh6m,masterumm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fmjh6m/some_advice/,1,16,"Hi guys,

I’ve just been trading for about a week now. Made some wins but also made some losses along the way but I was wondering if anyone can advise on some questions I have:

1. I’m on IBKR (I know, it’s not the best but I live outside the states and this seems to be a good alternative) currently and so far the experience has been fairly positive. However, I realised there are certain things I cannot buy/sell such as JNUG which prompts the message “Contract is not available for trading” - is there a reason behind this?
2. Still trying to understand how stop-sell orders work. From what I know, it automatically sells your order the moment it reaches the stop price. I’d tried it once when the average price I bought in was $1.1 and I made a stop-sell order of $1. It did hit $1 and lingered for quite a while but it just didn’t go through. Did I do something wrong? I notice in IBKR that there is a Attached Order Details field as well which I can select a Stop Loss - what is the difference?
3. I bought 1k shares averaging at 2.3225 of a certain stock awhile back and then bought another 500 at 1.58 average. This would mean my average price is 2.08 for 1.5k shares. I had sold that 500 at 1.6 which I would assume my average price would be back up to about 2.3-ish. However, I still see the average price at 2.08. Is this a mistake? Reason I’m asking is because the app says I need to sell at an average price of 2.08 to break even in terms of unrealised P/L but I’ve already sold off the 500 at only a mere profit of 0.02/share - so that average price to break even now shouldn’t still be at 2.08, isn’t it?
4. Last question - I’ve heard people saying stocks are super volatile especially in times like this with the virus going on. When this subsides and the world is back to normal, will the stock market see the same volatility that can see shares rising over 100% which seems to be quite frequent these days?

Sorry for all the rambling but grateful for any help! :)",2020-03-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fmjh6m/some_advice/
