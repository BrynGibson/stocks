As much as I despise him and he is a total douchebag I felt the need I need to pay for Tim alerts just to see if he is a scam or not and if you know how to trade his “alerts” which are more of a watchlist is actually very good. I do fully believe though that Tim and his other “gurus” and “millionaire students” all get in on the stocks he puts on his watchlist a week + in advanced. Then he adds them to Tim alerts. The people who read it and can get in fast enough will profit the rest get dumped on. Also I cannot speak on his trading courses but idk why anyone would pay for trading courses to begin with.

Tldr - it’s a large scale pump and dump scheme but you can profit from it if you pay close attention and already know how to trade. Guys still a giant douche",2018-09-19

Tim Sykes is a great trader and a horrible teacher. Scan for stocks using biggest % gainers with at least $500,000 worth of stock traded per day. Buy breakouts, short pump and dumps...there I just saved you $5,000. He teaches nothing of risk management, trade management ,or trading psychology...all of which are extremely important in becoming a successful trader. My advice  to you if you're looking to learn how to successfully trade for a living is to read as many trading books as you possibly can. Look up Van Tharp, Michael Covel, and Brian Shannon to start, from there you'll find plenty of others. Make sure to utilize YouTube as well. Most importantly when you do start trading with real money, trade small and learn the difference between good trades and bad. All trades that make money aren't good and all losing trades aren't bad. Consistently make good trades and the money will follow...good luck.",2018-09-19

E trade is out of shares to even sell to their clients, this thing is huge and were 2 weeks away from the court date, imagine how much people who hold until the ruling are going to be rewarded.

My problem with it is, its a delinquent SEC reporter, with a share structure that can’t be verified or confirmed since 2015.
