What I've learned is outperformers had an internal locus of control. They were independent ruminators. They make their own decisions and take responsibility for what, when and how much to enter and exit. This is how they developed a credence system that would translate into a trading system executed through a habit system.

A 3rd party report is coming out within the week and should see a price correction from the .015 itâ€™s at now. Strong company that should only see gains from here.


Last PR from last week... AWESOME NEWS: 

Exxe Group Announces Substantial Quarterly Revenue and Asset Growth 
Press Release | 08/22/2019 

NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exxe Group (OTC PINK: AXXA), a diversified company focused on synergistic acquisitions in real estate, sustainable technology, media, financial services and agriculture, announced today strong year-over-year, quarterly financial results for the period ended June 30, 2019. 

Revenue grew by over 240% to $1.2 million as compared with $348,439 for the same period last year. The growth in revenue was diverse and across multiple holdings, led by sales and income generated by its new real estate, mortgage, industrial and agriculture holdings. Given the strength across the spectrum, management is very encouraged regarding future revenue growth performance in the second half of the year. Moreover, the integration of the recently closed transactions should begin to drive our cross-holding growth. 

Shareholderâ€™s equity rose to $80.3 million versus $37.8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2019, an impressive 110% increase. This figure is a key measure that demonstrates that the companyâ€™s aggressive, targeted acquisition and operations strategy is succeeding. Investors should expect a series of new Letters of Intent to be announced prior to the end of the current quarter. Once closed, these transactions will further increase our reach and financial performance. 

Separately, now that we have filed our quarterly report, an independent research report commissioned by the company providing a review and assessment of current and future valuations for the company will be released before month-end. 

About Exxe Group 
Exxe Group is a diversified corporation focusing on acquisitions in the following sectors: real estate, technology, media, and financial services. Exxe Group is an acquisition-driven company. The Company strategy is to acquire controlling equity interests in undervalued companies and undertake an active role in improving their performance - accelerating their growth by providing both access to capital and management expertise.

18,Your common questions answered!,cy0qpj,21421195211212,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cy0qpj/your_common_questions_answered/,0,31,"**How long have you been trading?**

I've traded since 2013. I paper traded for the first 2 years, then transitioned into real trading.

**What kinds of stocks do you trade?**

Micro - Small cap companies that are up on the day; typically, it's a company that has weak fundamentals.

**How many hours does it take to become a profitable trader?**

Varies. Usually no less than 5000 hours.

**""I want to learn how to trade, where should I start?""**

Start with the basics - understand common terminology. Then, think about what kind of a person you are and determine what kind of trading style you'd be interested in pursuing. (Risk taker, careful, patient, not patient, etc)

**How much money do I need to daytrade?**

Depends. I'd say $5000 is the smallest amount you should ever consider trading with.

**What kind of person shouldn't trade?**

Someone with a lot to lose, and is afraid of losing. Losing will take you out of the game, so you need to truly love it whether you're making money or not.

**How hard is daytrading?**

One of the most difficult things you'll ever try. Be prepared for the lowest lows you've ever felt, and if you pursue hard enough, the highest highs you've ever felt.

**Papertrading?**

Simulated trades that take your ego out of the question. Once you jump into the market with real money, you'll be met with adversity unlike anything you've experienced papertrading.

**What should I avoid when starting out?**

Avoid following a strategy under the auspices of a guru. This will lead to your trading demise. Many traders fall into this trap.

**How do you know who is a guru VS a real trader?**

Some guru's are legitimate traders, you need to keep a keen eye on what they're showing you. It might be best to look at the traders who aren't selling anything.

**Can you actually be profitable daytrading?**

Yes.

**How do I create a strategy?**

This ties back into where you should start. Once you have a grasp on what you want, seek out traders who have a similar style. See what they do, and pay attention to all the small details.

**How do I refine my strategy?**

Record your trades, making sure they are in real time. When you rewatch those recordings, don't try to predict or solve any problems you might be seeing... just observe. You'll probably find greater success observing because you'll notice trends. Observing allows you the freedom of building a habit as opposed to temporarily solving a problem.

**What's a good trading method?**

Anything that gives you consistent success. Overtime, the numbers will add up.

**What broker(s) do you recommend?**

Centerpoint, cobra, and interactive brokers. This is for my trading style, so it may vary for you.

**What's the hardest part of trading?**

The psychological game of losing, and your ego. Once those too are settled, you are set to grow.

**How to stop overtrading/undertrading?**

Trade smart. Sometimes overtrading/undertrading will work in your favor. You may have to ask yourself if it'll work in the long run. Keep that in mind.

**""My plan seems to work, but somethings just not clicking. I trade well, but it doesn't amount to wins.""**

Disciplined ego-free analysis of your trades will slowly solve this problem. It's likely a myriad of factors.

**How do you ""read the tape?""**

When you record your trades, make sure to include the tape. Notice trends in the tape when the stock bottoms / tops. Look out for fake orders, and a slowing in price action.

**How do you scalp?**

Trade around panic, whether that be from short sellers or longs. When people hit those market orders, you have an edge. It's quick, so you may need hotkeys just incase. Have pre-determined price points to trade around and stick to them.

**When scalping, what should you be looking at?**

The tape, the price action, and the chart. Everything else should be predetermined.

**What can you do to make ego-free trades?**

Read books; I'd recommend reading Principals by Ray Dalio. Play chess or any hobby that helps you think about the plan instead of winning. Meditation.

**What's your opinion of options, futures, or forex?**

Too slow. Hard to predict given random market circumstances. Dominated by big money.

**Why do you trade (x) size?**

My sizing totally depends on the trade. Sizing is one of the biggest trading blunders people make. I prefer to hit a lot of singles than a home run. Usually a per-share amount. If it's an illiquid stock without much movement, probably 1k shares. Ideal set-up? 6-8k.

**What size do you recommend?**

1/3, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1. It depends on the situation, and what you're willing to lose. Ask yourself this, does that loss feel like a small paper cut, or a massive blow.

**Do you feel scared when you make a trade?**

Not anymore. I used to have a stomach twisting feeling, but overtime it went away. The market is totally out of my control, and I learned to accept that. What was in my control was the planning that went into the trade; giving me confidence.

**""I get into trades and I routinely find myself overconfident""**

There this saying: it's better to be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right. The root cause probably isn't overconfidence, it's a lack of proper planning and risk management.

**How do I toptick and bottom tick consistently?**

You probably can't.

**What indicators do you recommend?**

VWAP. I hear other traders that scalp use pivot points. Support and resistance lines.

**""I blew up, now what?""**

This is the turning point. Do you truly love trading, or do you care more about what it'll cost you to succeed? Most daytraders go through this stage, and many find it to be the biggest point of learning.

**""I want to make (x) amount of money.""**

You might be into trading for the wrong reasons.

**Do you use any social media?**

No.

**What lifestyle is necessary to trade?**

That's for you to decide. Typically it's one that's healthy and free of emotional distress.

**How do you have proper risk management?**

Keep it simple. Make trades knowing the downside doesn't outweigh the upside. Make sure to take likeliness into account. Good pattern recognition improves the ability to access likeliness.

**How smart do you need to be in order to be a good daytrader?**

EQ&gt;IQ in daytrading.

**What's a good stock pick?**

Avoid stock picks.

**What are some rules you've accumulated overtime?**

Trade with intention. Avoid first day runners short. Be wary of spread, liquidity, and the SSR when determining an entry. Look up fundamentals of a company before making a trade. Review all trades after the day is done.

**Do you prefer long or short entries?**

Depends on the market. Typically I short.

**Why are you against chatrooms?**

They seem to sell people fantasies rather than truth. I recommend chasing the objective, not the subjective.

**Last trade you made?**

Basic posting, commending or slamming of a stock are for the most part indications of endeavored value control for somebody's benefit. Your default position ought to be overwhelming doubt. 

The main ""companions"" here are the individuals who offer graph/number information with others and let understandings of said information be YOUR OWN. 

Outdated brokers tend not to utilize diagrams or news for speculations, however just crude numbers. (The main truth in stocks) New school dealers will in general take alternate routes and depend on discussion hiveminds for affirmation inclination for how secure or unbound you feel about X venture. Keep in mind, everybody is a paid representative for THEIR OWN INVESTMENTS (purchase or sell) 

In conclusion, in case you're beginning with a low balance, you most likely need to utilize numerous financiers/locales to get a full picture on information. For instance these SEC affirmed financiers. 

TD Ameritrade-Has free Level 2 information with their ThinkOrSwim Platform whether you have cash in a record there or not. 

Etrade-OptionsHouse Platform is by all accounts the most powerful, easy to use, up to the subsequent stage on costs and allows you effectively enter in your situations from various financiers (ToS does this as well, OH appears cleaner/simpler to me. 

Robinhood-Let's you exchange for nothing. Yet, it's not cutting-edge, and it's not on the OTC Markets (generally penny's). 

barchart.com is a FANTASTIC site for information intrepretation. Awesome in case you're new.
