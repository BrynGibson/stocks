Here's my take. It's a pretty diluted company, in the fact that they have 259,500,000 shares (total including warrants and options). That's a lot... that being said, this drug would change the face of NSAIDs and possibly have massive implications in other drug markets as well. Celebrex sold for 60 billion, but I doubt they will be even close to that, as they won't be a commercial drug until they are FDA approved.

With positive results I would not be remotely surprised by a dollar to a dollar and a half.

With partnership... sky is the limit. Could be 2, and it could be 20. 

We shall see.

After that, would a partnership be liable to come in at literally any time? Or would a phase III completion be required before you'd likely see a partnership?

There are whispers that there may be a partner already waiting in the wings. 

So literally anytime. 

Without partnership, this company might be in some serious trouble though, as they most likely will need another cash injection in order to complete phase 3.",2018-02-23

Question for you, if you don't mind me asking. If the results are negative, and you sell everything lets say 30 seconds after the results are made public, would it be within the realm of reason that - even though you sold immediately - you still wind up losing essentially all your money?

I mean to ask - regarding the results - do you think it could be in any way difficult to interpret? Say, if the results are not absolutely 100% positive?
