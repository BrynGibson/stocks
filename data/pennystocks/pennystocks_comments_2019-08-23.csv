2,Bubbs77,exsy7my,/r/pennystocks/comments/cu6r5m/huge_revenues_out_for_invu_big_names_just_started/exsy7my/,1,I loaded up on this one a few weeks back. I believe this one will make its moves as more people become aware of who they are and as they release more revenue positive news.,2019-08-23

6,yarf13,extycm2,/r/pennystocks/comments/cueole/mvpv_possible_positive_reversesplit/extycm2/,1,"I've vetted 40 reverse splits in the past two years. It's about 60% of the time there's a short term spike after the split. This is due to the stock being minimum requirements for certain trading platforms by being above $5 or $10 or whatever else. 

The gains are between 10% and 1600% with an average of 23%.

The other 40% of the time the stock continues to plummet and will see massive losses. 30% to 50% down. 

The ones that seem to do okay are ones where the company's earnings are on the up and there's a split from below a standard threshold to above the standard threshold for majority of brokerages.",2019-08-23

9,beta-one,exudfty,/r/pennystocks/comments/cueole/mvpv_possible_positive_reversesplit/exudfty/,1,"I'm feeling the same way about it. The company has performed financially for a few quarters in a row now - yet it isn't reflected in the stock price. I think that is mostly because of the cap structure being such a disaster prior to this split + lack of cash. 

With both of those things rectified, I think some money money come into this.

Their IR firm actually did a decent write up on this. Nothing too good but it kind of breaks down the financial performance + why the stock has lagged.",2019-08-23

11,yarf13,exuop2n,/r/pennystocks/comments/cueole/mvpv_possible_positive_reversesplit/exuop2n/,1,Inconsistent. Most reverse splits seen to target the $5 threshold... A split from .035  to .525 seems more like avoiding the complete bottom out of the share price,2019-08-23

25,Bubbs77,exvwt18,/r/pennystocks/comments/cud82y/shipping_season_approaches/exvwt18/,1,If you look at the charts for the ones I listed you’ll see where they all spiked hard in late October and early November. There are a slew of other shippers that have done the same thing. Most of them are very low Floaters so it doesn’t take a lot to get them moving. The main thing for me is getting in early so that I can get out early with a nice profit without having to guess when the dump will happen.,2019-08-23

The functional parts of Naproxen relating to anti-inflammation seem to not be affected, and it has already been shown to have anti-inflammation effects at or above naproxen's, and all this study is testing for is efficacy (IE, does it cause anti-inflammation). The results WILL be good, the problem is that I am so sure of this, I wonder if the good results will be priced in by the time they're announced... Lots of warrants in the money to drive this thing back down, and we saw what happened after the last results...

The big shock would be if it is found to be way BETTER than Naproxen at anti-inflammation, even at these reduced doses, taken once daily, and with already proven lack of gastro-intestinal damage. It could be a blockbuster drug if it has all of these characteristics and gets marketed well.",2019-08-23

Originally I was just playing this one for the last results, have 10,000 shares at 20 cents for the run up to last results. Was up 300% at one point (for like a minute lol) and didn't sell, sold half at 55 cents, re-loaded 13,500 shares and 18,500 shares for my dad who became interested when I explained it to him, he's a big gambler and has a ""feeling"" about ATE, lol... So we loaded up in the mid-20s and low 30s and we plan to hold until results, sell our cost basis on results, and YOLO the winnings long-term to see what happens.

They will release news as they get contracts, as news releases start dropping your typical every day pumpers will start pumping the snot out of them pointing back to the trend in previous years along with the news of new contracts to haul merchandise in for Christmas. The pump won’t come from the company it will come from the pumpers in the market along with frantic buyers. It will be short lived and will fall back to these levels or lower before st nick gets the sled fired up. All this being said, if you get in on the front end and get in early you can make some money. I don’t have time to stare at a screen all day so I try to find the ones I can get in early and watch for a few weeks or months before taking profit. These shippers are some of them.
