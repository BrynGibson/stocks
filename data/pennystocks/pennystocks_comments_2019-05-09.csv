What they're doing is nothing new. I'll say it again though: the *way* they're doing it is very interesting (Get Credit Healthy) by getting directly in lenders faces and delivering a program to help people qualify that would not normally qualify for major purchases (homes/cars). When you think about it the banks made (and lost) trillions on sub-prime mortgages. Sub-primes are starting to make their way back into the ecosystem again.
