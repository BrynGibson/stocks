3,Does anyone buy and sell frequently to increase their share numbers?,dkdtzt,starrynight40,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dkdtzt/does_anyone_buy_and_sell_frequently_to_increase/,6,61,"I'm investing in a marijuana-related penny stock that virtually all business processes are indicating will take off in 2020. I know that everyone always says that ""their"" stock that they've picked will take off and such. I'm 100% confident and I'm an ""all in or not at all"" kind of person. I'm aware of the risks of penny stocks and stock market trading in general. I'm not putting myself out in life by investing in it. This is a hobby for me, but I'm doing it with intention to try  to make a decent amount of money for the future, of course. Of course, for everyone, that is the future goal.

I use a zero-fee Fidelity Roth IRA for my trading, so I'm putting in my own after-tax money.

To increase my shares, I use this method: 

For months, I've watched the price jump up and down in waves with about a 20-25 cent price differential per share. It does this jump literally every week or two and I watch it all throughout each day on my phone app.

So, say for example I have 12,500 shares that I purchase at $0.40 a share. That's $5,000 worth. I wait for the ""wave"" differential mentioned above and I sell all of the shares at, say, $0.60 or as close to it as possible. That 12,500 shares x $0.60 = $7,500 that goes into the Roth IRA core account when I sell the stock and I let it sit there until the price drops down closer to $0.40 again. 

In the above scenario, I've made $1,500 by ""riding the wave"" pattern that I see every week or two and didn't contribute a dime to that. That $1,500 buys an extra 3,750 shares if I wait to purchase at $0.40 again. I'm convinced that this wave differential pattern will continue into later 2020 when the company plans to actually ramp up production among all of the facilities that they're opening. So per that trade scenario above , I now have $7,500. I wait for the stock to drop to $0.40 again and I buy in again, but this time the stock becomes 18,750 and I technically haven't spent a time beyond the initial purchase. That $5,000 worth of 12,500 stocks? It started as much less than that, but I've done a lot of trades in between and jacked up the number of shares every time it dropped down. Granted, each trade is $4.95, so I only trade in bulk every week or two when I buy or sell.

The plan is to basically keep that pattern of buying and selling going until I reach 50,000 shares. As the number of shares increases each time, the amount of shares and money that will get made with each trade is considerably increasing with each trade. Eventually it will get to where each trade that I make for a 20-cent differential will give me many thousands more shares at a time.

Now, I know that at some point, the price may go above that $0.60 or so and at that point if I do see that happening...I'll go all-in and won't look for it to drop down to the $0.40 again if the stock is beginning to take off.

What do you think of this process and why don't I see a lot of people utilizing this? I never hear people talk about this method. I guess maybe because the stock their in isn't as predictable or something. It has gotten to the point where I can virtually ""call it"" for the stock price every week or two and I'm nearly always right for this particular stock that I'm invested in. On a lot of these forums, I see people simply buying in at, say...40 cents per share and ""holding"" for years. They don't appear to be trying to increase the number of shares by trading, they simply do it by adding more and more money. That kind of puzzles me.",2019-10-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dkdtzt/does_anyone_buy_and_sell_frequently_to_increase/
