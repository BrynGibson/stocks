4,$Vate information/opinion/dd,a3fshy,Creativity_Rater,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a3fshy/vate_informationopiniondd/,1,4,"Just wanted to throw out $vate for those who haven't seen it. It's price has shot up from \~.03 to \~.07 but I believe it still has a lot of room to grow. I was so confident in this stock that I invested my life savings in it, despite being a poor college aged kid, and I ended up twobagging my life savings. I also believe its pretty far above its next price floor, and its a volatile stock, so tread carefully. Please read the entire post and give comments/thoughts.

Elev8 Hemp AKA Vate (OTCQB) produces hemp coffee and has cbd gels. It recently cleared almost all of its debt and it announced its best selling month, which is partly why its price shot up. It also might be riding on the inflated coattails of its sister company, kgkg.

Another reason for the price increase is that Hemp production is about to be legalized in the United States through the farm bill. The bill has almost no actual effects on the current Vate product lineup, because it is legal to get hemp from other countries, and there's not that much hemp in its current products (so margins shouldn't shift dramatically).. The farm bill \*\*is important\*\* because public outlook may help influence major chains and its legalization can be used to spur stock investment/confidence/bubbles in hemp related products. 

Even if the company is shit there should be a bubble, look at MJ legalization.  

So the path for expansion is clearly through brick and mortar chains. The coffee is sponsored on amazon (owns whole foods) and it is in a decent sized grocery chain, Luckys (owned by Kroger). So while I doubt it would be picked up by Whole Foods/Kroger, it has connection to both, and it will likely be a solid pumping point/rumor mill. The company just tweeted out that ""its new distributor said its now in 36 of its stores,"" so Vate is clearly focusing on, and expanding in grocery stores. There is no way that news is priced in because the market is closed today and the tweet was sent (today) through a twitter account with almost no followers.

Vate has some small CBD stores, and has also teased CBD canned coffee and CBD Iced tea. No actual CBD drink products yet. The farm bill will help with the selling  of CBD drinks, and the company will probably release news based on a time related to the bill for easy media hits. 

Vate has a fuckton of pumpers on ihub that have already talked about its new yet to be created products, but Sipc was able to create a fantastic bubble for itself through its H-IPA beer despite it being pumped for a minute (although I'm weirdly confident on sipcs long term success so they could be unique). The Vate new drink bubble ideally will align with the Farm Bill Hemp/CBD bubble.

5,$SHMP - Important Patent News!,a3dlgz,dcstockjvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a3dlgz/shmp_important_patent_news/,1,11,"I know the markets are closed today but wanted to loop you all in on some good news on $SHMP before the opening bell tomorrow.

Looks like $SHMP have finally received their patent. They haven't released an official public release but some good fellow followers of SHMP have found that the issue notice was mailed today and the patent will be issued on 12/25.

You can look for yourself by going to the USPTO website. You have to go to the Public Pair Section and look for Publication Number 20170150701. If you don't have the time or run into trouble - here is a screenshot [https://twitter.com/penniesgonewild/status/1070314355806224384?s=21](https://twitter.com/penniesgonewild/status/1070314355806224384?s=21)

This bad boy is about to blow up. This company is disruptive to the seafood industry.

My personal opinion is that a big fish will come in and buy this company out in a year or so. ",2018-12-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a3dlgz/shmp_important_patent_news/

7,Back in business!,a3arpg,hackpennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/a3arpg/back_in_business/,1,2,"Sorry for the absence...I haven't been up to much other than enjoying my new Audi R8 and trading bitcoin. I've been betting against it with the US Dollar and finding ways to short Bitcoin based on the chart patterns. The same fundamental rules apply to this cryptocurremcy as does other financial instruments. On a daily chart, Bitcoin was forming a descending triangle and eventually started to crash around $6,000/BTC. Now it's approximately $3,800.  


As for penny stocks, there hasn't been much activity, but we usually expect more volatility during January/February (what I've noticed trading during the past 9 years). I think a lot of this volatility is from inexperienced traders who decided to start trading with their Christmas money and/or tax returns. So more money in penny stocks = more players = more volatility/price action. Supply and demand!

&amp;#x200B;

  


NVLN - This stock is up 32%, but it's still down from its initial highs of $1.70, so I wouldn't expect it to rise much higher. If at all possible, it could reach previous resistance at $1.70...but that's a big ""maybe.""  


AETI - This stock rose around December 3rd, and has sustained some volume...traders are holding this position. If price breaks previous resistance around $1.60 it could potentially climb higher. Watching this one...
