Do I think $BEMG is a legit company, yep. Do I think the stock can make people money in the long run, sure. I even have some shares of my own because of that. I just don't believe that posting about it all the time is going to do the stock any favors, if anything it is going to turn off potential investors because it does make it sounds like a payed to be shilled/pumped stock.",2019-05-22
