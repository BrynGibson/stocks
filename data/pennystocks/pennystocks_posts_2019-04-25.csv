*Former Chairman of U.S Surface Transportation Board (STB)and Experienced Litigator* 

LAS VEGAS, NV, April 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- United Rail, Inc. (OTCPK: URAL), a short-line railroad consolidator and owner of the SmartRail brand for electronic Precision Railroading and brand licensor, today announced that it has appointed Daniel R. Elliott, Esq. to its Board of Directors effective immediately.  

Michael Barron, CEO of United Rail said, “I am pleased to announce that Dan Elliott has joined our Board of Directors.  His accomplishments in the rail industry and in his law practice will prove to be invaluable as we grow United Rail. We are honored that Dan has joined our team.  We know that his expertise will serve us well going forward.” 

Mr. Elliott is a partner in the Washington, DC office of Conner &amp; Winters, a full-service business and litigation law firm.

Mr. Elliott said, “I am delighted to join the Board of Directors of United Rail.  I believe that the Company has a solid business plan and a bright future.  I look forward to being part of the United Rail team.”

Mr. Elliott was formerly the Chairman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), an independent economic regulator of the freight railroad industry.  He was presidentially appointed to two terms in 2009 and 2015 and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate both times.  He was designated by the President to be Chairman for both of these terms until January 2017.

As Chairman, Mr. Elliott became an authority in railroad economic regulatory matters handled before the STB, in Congress and through the courts. He was responsible for decisions at the agency regarding complex rulemakings, rate cases, preemption issues, and major rail construction cases. He maintained constant interaction with Congress, especially the committees with oversight over STB activities, including testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on several occasions. 

Prior to assuming his leadership role in the federal government, Mr. Elliott litigated labor and transportation cases for sixteen years before the federal courts and numerous federal agencies.  He has appeared before the Surface Transportation Board, the National Mediation Board, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Department of Labor.  He won numerous significant cases before these agencies and in the federal district and appeals courts during this time.

He holds a B.A. from the University of Michigan, and a J.D. from the Ohio State University. ",2019-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bhcjrk/ural_united_rail_inc_appoints_daniel_r_elliott_to/

**California Recycles Adds New Customers**

Northridge, CA, April 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  [Crednology Holding Corp.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZHVKOFkvKO_ibiaqRXGw30LwNxckTqiPATR7X5yRoOMO5ZXvBgnHMBYZv8Psp2tla0QPPCrlToVXejBGvHGvgH9VSGGUpjPqZpZFx8JO9YY=) (OTC Pink: COHO; ""Crednology"") announces that it has made a substantial investment in new technology at its Santa Clara Data Center.

This new state of the art technology will double the company’s current capacity, increase speed, storage and Disaster Recovery services and reduce operating costs by as much **as $50,000 annually**.

The original investment was funded by Orie Rechtman in order to take advantage of a substantial discount offered by the vendor for a limited time. Mr. Rechtman’s loan has now been replaced with a conventional loan.

Our ability to meet the demands of current and future customers, at lower costs, gives us a great platform to build upon.

The Company is enjoying a strong April in its recycling business. Earth Day on April 22 always helps to increase our business as more and more businesses and individuals recognize this day as a very good time to recycle their E-waste products.

California Recycles also added new clients.

**The City of Thousand Oaks, Public Works Department**, signed an agreement to provide all their E-Waste products to California Recycles.

**NantWorks**, the parent organization of multiple Ecosystem companies, has started working with California Recycles for us to manage all their E-Waste products. The initial work called for several large truckloads to be recycled immediately. We started working with this new client last week.

Orie Rechtman, CEO commented: “We continue to look to the future with improved infrastructure in our cloud computing division. We not only reduced overhead costs, but we have the ability to manage much more business more efficiently and because of the cost savings, improve profit margins.”

Orie added: “Our Recycle division continues to grow. These two new clients improve revenue which results in more profit. ***As always, we continue to strive to achieve improved shareholder value.”***",2019-04-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bhccxu/coho_crednology_holding_corp_improves_cloud/
