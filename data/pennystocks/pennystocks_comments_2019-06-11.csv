NSAIDS (advil, naproxin etx) are notorious for causing damage to the GI tract. 

ATB-346 is a new drug that combines an NSAID with an H2S component (protects the GI tract). 

This is huge as I believe it would be the first NSAID/H2S drug to hit the market. My main concern is that this technology is not new, and has been done before with other compounds, namely NO to protect the GI tract instead of H2S.

Seriously, pennystocks are risky business. You seem to not really know much about it but the more money you lose to the penny stock machine the more you think you learn.
