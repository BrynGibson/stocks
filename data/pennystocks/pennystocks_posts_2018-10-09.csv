Then my buddy speaks to me yesterday, and he shows me the nuggets they are pulling out.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own 20K share at 0.76 cents (purchased today).

 I see this going up to $1.25 worst case scenario, and best case scenario to the moon, if not to the moon and back.

DD for RNX can be found here:

Eric Sprott also flew to the mine in Perth, Australia, checked it out, and immediately bought 4 million plus dollars worth of shares at around I think 0.10 to 15 cents, lucky guy already landed on the moon, then again he was on the moon to begin with lol.

Company registering COLA for hemp-infused beers Major Hemp Brown Ale and Major Hemp HIPA¬† ¬†  


COSTA MESA, Calif., Oct. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE ‚Äì Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in technology, manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, announces that it has completed new label designs for flagship hemp beer ‚ÄúMajor Hemp Brown Ale‚Äù and newly developed ‚ÄúMajor Hemp HIPA.‚Äù¬†¬†The company reports that it has also submitted both labels for Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).

Ted Jorgensen, President of wholly-owned subsidiary Major Hemp, comments, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making excellent progress with Major Hemp Brown Ale and Major Hemp HIPA and anticipate that we will be granted our Certificate of Label Approval this month for both hemp beers, which is the final requirement to meet before we can widely launch this unique pair of craft beers into the marketplace.‚Äù

Sipp Industries reports production is underway with Major Hemp HIPA at its partner brewery, Church Street Brewing Company in Itasca, IL.¬†¬†The newly developed hemp beer is currently in the fermentation stage and is expected to be completed and packaged within the next few weeks.¬†¬†The company plans to market Major Hemp HIPA in 4-packs of 16-ounce cans as well as kegs for the Chicago market, one of the largest craft beer markets in the country.

Over the past two years, Sipp Industries‚Äô inaugural hemp beer, Major Hemp Brown Ale, has been served in over 50 establishments throughout the state of Colorado.¬†¬†With the concept proven and increasingly growing demand throughout the year, the company expects 16 oz. cans of the premium craft beer will be very popular.¬†¬†‚ÄúOur distribution partners have been requesting cans of Major Hemp Brown Ale for some time and we‚Äôre very excited to deliver our product.¬†¬†We are in the process of scheduling our canning run for Major Hemp Brown Ale with Sleeping Giant Brewing Company in Denver, CO which will also consist of the combination of cans and kegs,‚Äù remarks Jorgensen.

The company also reports that it is currently in the final stages of selecting a beer distributor that will be granted rights for the distribution of Major Hemp HIPA throughout the entire state of Illinois. ¬†Jorgensen concludes, ‚ÄúChurch Street has an incredible reputation in the Chicago area and access to a number of Budweiser and MillerCoors distributors.¬†¬†We expect to have a final distribution partner solidified as production is completed.‚Äù
