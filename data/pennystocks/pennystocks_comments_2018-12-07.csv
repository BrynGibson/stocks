Before I start learning how to do it I want to know can I do it from everywhere. I come from a small European country and I can't even receive money via PayPal here (but I'll try to find a way around that) will I be able to trade US stock or is it region based?",2018-12-07

Iâ€™m trying to locate a stock screener that incorporates a news scanner as well. 

Anybody have any experience using StocksToTrade? Iâ€™ve read mixed reviews, but overall Iâ€™ve heard it has decent customization tools for searches and alerts.

Iâ€™m looking for a platform that I can familiarize myself for free before deciding if upgrading to a paid plan works for me.",2018-12-07

I would say itâ€™s not the absolute best tool, but if youâ€™re just starting out and need mobility, itâ€™s not a terrible way to approach it.

As far as the requirements as an international trader, I would reach out to e-trade support. Iâ€™ve contacted them once or twice and theyâ€™ve been helpful with information.",2018-12-07

Barnes and Nobel Education (or something like that...sorry i dont have my phone on me) was good to me today too...bought them after a huge dip though.

New Age Beverages has been a weird one....I've made money on swings but from a distance it doesnt look really great...it just seems to make decent moves if you jump in.

Solar companies have also been an interesting one to play with...i think most of mine have been solar and weed so far. I'm failing to recall any good ones in particular, i just grab one that down and wait for it to jump.",2018-12-07

I have just been given access to my trading account that my family setup for me a long time. It's currently in tdameritrade, from what I have read its a good platform for trading long term but not for shorting. 

I am wanting to get into the medical/recreational marijuana and CBD production companies. Does anyone have a recommendation for a better trading platform more suited to what I would like to invest my money in? And if so why is it better?

If this all works out ill buy any person that gives me advice a beer haha.
