7,You guys have experience in this kind of thing.,bkro56,blakdart,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bkro56/you_guys_have_experience_in_this_kind_of_thing/,24,10,"&gt;‚ÄúThe auditor, which is Pricewaterhouse[Coopers] in this case, hasn‚Äôt signed off on the 10-k,‚Äù Buffett says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something going on.‚Äù

&gt;In Berkshire‚Äôs first-quarter earnings report, the company said Kraft Heinz has not filed its 2018 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission or made its financials available to Berkshire.

&gt;Kraft Heinz has been struggling with its legal woes as it received a subpoena from the SEC related to its accounting policies and internal controls.

&gt;Warren Buffett said Kraft Heinz is in a dispute with its auditor, so Berkshire Hathaway doesn‚Äôt have the food company‚Äôs financials.
‚ÄúThe auditor, which is Pricewaterhouse[Coopers] in this case, hasn‚Äôt signed off on the 10-k,‚Äù Buffett told a group of reporters ahead of Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs annual meeting at the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska. ‚ÄúThey have to explain why they haven‚Äôt signed off, but they haven‚Äôt signed off...There‚Äôs something going on.‚Äù

What does it take typically for the Stop sign to go up in penny stocks? How much time would you argue Heinz has left?",2019-05-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bkro56/you_guys_have_experience_in_this_kind_of_thing/
