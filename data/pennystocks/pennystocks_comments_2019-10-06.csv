 Both.  A lot of research went into our algorithms.  Literally everything from chart indicators, to SMAs, floats, RSI, patterns, ect...   one catagory in particular is designed for day traders to alert to stocks right before they run for about 20-30 mins.  Each category we have has notes on how to trade using that list as well.  It does decent.  It's something that we are working on and fine tuning.  

It also has a catagory that just displays 52 week highs in real time when they hit it if you prefer to trade for long term movement as well.  But any scanner can do that.  I understand that. 

&gt;Based on what parameter, RSI? Oversold is subjective.

I understand oversold is subjective.  In this case, same as above, it uses an algorithm that will utilize in real time all possible data.  It also has a lot of human touch and trial and error on what gets displayed.  Unfortunately I am not at liberty to run through all the data of the algorithm.",2019-10-06

It seems he's trying to portray that his website, which advertises itself as the trader making ""easy money"" with ""professional stock tips,"" doesn't game people by taking their name and information. Your first and last name would be a non-essential part of a signup sheet, most pumper services only need your email. In this websites case, it's creation seems to be made to extract data, otherwise why else would it be made? 

**Ask yourself why this website is being made.** Potentially to help the average trader ""make easy money"" as they wrote, or to take your data and sell it to real pumper networks? This is commonplace now. His marketing tactics of seeming ""honest"" by sending YOU a personal PM is lovely. It's almost certainly to mine your data or potentially pump stocks, but pumping seems more extraneous. Don't mean to sound cynical, but rather explain the dubious intentions potentially behind what drives someone to make a website like this. If you believe his websites innocent, try posting about it to the 3000+ similar shams on forums like siliconinvestor during the dot com boom.

&gt;\&gt; We have a screenshot that he's potentially using his website for DATA MINING purposesl  
&gt;  
&gt;You have a screenshot of the website that I sent to everyone.  And no evidence of anything with data mining.  Yep, people can subscribe.  Just like any website.  Yep, we use professional strategies.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; It seems he's trying to portray that his website, which advertises itself as the trader making ""easy money"" with ""professional stock tips,"" doesn't game people by taking their name and information. Your first and last name would be a non-essential part of a signup sheet, most pumper services only need your email. In this websites case, it's creation seems to be made to extract data, otherwise why else would it be made?  
&gt;  
&gt;Test users are literally given their own logins and do not have to sign up.  Do we have a sign up option?  Absolutely.  It doesn't extract any data..  Why is it made like that?  Because that's how the login feature works.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Ask yourself why this website is being made.  
&gt;  
&gt;So people can learn some strategies and make some money.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Potentially to help the average trader ""make easy money"" as they wrote, or to take your data and sell it to real pumper networks?  
&gt;  
&gt;I have never met a ""pumper network"".  And considering that I am not taking emails right now, how am I pumping anything?  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; This is commonplace now. His marketing tactics of seeming ""honest"" by sending YOU a personal PM is lovely.  
&gt;  
&gt;No, its how I send the login information for the test accounts, so trolls like you don't get the test account information.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;  It's almost certainly to mine your data or potentially pump stocks, but pumping seems more extraneous.  
&gt;  
&gt;Uh huh..  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Don't mean to sound cynical, but rather explain the dubious intentions potentially behind what drives someone to make a website like this.  
&gt;  
&gt;So that we teach people strategies and help them find good penny stocks that fit their trading style.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; If you believe his websites innocent, try posting about it to the 3000+ similar shams on forums like siliconinvestor during the dot com boom.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can try searching for it on scam websites, and you won't find it.... Can you guess why?  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Be cautious what's believed. OP may be a wolf in sheeps clothing. Dangerous!  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok.. I have a real website, and a real email, and a real reddit account unlike yourself.  Now ask, who is dangerous?  Hint.... It's this troll who deletes all of his comments and makes things up.
