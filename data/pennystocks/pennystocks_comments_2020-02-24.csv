While you’re doing that watch tons of free webinars and find out what type of trading you want to do. Then study and get used to making a watchlist every single day. Then start making trades with extremely small size to start practicing your entry and exits. Mastering your emotions is huge too but everyone struggles with different things. 

Listen to other traders and try and not make the usual mistakes. And again start with extremely small size. Helps a lot bc whatever you think you know, you probably won’t be able to execute perfectly your first time. 

Good luck",2020-02-24
