I realize that each company releases their earnings on different days but i was wondering if there is a deadline for the OTC. For example, all companies should have released their earnings by x date. Can anyone provide some insight on this? All that i have found so far is that most companies release their earnings between the beginning of January to mid January. I believe this is true for the stocks on the NASDAQ but not sure about the OTC.",2018-01-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7qhhn1/q4_financials/

Please request that he get a picture taken of Him,Trump,and the President of Kazakhstan in the same image. 

I feel that If we can get get 20 people to request him to do that  then he will do so if he hasn't already planned to do so already.

4,Long term penny stock trading,7qmwkz,fadyhanna54,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7qmwkz/long_term_penny_stock_trading/,8,26,"New to pennystocks but used to do long term investing a long time ago.

Was wondering, since I have to pay $5 every time I sell a stock, and I'm only allowed 3 day trades a week, it seems like the odds are against me to make money (Canadian regulations), would it be ok to buy a ton of pennystocks and just wait for weeks or even months until it's up 30% or more and just sell them all and do it again? Like buying $5,000 or more of shares in order to actually make it worthwhile in the long term. ",2018-01-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/7qmwkz/long_term_penny_stock_trading/
