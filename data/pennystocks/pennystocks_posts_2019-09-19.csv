3,KULR Technology Provides Battery Safety Solutions to Global Tier-1 Medical Device Manufacturer,d6dt4g,supernova2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d6dt4g/kulr_technology_provides_battery_safety_solutions/,1,0,"Global Tier-1 Manufacturer applies KULR‚Äôs proprietary technology to improve battery pack design and safety solutions within various product lines.

CAMPBELL, Calif., Sept. 19, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúKULR‚Äù), a leading developer of battery safety and thermal management technologies, announced that it has conducted testing and provided battery safety solutions for a global Tier-1 manufacturer of medical equipment and devices.

The testing included use of ISC technology for battery packs used in medical and monitoring devices. The ISC creates lithium-ion battery cell failures that mimic or recreate the most common types of failures such as latent defect or over-cycling. KULR also tested its NASA-utilized TRS technology in design solutions for use in the manufacturer‚Äôs battery packs. The TRS has repeatedly shown in independent laboratory testing to be the most effective heat sink that also prevents the impact of dangerous chain-reaction battery cell failures known as thermal runaway propagation.

KULR‚Äôs testing and safety products will enable this global medical device maker to adopt new battery cells into current battery packs with increased energy capacity while simultaneously maintaining high safety levels and backward compatibility within the same form factor.

‚ÄúWe are always proud to help our partners make their products better and safer,‚Äù said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR. ‚ÄúThe technology is out there, well tested and accepted, to protect consumers by making battery packs safer and more reliable. KULR is helping pioneer ISC testing and next-gen battery enclosures for battery safety within the mission critical medical device sector. We look forward to helping customers with their battery testing methodology as well as developing future battery configurations while ensuring backward compatibility.‚Äù

Although KULR has provided battery and other related thermal solutions for partners including NASA, research institutions and defense partners, the work included in this announcement represents a significant advancement into testing and solution design for commercial, public customers ‚Äì work KULR expects will result in successful commercialization across multiple vertical markets.

About KULR Technology Group, Inc.

**SEATTLE, WA / ACCESSWIRE / September 19, 2019 /** Baristas Coffee Company, Inc. (OTC PINK:BCCI) Amazon Prime has sold out of Baristas White Coffee single-serve pods compatible with the Keurig 2.0 brewing system. New Inventory has been produced and shipped to Amazon from Baristas newly purchased and installed a line of manufacturing equipment that now allows for end to end production of single-serve pods compatible with the Keurig 2.0 brewing system as well as the Nespresso single-serve system.

üì∑

Baristas White coffee is still available on Amazon via other sellers and at [www.trywhitecoffee.com](http://pr.report/GI6n4w-j) where consumers can also ensure that they receive the first of the new inventory with Amazon by clicking the Amazon link.

Baristas Espresso Roast Keurig 2.0 compatible pods can now be purchased directly from the company at [www.baristas.tv](http://pr.report/Py1BlUAh) or on Amazon at [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018VYOC0K](http://pr.report/0YcIzyO6) . They will soon be available directly from Amazon Prime as well. Espresso Roast represents the first of many single-serve products that can be produced on the new system that is now fully functional including those that may contain legal substances that could potentially provide benefits to those who consume.

Barry Henthorn CEO stated: ""Being able to react to a sudden surge in sales resulting from a very small marketing effort to existing customers is one of the primary benefits of our newly purchased in-house production line. We will now be able to ramp up our advertising with full confidence that we will be able to react quickly to increases in sales, managing inventories so that our customers will be able to experience our special products.""

The In-House manufacturing capabilities solves the previous supply challenges that were caused by long lead times and inventory management issues, coupled with Baristas ability to drive sales, out marketing its previous supply chain. Baristas will continue to utilize the relationship and capabilities of its co-packer for large runs but will now be able to fill in supply demands between larger runs as needed.

Baristas new in-house manufacturing capabilities will also aid in and accelerate the development of its new products and allow Baristas to partner with others who wish to bring their products to the single-serve beverage market.

Baristas will now be able to market its products with confidence that it will be able to keep up with demand and fulfill orders and a new marketing push is being implemented along with the new manufacturing capabilities.

The media buys and other cutting edge marketing are made possible and were created via digital media frontrunner ReelTime Media (OTC PINK:RLTR) [www.reeltime.com](http://pr.report/9vLSKxiI) whose capabilities are redefining how companies are evaluating and purchasing their TV, radio, print, and other new media. Baristas is now ready to support its new products and distributors with a marketing effort educating and driving consumers to consume Baristas historical and new products.",2019-09-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d6hgt1/bcci_rltr_amazon_prime_sells_out_of_baristas/
