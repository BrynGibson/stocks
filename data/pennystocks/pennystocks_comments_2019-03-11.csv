http://ir.regulusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regulus-reports-third-quarter-2018-financial-results-and-recent

Based on the 3rd quarter, I'm not able to find any announcements about revenue other than restructuring 
""Under the terms of the Amendment, Regulus is eligible to receive approximately $7 million in upfront and material transfer payments. Regulus is also eligible to receive up to $40 million in development milestone payments, including a $10 million payment for an interim enrollment milestone. In addition, Sanofi will reimburse Regulus for certain out-of-pocket expenses associated with transition activities and assume Regulus' upstream license royalty obligations. ""

Other than that they were operating at a huge net loss. You probably know more about this than we do, but I would be very quick to put a stop loss on this if it were to go down incase it is delisted from Nasdaq again. 

Completed reverse stock split and regained compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements: In a special meeting of stockholders, held September 28, 2018, stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to affect a reverse stock split of Regulus' outstanding common shares. Following the special meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors approved a 1-for-12 reverse stock split. The Company's shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on October 4, 2018. On October 18, 2018, The Nasdaq Stock Market notified Regulus that it had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. 

Is there significant news on this to where they would be bringing in revenue to make up for the loss? This was half ass DD on my part tbh but that's my thoughts.",2019-03-11

It just raises flags when theres confirmed front loaded turds and you've been in them. Idk what alerted you to LEAS, BBDA, UITA or LCLP. Ive seen youve made other trades like sears and bpth and admit losses so to me you're just catching volume alerts off people doing shitty things or seeing them pump, but you can see where things get sketchy.

The reason people are mad .. not really at you.. but the mods over at ihub knew about the lawyer. I gave them a little information and they responded instantly ""he wasnt convicted!"" That tells me they knew it was settled out of court.  The post is deleted by mods immediately and everything is hidden but you can see in the sticky about ""these are the facts"". 

If he followed the charts he would have bought in fully with his profits Friday afternoon or had a buy limit for today. 

Again, nothing against you man.. the money was there but I'm sure you can understand the frustration at the end of the day. A lot of people don't know that you're moving in and out of the stock you promote based on the charts.",2019-03-11

I think the plan is to use their big names in the investment game to sell this stock to other big names.

If they tell Ellen DeGeneres they need her to support the LGBTQ community she will say ""tell me how much."" Right?

They can then sell her shares at $5 a piece, and the stock increases. 

Eventually more people buy it at $5 a piece, and they sell it to someone else at $10 a piece.

Eventually someone like Warren Buffet might say ""I love this company, let me buy in at $20 a piece, and my friends at Microsoft will buy in at $25 a piece because it's a good cause.""

136,Legend_of_Science,eiaphs0,/r/pennystocks/comments/azx1fd/wtf_happened_with_leas/eiaphs0/,1,"My take:

People got hyped up about a potential merger, bought big and the stock went up. The people sold to get a round trip profit. This made the stock price sink, for which short sellers had a field day. People are still dumping their stocks because they are scared of bad news or other scam conspiracys which i think were made up by the short sellers. 

Prediction: When the price reaches a point where people who have gone in at a low price are not willing to dump, since they are waiting for the long run, then the short sellers can't short, people will buy in at the lower price 0.0019 at the moment, and the price will rise back to normal levels. The o/s will be held mostly buy long term holders. And sells will just be people looking to make quick profits, another i think after a few fluxuaitons, the majority of holders who are in for the long wait, will be preventing short sellers from causing a price reduction. Thats my spin on it.   


I have about $500 in so, i dont mind the risk considering the small stake. I'm long run holding while the typical penny flux irons out.
