5,RingOfFyre,ep39mz7,/r/pennystocks/comments/btmvks/this_video_helped_me_the_most/ep39mz7/,1,"I'm confused by something.

He suggests that the act of moving shares from ""outstanding"" to the ""float"" is what causes dilution in the value. How can that be? 

Isn't the market cap of a company driven by the share price * the number of outstanding shares? Why would moving shares from outstanding to the float cause dilution? It seems to me like that's just moving from one pile to another. I thought dilution would come from the issuance of *more* shares, outstanding or otherwise.",2019-05-27
6,dickwop,ep3acb9,/r/pennystocks/comments/btmvks/this_video_helped_me_the_most/ep3acb9/,1,"First of all Market cap is OS x PPS not AS x PPS. Outstanding shares are shares that are in the hands of people waiting to sell into the market (debtholders etc). Retail traders (you and I) only trade on floating shares not OS, and as the people that are handed shares in lieu of debt sell into retail the float grows.",2019-05-27

Sorry, yeah, I corrected that.

Following up, though. I agree that market cap doesn't intrinsically relate to company value since it's merely a share price calculation, but I'm still unsure of how more shares moving to the float causes dilution. At least, dilution in the sense of lessening of your stock value. I would think that the value should always be based on the total number of shares, not just the number of floating, since that can change at any time.",2019-05-27
8,dickwop,ep3bs5s,/r/pennystocks/comments/btmvks/this_video_helped_me_the_most/ep3bs5s/,1,"If you buy or sell a stock you only trade on floating shares, not outstanding. So if the PPS is .01 with a float basis of 100 million shares that is the circumstance in which it reached .01. As OS shares are sold into the float the circumstance changes which is dilution. If a ticker is being actively diluted it is the movement of OS shares to the float which dilutes your PPS value. 

You can look at OS as the potential for dilution, not completed dilution.",2019-05-27
