104,Dr_Emmet_Brown,ewuipbk,/r/pennystocks/comments/cpsq8r/yriv/ewuipbk/,1,"Well here‚Äôs the deal. HR asked for the case to be dismissed and they got denied. They now have two choices , fight it or settle. Considering the amount of leverage on YR‚Äôs side it‚Äôs likely that HR is going to lose and if they flat out lose it will expose them and open them up to a lot of other cases. Now if they settle which could happen any day even before 20th then they basically get out Scott free with a hefty payment. And no prying into other things. This is likely what will happen. So settlement at any time between now and 20th is what I think. Don‚Äôt miss the boat because when it leaves it will leave very quickly",2019-08-13
