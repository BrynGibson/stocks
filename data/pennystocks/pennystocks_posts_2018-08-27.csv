Cultivation + production + branding + distribution. By 2028 these guys are going to be huge.",9akbl5,NineteenEighty9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9akbl5/glh_is_buying_up_award_winning_high_end_boutique/,2,1,"I know we all have our favourites, I’m not here to shit on anyone’s picks, at the end of the day there are going to be tons of winners. Some big some smaller. Hopefully this will start off a little (friendly) debate. If the $100b + projections are correct the market cap of the US cannabis industry could be $1T + by 2028 (expected market maturity). That means we will be seeing cannabis companies with  $100b+ market caps. 

If you’re patient and stay invested you’ll make money. We are 18 seconds into the first quarter and the game just started. Stay invested. 

I do have a lot of concerns as to where the attention is focused and where top producers are choosing to allocate their resources. 

DD I did on GLH, it’ll help you understand where I’m coming from below: https://www.reddit.com/r/USWeedstocks/comments/8xq7ue/my_opinions_on_golden_leaf_holdings_glh_gldff/?st=JL7CGQ8Z&amp;amp;sh=e87aaff3

GLH update on Tahoe acquisition: http://goldenleafholdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FINAL-FINAL-GLH-Investor-Presentation-August-132c-2018-Post-To-Website.pdf


All the hype is currently surrounding a select few Canadian players. I was invested in them for a long time and rode the wave, but once I started to dig deeper into their businesses I became concerned for their long term profitability. 

I’ve heard discussions from Canadian CEOs regarding retail, branding and general distribution but the majority of resources are still being invested in cultivation. Why? Today we have so many cultivation facilities financed that as they come online we are going to experience an over production of flower. This will naturally crush margins at their core businesses, even if they expand into other sectors having a low margin or money losing core business will make that difficult. Cultivation is a low margin business when compared to oil or edible production. The reason I am so bullish on GLH is they’ve been quietly going around buying up companies with award winning boutique strains (like Tahoe) and plan on producing them at large scale for their retail, oil and edible lines. Just growing cannabis isn’t enough, firstly you need good stuff (which GLH now has in abundance), and you need a distribution system to profitably deliver your product to the end consumer, GLH advantage over other cultivators will be their massive collection of high end strains that they can sell cheap due to economics of scale. The CEO recently talked about producing a bunch of lines of edibles using top award winning strains and selling it for like $14 a package, bringing the good stuff to the average person at an affordable cost. They’ve received their extraction license and can expect to have gross margins around 30% going forward, that already impressive considering top Canadian producers are still losing money 2 months before legalization. 

These guys are thinking 3, 4 steps ahead and by the time the market opens up down south they’ll have all the supply and cultivation agreements in major markets like Nevada and California nailed down. GLH acquisition of Tahoe gives it 50% + market penetration at all existing dispensaries there. GLH will have a massive advantage when markets all over North America open up due to economics of scale the Canadian producers can’t hope to match without a major US footprint. I’m a long term holder of GLH, no plans to sell a share until 2028.

I’m not trying to crap on anyone’s favourites, I’ve worked in the investment industry for 12 years and the concerns I’ve brought up are standard regardless of what industry you are investing in. Time will tell who the winners are, but the mean time we can debate it like a bunch of Know-it-all’s LOL😜

Edit: Chalice Farm has 7 locations, the lowest volume does $100k/month sales, the highest $500k/month. They’re in the final stages of launching a franchise business in both Canada and the US, these stores are massively successful in a saturated market like Oregon they are going to do well just about everywhere. Slogging it in the mud in saturated markets mean they’ve got tons of experience from the get go, that’ll be a big advantage over a lot of producers now looking to enter retail.
