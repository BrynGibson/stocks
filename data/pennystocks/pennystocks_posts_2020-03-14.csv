From what I can tell from Sundance's recent stock history is that it's likely to hit $4-$6 at some point but there is also the potential for the stocks to rise to 20$ since they were at that price before COVID hit the market. They're currently at $2 a share right now and I'm thinking of investing something in it. I'm new to investing and doing it to the side as I attend uni, and I am wondering how bad it really is to buy a dozen at $2 and have it hit $1 and miss out on being able to buy 24 instead. There's been some talk about a bloody Monday, should I wait? Open to some general advice as well.",2020-03-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fift17/new_and_sundance_energy_stocks/
1,AYTUZ warrant,fidimv,sliight,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fidimv/aytuz_warrant/,1,10,"Hi all,

Have been researching random crap and during the AYTU buy I noticed the W and Z, which led me to research warrants.

From that I can tell the AYTUZ warrant had a buy price of $1.86 which would be awesome at the half a cent cost today, I'd load up on $10k worth for that kind of chance knowing the run this thing could make... Overnight millionaire chance there...

So then I thought, pretty sure others would know about this and the price should be near the stock price, but it isn't...

More research... Reverse split... 

So tell me if I understand this correctly. The 20:1 reverse split AYTU did after the warrants were issued means the strike price of $1.86 is now 20 times higher at $37.20?  So half a cent buys me the ability to buy the stock at $37.20, and is basically worthless unless it gets in the $30+ range without being too close to expiration which is about 18 months out... That all accurate?

Anyone mess with warrants? Seems like they're a lot like options to me, just company issued instead...",2020-03-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fidimv/aytuz_warrant/

Their conferences are canceling. It wasn't unexpected. They will still be meeting 1 on 1 with investors and presenting online.

Their form K-8 release today covered their presentation here:  [https://ir.oragenics.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-20-003925/ex99-1.htm](https://ir.oragenics.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001493152-20-003925/ex99-1.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

* P2 results release is still set for early April.
* They will be pursuing conditional approval after P2.
* They will be looking for pediatric guidance. AG013 could be very important for some childhood diseases.
* They are expected to already have inked licensing deals. (speculation based on repeated CEO comments)
* Someone is placing very large buy orders. Hundreds of thousands. We think they are continued insider buys *perhaps* to angle for a buyout. We'll know within days if they report.

OGEN didn't run today, but they are up to .55 AH and held their own. If the market stays off our legs, it should start building into results. If not, I'll hold for results.

Good luck out there!",2020-03-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fibgeu/ogen_update/

Disgusting.

They wonder why they lose. Oh, a win here or there. What about that time you lost it all on one trade? Forget about it. It won't matter if you don't trade well anyway.
