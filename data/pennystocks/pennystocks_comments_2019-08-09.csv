If $2000 could change things for you at the moment, sell it and take my advice here, NEVER look at it again. I’ve learned this the hard way a few times.

 I’m not saying I recommend you sitting on it either, but depending on your original cost and what $2K means to you at this moment, you could always sell 50-75% and see what happens with it later. 

You could take $1000-$1500 now and later on, the remainder could be worthless/what you paid for it. 
On the other hand, if you take the full $2K just to take it, would it bother you that the $500-$1K would be worth $2K or $5K later on?

So you have to pay interest on that loan, and when the value of the stock drops below a certain amount, they need you to put more cash in to support the loan.

If you've got cash sitting in account A, and your brother bought the stock with a margin loan in account B, then Ameritrade will move cash from A to B to resolve the margin call. You will still continue to pay interest on the outstanding Loan in account B though, and you will need to deal with future margin calls in the same way.

I'm sorry that you didn't realize that your brother had done this. 

Margin trading is inherently very risky. It can lead to much bigger returns if a trade works out, but much bigger losses if it doesn't, including the possibility of completely wiping you out.

Margin accounts are really not meant for people who consider all this stuff to be gibberish.
