""Highest Grade Gold Mines in the World The highest-grade gold mine in the world is the Fire Creek mine in Battle Mountain, Nev., according to 2015 data. With a gold ore density of 44.1 g/t, Fire Creek falls high above Macassa, the second highest grade mine at 22.2 g/t, which is located in Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Of the 10 highest-grade gold mines, a majority are located in the U.S., Russia and Peru, according to the 2015 data.""

These new prices that customers are getting use to will maintain. This means there is not the profits for large scale buyouts to make larger companies like the ones we know in alcohol. Add in the still very large black market, no exclusive branding, and the low barrier of entry will keep these companies small. Investing in companies that support the industry will be large.
