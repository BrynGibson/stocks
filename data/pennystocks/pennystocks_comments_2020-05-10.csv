If I have 100 shares I try to break it up in to portions I feel good on both sides up and down.

So 50 being your main portion probably at like 24% so if it tanks your not out to far usually I'll sell before it hits there

25 at like 12% so if it shoots and drops you can capitalize with out missing 

And leaving your last 25 to sell as it starts to heat up to offset your cost and if your wrong you have a few to hold if you feel confident it will go up at some point.

I can go into it more if you'd like but obviously each stock each day or even hour will need a different plan.

Red flags: Their studies only consisted of 250 people, with a trial time of only 14 days, not a great sample.  Also looks like there are some complications that will make it so doctors will only prescribe the lowest dosage, for the shortest allowable time.  Can also not work with peoples current drug treatment plans because it can negatively react with other medicines that help similar issues, which could lead to doctors not prescribing much, resulting in poor sales.

Bright side is, they just had a massive expansion of their sales team trying to get this stuff in the ear of every doctor they can, and we al know how the medical industry works so even despite its flaws it could be a big seller.  

All of this is kind of moot unless you’re going to long this penny stock (not a good idea IMO) because this whole pump is from media hype surrounding the announcement to market. If you’re sitting on this stock after it hits market waiting for great sales, you’re going to miss a lot of opportunity.  From what Ive read on stocktwits (so take it with a grain of salt), overall views of this company is kind of poor despite the upcoming hype, they take a long time to come out with similar drugs, they come out with stuff that competitors usually already have an upper hand with.

Also the current price of the medicine is like 1,100 before insurance and [some insurances](https://www.bluecrossmn.com/sites/default/files/DAM/2020-04/Final%20Consensi%20Exclusion%20QP38-20.pdf) are already saying they wont cover it, and users will have to buy an alternative.

I’m watching this one for more long term so I might average down a bit.  Part of their business is shipping vehicles which should pick up soon.  I’m in the Air Force and from what I’ve heard June is when we’ll be able to get orders overseas/end the stop movement.  That’s a big part of shipping vehicles is dudes love bringing their brand new challengers at 25%apr overseas.  Think long term this will do well at this cost.,2020-05-10

Few things need to happen in the next few weeks to make this run;

1) need to confirm 305m share count and 170m float which is rumours at this point.

2) debt restructured to something manageable for the future.

3) confirmed revenues and large increase in revenues. (While being profitable)


If those 3 things happen in the upcoming weeks. It will fly .25-$1 and who knows how much higher on hype and being directly working with Amazon.

I've been at the computer for 10 hours today doing DD and I only made it through like 3 companies. I'm pretty new to actively trading (traded here and there throughout the last 4 years, or whenever GTATQ went BK lol) so I'm probably going pretty slow. Here's some info on BIOC from my notes. These are things that INTERESTED me and this is MY DD. 

**BIOC (\~5.5m revenue \~1.7m revenue Q4)**

Technically he *can* trade all he wants without good DD, at least for a while. ;)

Also for anyone reading, ER can be impacted by good news, but it’s an earnings report, and while a big contract can affect those, usually the added value is already bought and built into the stock price. With few exceptions, the outcome of an earnings report can only be relatively accurately predicted with deep DD.

Alternatively, since ER results can be hard to predict, camp on stocks with good press a few weeks from ER dates, and sell the hype the day prior to those report outs. Might not take the rocket to the moon if they are good, but it severely mitigates risk of a bad report out - especially if your approach is limited DD.",2020-05-10

If he wants to spend 3.5 hours on a  company before putting money into it, then I’d say, he is smart enough  to not just jump on bandwagon hype stocks

Thanks! I think its only taking me 3.5 hours because I'm still pretty new and I end up on discord chatting with friends, making a phone call or reading the news. I think I could spend 2 hours on most stocks realistically. I'm not referencing all of this (EPS/Target price etc) but note it because it saves me time if becomes relevant I don't need another finviz tab. Plus like you said, I'm not only buying the pump and dumps and a lot of this info is relevant to getting in early.

&gt;I guarantee this guy loses less than most on this sub. So many “active”  users just want a quick dollar without any work. Good luck to you all.  It won’t work in the long run

Yup. I'm happy to cut my losses early. Knowing when to get in and out (good or bad) is super important and helps take out the emotion. 40 dollar loss doesn't make me emotional, but a 400 dollar one might. If you can avoid that it makes trading easier. I also LOVE research, Covid, gun violence, politics, healthcare, whatever it is, I am happy to spend 10 hours a day researching the numbers and considering different ideas on the involved topic. I've been that way for the past 10 years. I don't do this for a living but research is something that I truly enjoy.

Resistance at .52 with a second band of resistance at .70. If it breaks through the first resistance it will surely fall around the .70 zone. 

Looks to consistently (twice, so not enough to ensure) spike through first resistance and bounce back down off second resistance, dip below 50 and 100MA's, then spike a second time about half the first spike. Smartest to sell the first dip, but not the end of the world if missed.

Ktov... i made gains last week, in at .36 and out at .47, reenter at .45. Now the hype will drive this premarket up to .55, and it will drop to .47 by open... secure your gains then. Reenter at .47 to 4.9 is good. Sell at .62, that's the first hurdle.

After. 62, it will drop to .57, maybe 
.55, reenter one more time... the wall will still be .62 for a while, so make plays and secure gains.

If this goes beyond .70 to .81, beware and make a choice to exit for good or hold until news.
