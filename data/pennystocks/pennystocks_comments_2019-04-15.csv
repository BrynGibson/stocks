[Trade Ideas](https://www.trade-ideas.com) for quality scanners. 



You mentioned [finviz](https://www.finviz.com) already but here are a couple scanner settings I use:

**continuation plays (run screener after close for following day or pre-market):** go to the “Screener” tab and under “Descriptive” adjust *price* to your comfort level; adjust *current volume* to more than 2mm; *relative volume* to more than 2.0. Move to the “Technical” tab and adjust *change* to up 5%. 

-this play requires that the name made a steady move the prior day and closed near the high, then held near that day’s high overnight and during premature. The trigger to buy is the break of the previous days high. 


**swing trades (run screener whenever but look to open your position intraday close to support or resistance):** go to the “Screener” tab and under “Descriptive” adjust *price* to your comfort level; adjust *current volume* to more than 500k; *relative volume* to more than 1.5. Go to the “Technical” tab and adjust *50 SMA* to Price Above SMA50; adjust *200 SMA* to Price Below SMA200; then adjust *Pattern* to whichever pattern you like to trade. I like Wedge Down patterns. 

-the play is basically looking for a chart with a pattern and low risk entry point. I like to enter intraday so I can really dial in my level of risk. 




If you’re looking for a group to trade with, a head trader that REALLY knows his shit, and can teach you to trade confidently, with limited risk entries, and is genuinely affordable, check out True Trading Group. Even if you don’t want to pay for their courses just watch their videos on YouTube. Mike Edward is the head trader and I guarantee you’ll learn something from him no matter how much you think you know. There’s always something to learn. He makes understanding shit simple.
