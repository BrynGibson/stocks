2,AGRX short thesis.. Tell me what you think ?,epsqgj,JayceNugent,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/epsqgj/agrx_short_thesis_tell_me_what_you_think/,1,4,"AGRX - Agile Therapeutics Inc notes:

The company is cash strapped with only 18.37 million dollars on its last quarterly balance sheet. While its last years cash flow from operations was -16.89 million dollars. The company has been promoting itself a lot lately and has prepared itself for some investing trade shows in order to attract more investors.

My thesis is that the company needs to raise cash, which it will do by way of share dilution. Interestingly, potential revenue generating news has come out. All in all, the bet is in whether the news is planted to raise the stock price at an opportune time for the company at the expense of investors? Or that the recent price movement is a genuine price rally on new information? Only time will tell and I am short this stock.

3,Thoughts on $VRNA?,epsmoe,bubbafx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/epsmoe/thoughts_on_vrna/,1,4,"Hey guys, I’ve just started to make a killing off stocks after four years of trading. Anyway VRNA released great news on January 13th - 

[Jan 13](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/01/g15109837/verona-pharma-reports-positive-top-line-data-in-4-week-phase-2b-copd-study-with-nebulized-ensifent)

This has gone down since the best news in company history! It’s also got a decent amount of of cash and didn’t burn cash last quarter.

My guess is a big player knew about the news item before it was released and immediately took profits. It has failed to gain traction since, but dang nabbit this great trial of drugs still happened!! Looking like it could go to like $12 eventually. Should rebound real soon though.

Lost a lot, but I’ve slowly seen it recover since. Now that research is showing that the current flu vaccine is ineffective, they’ve received fast track designation from the FDA on Nanoflu, which has exceeded Fluzone results and has great outlook. They’re currently in Phase 3 and poised to announce final results around March timeframe. 

Definitely going to be a lot of hype surrounding this one, so if you’re in for some quick gains, you’ll have them, and if you’re gutsy enough to stick out the results, they could pay off big time.",2020-01-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/epzqq3/nvax/

Any suggestions? Is it a bad idea?

 

It’s no secret that penny stocks are a crap shoot. I’ve had just as much success/failure in the stocks I’ve heavily researched compared with those I’ve picked at random. 



I’ve decided that I want try put the small amount of money I’ve made in penny stocks into an algorithm. The time I’ve spent researching feels like a waste when then rando’s often do just as good. So why not let a machine go through the trouble? It could be as simple as having it invest $50 in the top five movers (under a dollar market value) and selling 3 hours later hours later whatever the outcome. 


Even if I lose all the cash it’s not that big a deal. I don’t get too attached to penny stock earnings because I always reinvest it in the topsy-turvy bullshit world of penny stocks anyway.",2020-01-17,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eq4bvu/any_thoughts_on_automated_trading_programs/
