We think it's because we are going to see some big PR coming soon. Its expected the next announcement the CEO is holding out for is FDA approval, earnings is already expected to be positive.

Go through the DD the guys there found some really interesting stuff. I think this can spike 2x+ very soon.

I‚Äôve learned so much in the 2 weeks I‚Äôve tried out these penny stocks. I‚Äôm sick at how greedy I am. I should be up 5k! I love this sub and know I‚Äôve been lucky getting all these hits.

Uavs was hilarious and I didn‚Äôt know how to use a limit order, made 1.2 k and was hovering 2.5k for soooo long.

MVIS made 600 instead of it hovering at 1500 for seriously a whole day.

And more recently mark I was staring at it at 2.4 all morning üòÇ, and then decided to take 1.9 for 900 shares. It‚Äôs even on the rise right now and I‚Äôm kinda kicking myself but I made money!

In the case of mark if I got in at 1.04 is it safe to assume it won‚Äôt reach that and I should have held considering all the information they are releasing looks pretty legit? 800ish profit

And then I tried an option yesterday with VTIQ 5 $25 5/15 and it hit 4.0 per and then I sold for 2.8 per. It hit 4.0 3 times and I got REALLY greedy and last 5 minutes EOD I got scared and then it skyrocket up to 3.5 before EOD. 930 profit. 

In the options case is it better to hold onto it until the 14th? Cause VTIQ is bullish or better to hit strike price then sell? 

Anyways it‚Äôs been great! Hoping I can learn so much more.",2020-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/giv03v/thank_you_for_this_community_im_learning_and/

SXTC used to be the most reliable swing from the .80s to $1.05/1.50 over and over and over. It got hit when people were focusing on COVID-19 plays and nobody was paying attention to most other stocks as you can see in the market. COVID-19 is obviously a huge deal in our economy and for a company as big and important as SXTC, with more news from catalysts coming, this thing could FLY at such a cheap price. This is possibly the MOST successful treatment of COVID-19 that exists.
SXTC just received approval for a government grant on March 16th to continue its TCMP, this means they are still aggressively focusing on the research and development of TCMPs (Traditional Chinese Medicine Pieces) for curing COVID-19.

‚Ä¢Bull or Bear  
‚Äî&gt; Based on positive sentiments from experts and their target share price being raised to $6 from $2.50, things are looking good for CBAY. üìà Already up over +100% from this time last year, the company looks like it could be making strong headway towards double digits again.

From what I've read, the glut won't be as bad, but it'll still be bad regardless. Even with reducing oil production by ~10% globally, demand still seems slow to catch up for the month of April.

1. Broke out of a long term downtrend about a week ago. Currently trading within a new uptrend channel 
2. RSI seems to be a bit overbought and MACD is way too high, so I would wait for a bit of a pullback before entering. Perfect entry: $0.54. Good Entry: $0.55-$0.56. Major Resistance is at 200 MA, or $0.60. 
3. 4H chart, 30 MA crossed 50 MA. 1-2 day hold until ER. 
4. ER is on May 15th, 8:30 am (The date of the ER was announced today) 
5. Also had news today that they cleared some issues with the FDA to approve their new drug

We could see a spike here prior to ER.

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.**¬†South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore,¬†research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms.¬†

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",2020-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gio8xz/512_weekly_update_and_expectations/

DraftClick was designed to assist in the fantasy sport player's ability to monitor changes in betting lines, breaking news releases, injury reports, real-time discussions in sports forums, fan sentiment, historical match-up data and other sources of data by incorporating all of this information into prediction results. This data was then presented on a version of DraftClick's user interface, which was then designed to enable transition of player selections to fantasy game sites.

You know what I'll just give it to you (but read this document please to educate yourself) - 

Industry - 

 Management believes, after review of certain reports by Eilers Research which studies the industry, that daily games will generate around $2.6 billion in entry fees in 2015 and grow 41 percent annually, reaching $14.4 billion in 2020. Fantasy sports place a premium on data, and technological and statistical advances have made massive amounts of information available instantly and for sale.   


&amp;   


Company Overview -   


 ClickStream is a technology based data analytics company focused development of analytical tools for high volume data analysis and related internet trends and associations.¬†¬†Our mission is to build value for our investors by commercializing the predictability power of discussions on the internet combined with other statistics in our ever growing database.

Additionally, here is a solid resource for the companies financials which are without a doubt, telling of where this company is heading and where it has been - I know there are others out there who can do a \*significantly\* better job is breaking down this information and advising on what the future looks like, and if this investment makes sense for us - I wish I was fucking superman and knew it all but, I believe we all have a part in this, and we can all support each other to make sound financial decisions and whether these decisions will in effect have a positive outcome, it is what this community is about.   


So, there it is.   


The ""on-the-surface"" DD that I pulled today and trust me, i'll continue researching because with 10k deep - it's kind of a big deal for me and i'm sure others that took the jump today into CLIS.

Clickstream Corporation is an upcoming app that offers a live gameshow that allows people to win money. The app is free but of course there's in-app purchases which will most likely be their primary source of income. From looking at their website the app kind of looks like HQ Trivia, a popular gameshow app that gives free money. HQ was successful so maybe Clickstream will be too. Their website is at the bottom if you wanna visit it (link 1)

On March 30 Clickstream filed a 1-A form. According to Investopedia this form is made by ""entities seeking exemption for registration requirements for certain public offerings."" I don't really understand this because the words are too big but from what I can figure they want to make a public offering without needing to follow a bunch of rules, I assume this is either because they are an OTC stock and it's hard for them to make an offering, or they're gonna file an offering to take your money and run. If you wanna read more about what a 1-A form is then go to link 2. The stocks average volume is 21,597 and today it was 8 million. The market cap of this stock is 1.24 million dollars.

Sorry if this post is short as I said before it's an OTC company and there isn't really much information on it as it was basically dead until now. I think it blew up because Brian Baldinger is going on their show/app (check link 3). I thought Clickstream was lying about Baldinger being signed but he posted the news himself on his Twitter so I guess not.

I've reviewed their technology and Qualigen has revenue on diagnostics with some promising Phase II cancer therapeutics. More info below.

**General Biotech Reverse Merger Play**  


Generally,  reverse mergers show up in biotech because companies fail often, IPO's  are expensive and their IPO politics are dicey. So they can be hit or  miss. Basically, the public company that becomes the shell is usually  just a placeholder and I think that's Ritter Pharms' role here. However,  the Ritters management seems to have held on to a low stock price for  about a year, while waiting for further progress in clinical trials.  
About  6-9 months ago, their investment/admin advisors were pressing them to  find a compatible rev. merger partner or some other exit. I'm not sure  if Ritter found Qualigen bc Qualigen was already looking or whether it  was just VC/investor/industry networking to find matching needs.  Probably the latter, as there's not really a strategic match in Ritter's  IP/products ... but there could be.

This article has a good overview on the subject: [""Are reverse mergers a good way for biotechs to go public?""](https://gilmartinir.com/are-reverse-mergers-a-good-way-for-biotechs-to-go-public/)  


**$RTTR: Ritter Pharmaceuticals**  


Ritter's  market cap is 22M, but has no revenue (all their eggs in one basket)  but I reviewed their combined SEC S-4 filings and both companies will  have \~ $11M in assets + cash, with Qualigen reporting $500,000k in  revenue from a ""FastTrak"" VitaminD panel and Testosterone panel, where  they own patents related to the FastTrak tech. So they'll at least have  some cash (about $4M - $6M, enough to finance another year of  operations? just my gut there, i don't remember their operations  specifically)

**Qualigen (private)**  


[Qualigen Therapeutics Pipeline](https://www.qualigeninc.com/therapeutics-pipeline/)  


Qualigen  has been filing patents and been in business for at least a decade.  Neither company has done this reverse merger before. Qualigen licenses  some tech related to their nano AuNP therapies, but I'm not sure of the  structure there. Qualigen's two closest products to market are from  their AS1411 line, which is based on binding to nucleolins on cell  membranes. These have been in phase II since at least 2013 (i'm just now  finding that out, so i'm not sure of the details there). the AuNP  product's are dependent on that AS1411 line and are still in pre-IND, so  not even Phase I.   


Here's the complete [reverse merger SEC S-4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1460702/000149315220005858/forms-4a.htm#z_005)  


**My overall take on it:**  


I  donno, it seems like a good short-to-medium position, maybe? i put $55  into it. I might lose it and I'm alright with that. there is a reverse  stock split of RTTR shares that will be 25:1 or 35:1 (so my 100 should  turn into 3 or 4 and some change). This class of former RTTR stock will  become \~7.5% of the total shares after the deal, where Qualigen controls  the remaining 92.5% of shares (of common stock, i think?). The details  aren't quite fresh in my head right now.

Anyway...  it looks like they will titrate new shares to the market as they plan  to use promising milestones in Qualigen treatment/diagnostic development  to drive speculation. In terms of going short/medium on the stock, it  seems like it's an alright deal, since there's only a few bottlenecks  for Qualigen that can sink the deal ... but they should be able to  compensate by developing new diagnostics.   


Both companies need  cash though and so that's a complementary benefit they're both getting.  They're both pooling their resources and probably liquidating some  assets.",2020-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gj9pam/ritter_pharmaceuticals_and_qualigen_reverse/

* NVAX just got an up-to-380-million-dollar pledge from a global pandemic nonprofit, nearly matching a $400-mil donation to MRNA by a similar group earlier this month.

We made adjustments to our position on this news.** Here's a quick download of what was found in the paper:

**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.

\---

The ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: 

1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news 

2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours 

3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses. Given this was a dose-ranging study, what we will be looking for in the 5/29 readout is how the higher dose groups in particular responded, since these will likely be the doses taken into the pivotal trial.",2020-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gj9b4t/allogene_allo_up_40_afterhours_on_positive_safety/

Some people say he never responded and was most likely a bit, these people came from this subreddit and only seen the last week of his posts. Scroll down a ways you‚Äôll see he use to be extremely active with responding to people but when you gain 6k followers in 7 days obviously you can‚Äôt respond to everyone.

And for the people saying he used his following for his own pump and dumps, I don‚Äôt believe that is true. Sure if all 7k people bought in on what he said just because he said it I‚Äôm sure it would change the market, even half that could. But when he was still making all these predictions months ago with only a few hundred followers, how do you think he even would do that with that little of a following? Even if everybody that followed him bought in which I doubt they did when he had a few hundred it wouldn‚Äôt change the market short term by 50-150% like a lot of his posts say. He was more or less a short term. 2+ weeks and you could have seen that if you even scrolled down 2 weeks. His calls don‚Äôt hit his goal until weeks after. 

Too many people high strung on emotions followed him and when they bought in and the market rose a little and then dropped from people selling (most likely people who also follow him from this subreddit who are just pumping and dumping right away and taking small profits)

I‚Äôve entered into MVIS, IZEA, GNUS, ZOM, FET, TTNP, and CLIS so far (in that order).  

What I learned:

1.  Don‚Äôt buy on the way up.  Buy on the dip.  Also note that it might not always be wise to buy on the dip because it might not go back up.
2.  Do some DD at the very least.  There are liars out here.
3.  Don‚Äôt get greedy.  If you‚Äôve made decent gains go ahead and sell.  Gains are gains.  
4.  Penny stocks go up and down rapidly.  Try not to panic sell.  We are human but try not to react based off emotions.  

I hope this is helpful to any newcomers as I am a newcomer myself.  $130 isn‚Äôt much but for just playing around on my phone and reading I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs decent.  When you start making wiser decision I‚Äôm sure gains will be larger.  There will be your fair share of losses but that‚Äôs to be expected.  Kudos and good luck to all you traders out there.

**eMagin and Apple**

In 2017 eMagin Signs Agreement with **Tier-One Consumer Electronics Company** \-

HOPEWELL JUNCTION, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 31, 2017-- eMagin Corporation (NYSE American:EMAN), a leader in the development, design and manufacture of Active Matrix OLED microdisplays for high resolution imaging products, today announced the signing of a development and licensing agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company permitting it to use eMagin technology. The program is expected to generate licensing revenue if the company commercializes eMagin's technology.

Evan Donoghue who led development of EMAN's high brightness Direct Patterned OLED is now Manager - Display Hardware Engineering at Apple - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-donoghue-7a97bb45/?authType=name&amp;authToken=tUc2&amp;trk=prof-sb-browse\_map-name](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-donoghue-7a97bb45/?authType=name&amp;authToken=tUc2&amp;trk=prof-sb-browse_map-name)

**eMagin &amp; LG**

LG would be interested in utilizing eMagin's direct patterning IP potentially as a manufacture for a company like Apple .

Robert McIntire with LG Ventures was on a panel with EMAN CEO at SID last year - [https://youtu.be/5J0PyaXNEhM?t=4](https://youtu.be/5J0PyaXNEhM?t=4)

**eMagin , Apple , LG**

Why Apple and LG as potential partners with EMAN?

Because EMAN clearly has a relationship with them .

Buried In a 2018 ""Red Herring "" prospectus was a list of ""Specified Investors"".

EMAN would have received a discount from the Broker fees if the ""Specified Investors"" had invested in EMAN because they had ""had discussions"" -

""According to a report from Bloomberg, **‚ÄúEmagin listed those companies in the filing because it had discussions with \[the companies\] at industry events,‚Äù** the company reportedly told the publication.""

The ""Specified Investors""

1. Stillwater Holdings LLC and its affiliates
2. Valve Corporation and its affiliates
3. **Apple Inc.** and its affiliates
4. **LG Display** and its affiliates
5. Immerex and its affiliates

However , none of the ""Specified Investors"" invested in eMagin at that time -

**eMagin &amp; Intel**

eMagin needs an on-shore supplier for OLED backplanes due to the military &amp; Intel could be a likely source .

Is this ""US based chipmaker"" Intel ?

Buried in this eMagin PR Jan 2018 -

Separately, the Company announced an agreement with a **U.S.-based chipmaker** to support scaling of mass production for the consumer AR and VR markets. This agreement will provide supply chain development assistance for eMagin to enable prototype and mass production of OLED microdisplays. As part of this agreement, eMagin‚Äôs partner will provide raw materials sourcing support necessary for scaling to mass production while helping the Company meet the cost requirements of high volume consumer segment original equipment manufacturers (‚ÄúOEMs‚Äù).

If i post DD, it could just be BS and you still wont bite. Check out my predictions at stocktwits @flip_your_wow.

I make some detail plays with entry and exit points on some.

My process is reading charts, ups and downs, and buy and selling bids and asks. One of the biggest point I check for is who's testing the waters and how often. Before a stock gets pumped, you'll notice the test buys and sells, if you can read that..  you can get in before the peak.

These aren't long investments, but a quick gain of 15 to 25%.

nxtd is being tested... buy in at .40 and selling at .44 to .48. This has already jumped in the previous weeks, and it's due for another. Realistically, i would buy and sell before the .52 wall. If you want to invest and hold long, mid June might pop to .70s to .90s.... for now, buy the support. 40 and hold.

Bngo is being tested. Once volume goes up,  it will go to .60s. If it breaks 60s, then we should see .80s and .90s with a new support of mid 50s.

I've been right so far with dffn, mvis, ktov, rmbl, and gnus... i don't claim to be right about nxtd or bngo, just saying the charts and activities are very similar.",2020-05-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gj7062/called_rmbl_ddfn_and_gnus_up_next_nxtd_and_bngo/

The last two months it‚Äôs been finding strong support at about .31-.32. And it only seems to touch that support point briefly. 

Since Covid, it‚Äôs been finding resistance in the low 40s but has hit that resistance ceiling multiple times. Twice in the past 2-3 weeks. Is it primed to bust through that ceiling? 

Seems like volume has been picking up somewhat lately. Countries starting to open back up. 

Company deals with China so was impacted a little earlier by Covid than others. It impacted their Q2 but they still remained profitable. 

I‚Äôm thinking of putting a good chunk of money on this one. While it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúto the Moon!!!‚Äù stock, I see it as generally low risk with a very solid chance of an eventual 25-30% bump.

Vslr: solar energy stock. You can swing trade this or just sit back on it. It has had constant growth for the past 5 years. It‚Äôs earnings have been bad but I bought because of the social aspect. Every change in society needs a catalyst and I believe the already heated global warming discussion mixed with the oil drop is a perfect time for people to start thinking green. The thing that most interest me is the consistent growth because it‚Äôs more security

Uco. It‚Äôs an oil etf. Because oil crashed the only way for it to go is up. An etf is safer because it mitigates if a specific company is doing well. 

Taco. Litterally all growth since corona virus stock falling. 

Mcf. Riskier oil but at this time I‚Äôll try my luck and try to make gains. It‚Äôs been doing me well.

Cnty. A casino stock that has had good growth since the market crash. I think with things starting to reopen this will only do better. Before the market crash it was 10$ now it‚Äôs 3.5$

For tsx I urge you to look at ipo.to and joy.to litterally super cheap stocks so a 5 cent gain is like 15%

Play. Dave and busters has been around forever and will be around long enough for me to profit. It may not survive in the long run but I‚Äôm just taking my money. It also survived in 2008

Again I‚Äôm not telling you to buy. But do your own research and buy what you think is best. These are my plays for anyone looking for tickers outside of mvis and biotech.
