1,TheEarningsTrader,f3okhgk,/r/pennystocks/comments/dhjvw2/earning_releases/f3okhgk/,1,"It all depends on the stock. Earnings releases do make the price change but sometimes they change in the opposite direction of the earnings report. It depends on many things not just the earnings release but also the over all trend of the stock and also the market trend so the stock may have positive earnings but because the market is down then the stock will still drop. And if the stock does go up it will return to the down trend in a relatively short time.

As you can see by my name, I trade earnings releases almost exclusively and this week there are a lot of earnings reports.

&gt; These frauds are nothing more than glorified pump and dump artists, lacking morality, ethics and integrity.
But beyond that, they're actually breaking the law and SEC rules.
&gt;Such a trader, instead of using knowledge and trading skills fairly, is in the business of manipulating stocks for personal gain.
&gt;There is no denying this fact, it is crystal clear.
Stock manipulation is illegal and such a trader should be banished for life by the SEC from the financial industry and prison time should be seriously considered in such a case.

 Just want to expand on your last point and share a different point of view. I think the SEC has been much more aggressive in pursuing micro cap fraud since chairman Clayton took over. 

In addition to enforcement actions against operators and financiers, they have gone after service providers like broker dealers, accountants, and crooked attorneys who play a vital gatekeeping role.

They have also expended considerable resources in delisting and eliminating dormant shells which are ultimately used to conduc future pump-and-dump campaigns.

However they can never do enough. Thats because the OTC is such a massive wasteland of broken dreams and fraud that they would never be able to hire enough people to completely clean it up.

If anyone is interested in reviewing what the SEC has done, head on over to sec.gov and look at the litigation and administrative sections of the enforcement area of the website.

And finally of course you all know that staff from the SEC reads this sub, right?",2019-10-14
