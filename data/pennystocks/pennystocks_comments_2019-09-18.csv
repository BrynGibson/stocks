If you read my comment and the context it was in you would have realized that that guy never set his price and set it to market at open. BYOC someone bought at .001 a share and then the stock traded like normal throughout the rest of the day at .1 a share.  Happened in the first Quarter of 2017 I believe. Anyways itâ€™s clear you know a few things of trading but have some sort of mental impairment. Anyways go ahead and burn your money on this POS stupid is as stupid does.
