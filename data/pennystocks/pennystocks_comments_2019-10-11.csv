If the volume is low then it’s very likely that the market making activity for the order books is also low, it’s also very likely that this stock is only listed on one exchange.

It's not giving any information that'll help create any blueprint on how to trade. Mostly just fluff. Here's an example on somewhat useful information:

You want to buy the low at times when the order flow fails to continue downward. In other words, when the selling is no longer able to break lower. This can happen in seconds, minutes, or even hours. Keep in mind that selling doesn't always equal longs selling, some are short-sellers taking sub-optimal entries. Because of this, short sellers will be ""trapped"" if the stock isn't able to break lower. If a stock is at 3.50, breaks down to 3, many shorts will chase that 3 break. This level is ideal to long, given the influx of short sellers + a non-break.",2019-10-11

The bid and ask. I’ve seen asks for .04 and bids for .02? That is a lot of money...

Bail on this idea you can profit on these sub-50 cent stocks. It's a long-term disaster for anyone except for the manipulators. I promise this is a waste of your energy. PGOL is a good example of a ""never trade"" stock. It traded a total of $1000 intraday. That's absolutely abysmal. Take the volume times the price to get a read on liquidity.

Volume * Price = Liquidity

Your order will remain open, unless you take a sub-optimal entry. There needs to be people to actually buy your sell order. If no one wants to buy, the price drops. If you get long on .4, which is hitting the offer (ask), you'll immediately be in a hole. You'd need buyers to sell into, hopefully on the offer to get a better exit. Problem is, with a spread of 50%, that'll be nearly impossible. 

&gt;I’ve seen asks for .04 and bids for .02? That is a lot of money... What is going on there? It seems to me a person could buy $1000, sell that stake a minute later and lose $500? Is that accurate?

This is why I shit on many of the stocks on here. Most don't know what they're actually buying. They forget that slippage will kill their profits. It'll follow a linear downward trend long-term. It'd be a constant uphill battle. Look to trade stocks with *liquidity*. Volume can be misleading because 1 million volume on a $40 stock is different than a $0.01 stock. If you bought at .04, with a bid of .02, you'd be an idiot. It'd inevitably put you red long-term, as it'd be an uphill battle. I can't stress enough to avoid trading stocks under 50 cents. They are all long-heavy stocks without much reason to go higher. People generate reasons, but they're predicated on greed.

Good luck.",2019-10-11
