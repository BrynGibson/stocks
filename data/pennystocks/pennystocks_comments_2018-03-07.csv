Bought in again in January '10.  Bought 900k @ 0.0022 thinking it would go again.  Nope.  Lost it all - $1,980.00.  A lesson there, I think.  Got so bad that at one time, Schwab didn't list its ticker symbol, just a file number.  In that state I couldn't get rid of it to claim the loss on my taxes.  Then last fall, spoke to my broker about just giving it away to get it off my hands and claim the loss.  He said Schwab could ""erase"" it but I would have to get my accountant to figure how to claim it.  Never got around to doing that.  Figured that, if it ever ""woke up"", it would be like free money.

Boy was I surprised and pleased couple of weeks ago when I noticed some changes in LDSR (I had been basically ignoring for  8+ years).
Having thought I had been burned earlier, I sold 400k @ 0.016 and recouped my money and a little more.  Got spooked and sold 250K more @ 0.0145.

Bulls want to see this break out of falling wedge. A break under .60 sends this to .55 easily.

180,glitchygal,dvdk3i1,/r/pennystocks/comments/82rxvz/back_in_drwn_0005/dvdk3i1/,1,Okay I haven’t done this flipping thing really yet but I just bought some at .0007 to practice.  So once you buy low and sell high then you have to hold it for a few days unless you have more money ready to go.  I guess I should start keeping a balance so I could do this several times.  So say you’re using $50 you would have to $200 money available and then you could flip 4 times? Or would it still say you had to hold the stock for a few days?,2018-03-07
