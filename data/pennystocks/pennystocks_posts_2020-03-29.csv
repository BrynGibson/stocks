Now some people believe that you need to learn harmonic patterns and candle patterns and all this other shit. It's beneficial for you to learn it, I will agree on that, however we are in the age of the world where technology can do all that basic shit for you.

Here's an example of an ""Indicator"" showing me simple Bear/Bull ABCD patterns. 

 https://imgur.com/cen5qjR 

Need to know the support and resistances of a stock ? Guess what, a simple indicator can easily do that for you.

 https://imgur.com/u15elOK 

You can literally find or create an indicator for any of your needs. You'll hear people that say ""All you need is Rsi and MACD"" ... Those people have never looked at any other indicators imo, considering there are ones that have been made that are way more accurate than both.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what if you don't have TOS and only want to use Webull ? Well, thankfully Webull has a few indicators built in that you can use that will help you.

Although I hate regular MACD, you can still use it to ""hopefully"" avoid being cucked in a trade.

 https://imgur.com/eyQ7f7I 

I'm sure with the above picture, you can see how you could get cucked. Get in at the wrong time and could end bad, get out at the wrong time and it could be even worse. MACD is a ""lagging"" indicator, which is why people pair it with RSI (leading indicator)

 https://imgur.com/eh84vQA 

You can see the benefit and drawback of it from the above picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine using something like this indicator that most people overlook.

 https://imgur.com/yxbop2i 

If you were Playing Contracts/Options, You could have easily bought a 200C for this upcoming week for under $100 and sold it for over $1,000.

My recommendation for anyone who is actually reading this shit, learn to use indicators. Every indicator has a set of rules that can differ for the time frame that it's set on. This shit can save you a lot of time and money. RSI and MACD are literally the most basic ones, don't be a fool and blindly follow those.",2020-03-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fr8r5t/list_of_everything_you_need_for_stock_trading/
10,Question on selling option contracta,fr8qfy,bobbyblank1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fr8qfy/question_on_selling_option_contracta/,1,6,"Been researching up on options, but I have a question about if you opt to sell contract instead of execute. 

Say you purchased 1 put contract with strike at 5, and stock drops to say 3$ and you decide to sell contract and take profits instead of exercising the contract on expiration. When you goto sell the contract, does someone have to buy your actual contract, or just the 100 shares of the stock that you are trying to sell? 

Hoping that makes sense, just trying to wrap my head around it. 

Looking at some stocks, they only have 2 or 3 contacts available, so it seems like when you would try to sell your putt or call, the probability that someone would purchase your contract would be pretty low. 

Thanks for any insight.",2020-03-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fr8qfy/question_on_selling_option_contracta/

I am starting to switch over to stocks that pay me to hold them while still doing penny stocks. Of course I still do penny stocks with ones I'm comfortable holding till its time to sell. I'm still new to stocks, 3 months experience, and I'm still learning.  


A few days ago JNUG, a gold ETF, became a penny stock and I notice it has a dividend yield of 3.80. I'm fully aware that ETFs are not meant to be held long term, but I'm not looking for a flip and just to hold it as a dividend investment. I'm planning to hold it for a very long time. Probably for the next few years. Also I don't mind if it goes from 5$ to 9$ mid day, then back down to 5$ since like I said, I'm planning to hold.  


I am just wondering if JNUG would be a good idea to hold long term. Since everything is at a discount right now, and majority of the companies are going back up. (Thank you 2 trillion dollar bill from Friday).

Let me reiterate- once the PR is sent out, the share price should rise nicely. 

I’ve done three posts on my DD with Aytu as to why I was bullish. Here’s the latest one:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fn0ouk/why_im_in_with_aytu/

Obviously, Abbott’s recent announcement about their rapid point of care kit does hurt, but it’s still not a serological test. Apples and oranges. 

That’s the good news. 
Now... onto why I am not long on Aytu once the PR hits. 

The main competition from a serological test standpoint and one that went unnoticed is from Henry Schein:
http://investor.henryschein.com/news-releases/news-release-details/henry-schein-announces-availability-coronavirus-2019-covid-19

For those of you that don’t know, Henry Schein is a MAJOR player in the distribution of medical supplies. In fact, they are the LARGEST distributor to doctor and physician offices. They own the space. They are ranked 242 in the Fortune 500. Ranked 242 of all companies in the world, people. That’s big. 

Additionally, Henry Schein was mentioned by name by President Trump on Sunday evening (3/29) when speaking about critical medical distributors he met with earlier in the day in establishing Project Airbridge. Their CEO spoke at the podium as well. 

Here’s an article about Project Airbridge from this morning that mentions the company: https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/29/world/asia/29reuters-health-coronavirus-trump-airlift.html

Henry Schein is all about distribution. That’s their bread and butter. Aytu has struggled mightily already with just 100k because distribution of medical supplies is outside their comfort zone. 

In the PR last week (linked above), Henry Schein stated that they will have several hundred thousand tests available on MONDAY (3/30), and SIGNIFICANTLY more in April. The CEO said on Saturday morning that millions would be made in April and distributed due to the tight relationships they have with manufacturers from both South Korea and China. 

With the mass quantities, Henry Schein will have economy of scale on their side as well as streamlined and less costly distribution channels. In other words, Henry Schein will be able to offer these tests at a cheaper cost than Aytu. 

Aytu in the U.S. will be a very small player compared to Henry Schein. Henry Schein is an EXTREMELY well-known, trusted, and respected name in the medical field. Aytu is pretty much a no-name. In fact, in their home state of Colorado, the Dept. of Health who leads the covid-19 testing there had never heard of Aytu prior to the Fox News report. 

If you’re a doctor, physician, or hospital... are you going to choose Henry Schein whom you’ve had a long-standing relationship with that also can provide the quantities you need for cheaper... or a no-name who has very limited quantities and cost more per kit?

In addition to Henry Schein, there are at least 17 other companies ready to distribute these serological tests:
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/blood-tests-battle-covid-19-us/story?id=69761676

It will be a crowded field that will be dominated by Henry Schein. Frankly, Aytu missed the boat in claiming the market and territories. 

————

Onto the second major reason why I will sell soon after the PR...

It’s been lost on a lot of people that Aytu has exclusive distribution rights from “L.B. Resources which licensed North American rights from product developer Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co., Ltd.” 
https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4256204

There are many red flags about that statement. First, in Aytu’s PR, they stated they have exclusive U.S. rights. It’s not exclusive for Canada and Mexico. They just have rights to sell there under licensing from L.B. Resources.. but again, it’s not exclusive. Do a search of “exclusive” in the following PR about Mexico and Canada, and you’ll see exclusivity is only for the U.S.:
https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4265619

Second, and most importantly, L.B. Resources does NOT have exclusive rights to the U.S. to distribute Zhejiang’s tests. Aytu’s agreement is with L.B., not DIRECTLY with Zhejiang. What does that mean?

With the labeling that you see that shows the Healgen and Orient Gene logos, Aytu has exclusive U.S. rights with those labels. However, Zhejiang can always establish OEM partnerships with other U.S. companies. As you can see, it’s not as exclusive as it originally seemed. 

The source for this OEM info is in the comments of this YouTube video (a vid that’s been circulated widely). Look for the questions about Aytu:
https://youtu.be/5bRK1-gQAt0

Third, in the summary of that YouTube video, it stated that Zhejiang is looking to “donate” tests to the United States. It would not surprise me if the 500,00 tests that Jack Ma (Alibaba CEO) donated were from Zhejiang (though I admit that’s speculation:
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/tech/jack-ma-face-masks-us-donation/index.html

In my personal opinion, Aytu will see a nice pop in share price when they finally announce the tests have been sold and distributed. They had $7M in revenue last year, which is minuscule so this will definitely help.. although we really don’t know what profit margins they’ll actually see (another red flag). Plus, don’t forget that shares of Aytu already are trading at 600% of what they were prior to the test-exclusivity PR. In many ways, it’s been priced in already. Still- I expect a nice pop when the distribution is confirmed to hospitals and medical centers. 

However, I will not be holding long after the PR due to the fact that Henry Schein will have a foothold of these serological tests in the U.S. In addition, Aytu’s “exclusivity” is not exactly what it seems for the U.S., and it’s not exclusive for Canada and Mexico.",2020-03-29,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/freqln/aytu_the_pr_will_be_nice_but_why_i_wont_hold/
