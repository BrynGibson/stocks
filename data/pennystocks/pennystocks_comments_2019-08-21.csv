Mine right now is right around .10 (Bought initially at .101, again around .105 and just bought a little more on the dip today at .0882.
I only have maybe 1k invested at this point, I tend to play it extremely cautious with penny stocks, and typically sell at least half when I'm up 100+% to recoup my capital.
I think they're a good company though and worth it for a long play (not usually the case with penny stocks) or cash out in a run up.  
They're expanding distribution and better yet, the product is selling. I like the partnership with ACBF and think that will greatly help exposure when the new drink hits the market.
