Too many eggs in one basket IMHO, whether you believe in them or not. Too many things can go wrong especially when dealing with a single company like $NIO. Also your position is already big enough that if you are right and $NIO goes to the moon that you will be sitting pretty as is. If you really feel the need to increase your position I feel like AT LEAST waiting until it shows some actual strength is a good idea. There's probably a good reason why it's down this much in the middle of a raging bull market. I have not done any due diligence on the company though.",2019-12-25
