However if you're just looking to screw around with stocks and just want to see how it works, they sell a really cheap practice stock called NVCN. It doesn't do anything but it trades just like a real penny stock and some people will even pretend it's good and have incredible news about it. It's like Santa and some people want to spoil the game for the uninitiated.
