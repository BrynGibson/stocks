SeeThruEquity Issues Update on Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST)

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / September 26, 2018 / SeeThruEquity, the leading independent equity research firm focused on smallcap and microcap public companies, today announced it has issued an update note on Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST).

The report is available here: ETST Update Note.

We are updating coverage of Earth Science Tech, Inc. (OTCQB: ETST, $1.13). Earth Science Tech is a biotechnology company focused on research, development, and sale of hemp-derived CBD based nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. CBD is one of the more than 85 cannabinoids identified in marijuana and hemp plants and is non-psychoactive with a wide array of therapeutic benefits. According to the Hemp Business Journal, the cannabidiol (CBD) market is estimated to grow by 700% to reach $2.1 billion by 2020, versus $202mn in 2017.

ETST appears positioned to compete for its share of this market growth, as the company has established broad distribution for its high purity CBD product line, covering more than 90,000 retail outlets. Moreover, the company's pipeline remains robust with an upcoming direct-to-consumer campaign with As Seen On TV as well as planned pharmaceutical products in coming years, funding permitting. We see ETST as a speculative growth company focused on the burgeoning market for legal cannabis and hemp while targeting the fastest growing sub-segment of the industry (hemp derived CBD).

Highlights from the update include:

We are updating our coverage on ETST following results and recent developments at the company. Highlights were as follows:

    1Q19 revenues grow by 64.8% to $166,891. ETST reported sharp growth in its FY1Q19 (ended June 20, 2018), with revenues increasing to $166,891 versus $101,275 in the year-ago period.

    Revenue growth is attributed to execution in the company's line of CBD nutraceuticals and supplements, which provide a revenue stream for ETST as it seeks to develop its medical device and pharmaceutical business lines.

    Positive outlook. Revenues are expected to increase throughout the fiscal year as the company meets demand from expanded retail distribution of its products, supported by pre-sales and a recent replenishment of product which should enable conversion to revenue.

    Deal with As Seen On TV likely to raise awareness. On the direct to consumer front, the company has engaged As Seen On TV to develop a direct response TV and web campaign over the next twelve months, which should provide further demand and an increase in awareness for high-grade CBD oil.

    ETST becomes full reporting OTCB company. We were pleased to see ETST catch up on its SEC filings with the reporting of its annual financials and FY1Q19 quarterly report. The company announced that its shares were uplisted to be quoted on the OTCQB, which is expected to offer higher liquidity and visibility than OTC.

Target moves to $3.60 as growth prospects take shape

Our target moves to $3.60 for ETST following recent results and a positive outlook for growth to take shape in coming period driven by expanded CBD sales and the introduction of the company's medical device MSN-2. We see ETST as a speculative company in the fast-growing CBD space.

Please review important disclosures in the report and at www.seethruequity.com.
