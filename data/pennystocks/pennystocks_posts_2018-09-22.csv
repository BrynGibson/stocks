5,"Antibe Therapeutics (ATE) : Insiders buying, licensing deal and price/volume thoughts",9hxk37,DesignPrime,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9hxk37/antibe_therapeutics_ate_insiders_buying_licensing/,29,12,"It seems like the overall sentiment for the stock as shifted downward since March until the last couple of trading days. I think the price today is a great opportunity for long term investors to get in before they release their next round of trials as well as short term traders as we might get additional licensing deals before trial results release.

The last 3-4 trading days has seen a significant increase in volume for ATE. Sept 18 - 749k volume, Sept 19 - 661k , Sept 20 - 1.66M, Sept 21 - 1.47M. This is in part due to release of insider buying ATE on the public market as [follows](https://www.canadianinsider.com/company?ticker=ATE):

* Sep 19/18	Wallace, John Lawrence (Common Shares - Acquisition in the public market)	100,000 @	$0.270
* Sep 19/18	Legault, Daniel Marcel (Common Shares - Acquisition in the public market)	100,000 @$0.260
* Sep 19/18	Wilson, Alain (Common Shares - Acquisition in the public market ) 35,000 @$0.270
* Sep 18/18	Curtis, Scott Wilson (Common Shares - Acquisition in the public market) 50,000	@ $0.260
* Sept 18/18      Bourgeois, Nicolas (Common Shares - Acquisition in the public market) 100,000 @	$0.262

The purchases of shares on Sept 18th and 19th by the Founder, CEO, CFO and other insiders is a good sign for the prospects of the company as the people behind the company are skin in the game prior to release of results. 

The timing for their Investor presentation update also so happens to be right after the insiders bought shares as shown on page 32 when the price was still $0.26.  With the updated slides, the next trial will be starting this month and taking 8-10 week to complete (Page 13).

Then we have a Licensing deal that was announced on Sept 5th 2018 with [Kwang Dong](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/antibe-therapeutics-announces-strategic-licensing-110000137.html). We saw the market react positively to the news with a open at $0.34 before a sell off for the next 6-8 trading days sell of from $0.34 to $0.25. Then we saw the insiders come in and scoop in shares. Obviously, they are seeing value at these price levels as the stock is trading at Pre 1A levels from the beginning of March but we have gotten a lot more clarity since then. 

They will be attending the [medical conference](https://microcapconf.com/) in New York on October 1st and 2nd for microcaps. Many investors and traders are just waiting for the trial results and are getting impatient but I think we might get some new license deals in the upcoming weeks like the one we just saw with Kwang Dong.
