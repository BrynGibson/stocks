2,Jpaperz,euteyip,/r/pennystocks/comments/chh3tk/trnx_my_post_didnt_post_at_820am_this_morning/euteyip/,1,"No, the key is to average in and not get excited on the pops, this way if they do R/S your initial average is cheaper 
Example

100@.25 =25 rs =1

100@.50 =50 rs =2

Lets say stock rs @.75 1-25 =18.50, how much did you technically save? Then let say if RS sold off to $10, your at a loss.  but if your initial average was .50 then your in luck, because the example stock is 10 bucks. (.50 x 25 =12.50). 

Stock will be very volatile. So thats why .50 is my max average for me. Cause im not buying 100 shares after the split at $18.50",2019-07-25

It seems a lot of regulation in Quebec and Canadian markets with edibles is what's holding them back. At least that's my understanding so far. I also read they are supposed to have a partnership with Molson which seems like a great thing. 

And if/when they do expand into the states I'm sure that would also give a big boost in price.
