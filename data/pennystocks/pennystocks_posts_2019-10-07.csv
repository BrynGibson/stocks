KULR Technology (OTCQB: KULR) has developed and patented it's carbon fiber based HYDRA TRS (thermal runaway shield) technology, which has tested to be effective at preventing thermal runaway cell to cell propagation. This technology is being utilized by NASA and recently it was announced that NASA is transporting laptop batteries to the International Space Station using KULR's TRS technology. KULR is currently working with world-class companies (developmental stage) with the goal of incorporating its thermal management material technologies into next-generation products like electric vehicles, medical equipment, and consumer electronics. The company presentation outlines this and is available to view here: [https://kulrtechnology.com/category/presentations/](https://kulrtechnology.com/category/presentations/)

\*\*Disclosure:\*\*This information does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of offers to buy any securities of any entity. My family has invested in KULR and I am personally acting as a consultant for KULR and have been compensated in shares for that role. I have done extensive research on the Company and personally believe it has exceptional thermal management technology, management team, and real potential to displace conventional thermal management solutions in the marketplace. That said, I am not a licensed financial professional and do not recommend you buy or sell KULR. There is obviously risk of loss when buying or selling securities and generally even greater risk associated with buying or selling micro-cap stocks. Some real challenges faced by micro-cap companies include raising capital, increasing liquidity, attracting institutional investors, gaining analyst coverage, and general mistrust of the micro-cap market. Micro-cap companies also tend to lack in resources and often struggle to commercialize their products or services in a meaningful way.",2019-10-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/des060/lime_scooter_batteries_explode_after_thermal/

When looking at the Interactive Brokers terminal it showed that the genius toddler was long Mattel, Inc. (MAT), Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) and Crown Crafts, Inc. (CRWS).

&gt;Take together, this shows a total of 12.5 million of shares traded since the maturity of the note. This translates into $187,000. With a 15% buy indifference, we can see roughly $150,000. The note is $115,000 (the “Note”), before giving effect to certain transactional costs including legal fees. Even with the raise in A/S (not effective), the O/S has stayed the same. The float is likely to stay the same as well. Most interesting is the reason for the note in the first place, and such a small one that appears to be already paid off.

Let me know if you are interested and I'll PM you the details. I'm not trying to advertise anything, I'm just looking for your honest feedback.

It seems he's trying to portray that his website, which advertises itself as the trader making ""easy money"" with ""professional stock tips,"" doesn't game people by taking their name and information. Your first and last name would be a non-essential part of a signup sheet, most pumper services only need your email. In this websites case, it's creation seems to be made to extract data, otherwise why else would it be made? 

**Ask yourself why this website is being made.** Potentially to help the average trader ""make easy money"" as they wrote, or to take your data and sell it to real pumper networks? This is commonplace now. His marketing tactics of seeming ""honest"" by sending YOU a personal PM is lovely. It's almost certainly to mine your data or potentially pump stocks, but pumping seems more extraneous. Don't mean to sound cynical, but rather explain the dubious intentions potentially behind what drives someone to make a website like this. If you believe his websites innocent, try posting about it to the 3000+ similar shams on forums like siliconinvestor during the dot com boom. 

Be cautious what's believed. OP may be a wolf in sheeps clothing. Dangerous!",2019-10-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/dedj4h/alpha_testers_bosus_breakout_system/
