0,We created a free signal system! Check it out!,e8pik3,BuildAWallAroundIt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e8pik3/we_created_a_free_signal_system_check_it_out/,1,22,"Hey everyone, my partner and I created a free stock signals system. **We don't require registration or any information at all from you.**

The signal system scans over 6,000 tickers on various time frames to help you identify possible opportunities.  

There is a price filter so you can focus specifically on penny stocks. For example, if you enter the number 5 it will only show signals for stock at $5 and below.

The signals can be found here: [https://thechartwhisperers.com/signals/](https://thechartwhisperers.com/signals/)

We detect the following things:

1. Various candlestick patterns (bullish harami, three white soldiers, etc...)
2. Golden and Death crosses
3. RSI levels
4. Volume based signals are coming later this week

Take some time to check it out and please provide feedback. We are always looking to improve the system and take constructive feedback seriously.",2019-12-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e8pik3/we_created_a_free_signal_system_check_it_out/

3,$STSN Bought some before their first news release (following reverse merger completion). People in groups started chatting about it last night.,e8s25b,Hellcat_v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e8s25b/stsn_bought_some_before_their_first_news_release/,1,1,"I mentioned $STSN last week, as I noticed FINRA approved their name change, which took effect last friday I think it was, and now they are PINK current. I was gonna wait till they release their first new release (since the merger), but I noticed guys in the rooms chatting about it last night. 

The float is only 1.1 million. Could see a couple dollars with just a little volume, so news is going to make it go mental. Check out the share structure lol. Crazy thin.

Now it's up 37% from my initial investment. Is there any news on this? I'm tempted to sell now, buy back later when it drops, but I don't know if it actually will drop, and I'm wondering if there's any way to figure out if this reverse merger will happen.",2019-12-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e8rf62/hdii/
