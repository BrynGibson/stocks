You hear about INPX   


You buy 10,000 shares at $0.10  


That's only $1000  


Which is 10% of your portfolio, still a risky play but lots of people yolo more    


I wouldn't recommend buying into any stocks like INPX or  FCEL that have ran their current runs, the support is rarely there to manage profits at the peak.

Getting a small account &gt;$1000 takes awhile if you don't yolo options plays and pray for the best, but its possible. Wouldn't recommend day trading as a newbie with a limited portfolio tho",2020-01-07

Same with twitter and ihub.

Bro, the stock has already started dumping, there's no way anyone with an IQ above room temperature believes you dropped like 25 grand into this company today.


I mean, one thing that's nice about this sub is that everyone is pretty open and honest.  


Although this sub doesn't make me money.  Following specific people on twitter and jumping in as soon as they start pumping something new makes me money.  I just reply and pretend I buy into their BS, talk up the stock myself in tweets, and pretend I didn't sell 75% a week earlier and keep at it.  I'm just waiting until some of them think I'm cool enough to invite me into private groups so I can actually frontload with them.  


So I mean basically I'm the person I'm complaining about.

In regards to penny stocks specifically, I browse this subreddit to see what stocks people are interested in.  From there I do my own due diligence to see if its worth investing into.  I like to focus on companies that have a new product coming out, and reverse mergers.  If the information I see looks promising, I'll invest a bit.  If the information I find looks really promising, I'll invest more.

Real DD is hard work, and with penny stocks its usually not even worth it since these companies almost always suck, hence the penny status. Start learning to quickly look through the basics, such as RS risk (listing compliance), catalysts, debt, and how the company is actually planning on making money eventually. Then look at volume, momentum, and hype.

Stock Screeners! Helps you find stocks on your own

Research Moving Averages. I use 3 exponential moving averages (the 9, 13 and 50). If I hear of a good stock, I plug it into stockcharts.com with a 30-day chart. If the 9 EMA has crossed above the 13 EMA, and both are above the 50 EMA, very good chance the stock will go up. The more distance between the 9 and 13 the better.

Watch out for volume. If the volume is too low, you may have trouble selling the stock.

Candlestick knowledge is also good. Different patterns can help you find breakouts.

Basicaly, find stocks through announcements and screeners. Then research the charts. Look at the last week, last month, last year and last 5 years.

Stay away from ""the next microsoft"" people. Usually they bought a ton of useless stock at a very low price and want to unload it on newbies like us.

Good luck!",2020-01-07

If it's on a nice trend I buy when it looks to bounce at the bottom of the the trend line (support) or I short the position when at the top of the trend line(resistance).

I like to correlate charts with spy, $add, and $trin. I also use floor trader pivots and parabolic s&amp;r. On top of all that I tried to keep up-to-date on my assets.

It is all speculation as of now but gauging from other formula companies this could easily go to $10 in a few years. Most of the creators of this product are long time industry professionals, so I trust their approach. There is also a great chance that this company will be  acquired by one of the big players. Either way seems like a nice pay day will come. Just have to hold it long enough.",2020-01-07

356,blinknow,fdw93dp,/r/pennystocks/comments/el34yn/teum/fdw93dp/,1,"They provide software for companies that sell cheap mobile cell phone plans. Think Boost Mobile. Let's say I want to start my own cell phone company, or if I'm Amazon, I want to launch my own cell phone. Pareteum, among others have contracts and software to launch virtual mobile service. Amazon has an Amazon branded cell phone, while the actual service can be ATT or Tmobile. They have lower priority on the network, as others pay a premium for the carrier brand, however with 5G coming, that throttle won't be necessary due to amount of bandwidth available. Also, I heard CBAND is coming on line or being auctioned, thus increased the options. From research I've done since November when I bought at 0.46. Sure I can dream big about the future, just need to decide what's my profit acceptance on them in case they do tank. I don't have a crystal ball. I also look at what major holders are in the company, that have much better analysis and potential ""secret"" information. As of now Blackrock is in probably to test the waters, but others have bought stake in them when the stock dropped. That's one of the things I look for ""less"" risk from my part..but I could be wrong. :)",2020-01-07
