1,RYU Apparel,aylnrp,fausthimself,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aylnrp/ryu_apparel/,10,10,"Flat sales and a low gross profit are most likely contributing to the stock price hovering around 8 cents a share for the past six weeks. However, I think this company has potential. They opened three stores in the past three months for a total of nine shops. Four in Vancouver, two in Toronto, two in Southern California, and one in Brooklyn New York. While other retailers are getting out of brick and mortar stores, RYU is trying to sell an experience and lifestyle. They have trainers and professionals in store to teach people fitness routines free of charge. The CEO’s parents started the high end fashion store Leone’s in Vancouver, and he’s spent his life learning and operating in retail apparel. The company originally made MMA clothing, but once the current CEO bought into the company he rebranded RYU into a yoga and fitness company, and two years ago he purchased all of the company’s old debt. RYU’s social media presence has around 39 thousand followers on both Facebook and Instagram, and they recently struck a deal with Jeremy Beiber to become the Global Chief Influencer of the company. I couldn’t care less about the Beibers, but Jeremy has over 2 million followers on Instagram, which could give RYU some massive exposure. Reading the customer reviews on Facebook, RYU appears to make quality apparel, which could prove to be a good alternative to Lululemon, since their quality is not what it once was. The technical indicators and moving averages suggest this isn’t a stock worth buying, but I think they are doing everything right to build a brand and boost sales, and for that reason I bought in.

Im still holding longterm for sure. But keep in mind the Europe expansion plan is in current still, and that this is definitely a stock to watch as of july2018 with all their acquisitions and events.

Based off their trends, one of their grants should be getting accepted soon as well. I wouldnt buy until .80 to be on the safeside if i were y'all.

Im sitting 1k shares at an average 2.62 sadly, but i was planning to hold this stock for 5 years anyways. Since before the reverse stock split 1:20..so im not losing that that much.
Wallstreet increased their prediction as well.

Open close monday .61/.615
Open close yesterday .63/.64
Open close today .638/.77

Currently Netlist is suing Sk Hynix the 2nd largest chip producer in the world located in China. They are also suing google , which just recently the court declined googles defense on all 3 major points they had. Knowing google that lawsuit will be drawn out even more with appeals and endless google cash, but this lawsuit has been going on for 10 years and could be worth 10 billion dollars . Just the news of googles defense being declined shot the shares up .30.  That's just google. We have plans to sue Samsung as well, and the hearing starts march 11 for sk Hynix . I honestly think this is a once in a life time stock. Everyone do your own DD but I think this could possibly be a $2-$10+ stock. If you do the research you will see. Usually a settlement of 100 million = $1.00 move up in share price. And that's for a normal sized company . Currently netlist is .5495 cents so 100 million to a company like that triples its value instantly , and it realistically could be a combined (sk and google) settlement of well beyond 300 million(more than likely way more) Which would translate to atleast $3 share price. Analysts have it marked as a buy and a price target of .88 cents.

The line of products includes Day Cream, Night Cream, Eye Serum, Face Serum, and Face Mask, all infused with the Company's full spectrum THC-free CBD oil.

""Our analysis suggests that Topicals are the gateway product for mass adoption of CBD by the mainstream marketplace for consumable goods in North America,"" noted CEO Nelson Grist. ""The total CBD market is expected to bloom by more than a factor of 20 over the next three years according to some leading estimates. That process is going to be powered by mainstream adoption of CBD, which may be led by products like those we are launching today because people are already used to skin creams with exotic botanical elements. It's easier for the average person to discover CBD this way.""

According to Cannabis Business Times, the market for CBD Topicals grew by 44% last year as mainstream adoption of skin care products containing CBD accelerated. The overall skin care products market is estimated to hit $148 billion next year, according to Statista research.

""We are building a vertically integrated model,"" continued Mr. Grist. ""Our success is ultimately going to be a function of branding. We are different from the ground up. Our CBD products will carry our Clean Life brand designation and come from our own extraction process. Top to bottom, we are going to embody what we believe our customers will value most.""

Management notes that this initial launch is in a product testing phase, and the Company wants its shareholders to test the new line of products to find out how potent and effective they are. Anyone interested in trying a sample of this new line is encouraged to email a request to: infofteg@gmail.com and include a name and address. The first 50 requests will receive a sample package (Face Mask is not included).
