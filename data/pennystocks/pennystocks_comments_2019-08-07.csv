31,Billy_the_Ruffian,ew75wm8,/r/pennystocks/comments/cn1pqf/just_turned_16_i_wanna_get_into_penny_stocks/ew75wm8/,1,"Hi, my man.  There's nothing wrong with being ambitious and willing to take on some risk. Penny stocks might be TOO ambitious at this time.  

If you've got some money from family or from a job, perhaps consider mastering a more conservative investment strategy for now with ETFs.  

I hate the idea of talking down to you because I hated that when I was 16, but if I lost 4 or 5 hundred dollars when I was 16... yargh, I dont think I would have handled it well. 

That being said, if you're dead set on this...

A 1000 dollars is probably a good starting amount to hold in cash, with smaller amounts from.that initial 1000 used to invest dont put it all in one stock. Start with small amounts when buying, dont get sucked into fear of missing out, you are 16. You have a lifetime to speculate on penny stocks. I have a personal rule, I never allow myself to invest more than a 1000 dollars every 18 months.  Helps me discipline my desire to buy and makes me more diligent in planning and timing my trades.

Do your due diligence, if you are interested in a company, get a look at their documents, see if they are improving revenues, if they are getting financing, who the officers are (if things look too good to be true, see if they ran any other companies and whether they are still in business or are making a profit.), learn the dynamics of the industry it's in.  A good rule of thumb is to invest in what you know, so if you are interested in fluid dynamics and precision engineering, for instance, maybe check out engineering firms.

Everyone has an agenda - EVERYONE.  And that agenda is make more money for themselves.  Take everything with a grain of salt and ask yourself before making an investment - who benefits when I make this trade? The money has to go somewhere.

Penny stocking is also not a solution, on the whole, it costs more money than it generates for a lot of people. If you are in need of cash, dont speculate, try to pick up more evening and weekend shifts.

Soooo... based on that, I admire your willingness to take command of your finances and make your own money.  Its a commendable and reasonable ambition to make more money. Good luck my man and never gamble more than you can afford to lose.",2019-08-07

You follow the NV state court filings; when the first filing shows up...it's a good entry imo even thought the stock has prob doubled or tripled, because that's just the start.

I'm a newb, so sorry if this is a dumb question.  Will the close of the offering cause the stock price to dip a bit?  I'm hoping to get in at around 0.32 or 0.33.  

Thanks!",2019-08-07

I've made thousands following some of his plays.  

Like you said, it's about knowing when to get out though, that's the most important part.  

Back in the winter Captain alerted to LEAS when it was sub penny.  Tons of people lost money on that one because they didn't get out in time.  Still plenty of people crying on the ihub board.  I made 8k though.",2019-08-07
