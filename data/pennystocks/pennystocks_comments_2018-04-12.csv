Novartis rivals Pfizer, and thats the kind of expert knowledge you want, a value driver so to speak. 
And the one of the reasons I suspect J.Wallace hasn't committed to a deal yet, is because I suspect hes trying to leverage a higher premium for co., given that pharmaceutical partnerships are based on a tier system thats relative to which phase of clinical trials its in, as I learned from the article.

First off, I googled ""SEDI reports ceo short selling"" without finding too much information suggesting this isn't super common?  Some folks have suggested that this was a way to leverage the cash to commit to buying options.  So short selling a stock as CEO if you had material info that the company was in bad shape but hadn't released that would be illegal insider trading.  Dan Legault is smarter than that.  Second, he doesn't get paid very highly as a CEO as this is not a Bayer or Pfizer... yet, I hope.  I heard he makes around 140k a year.  As such, he might not be sitting on a giant pile of cash with which to exercise options, so he may have spoken to a broker/lawyer and it was suggested to short sell 500k shares to raise the money to execute options which could be sold to close the short position.  The options are probably in the money as compared to the shares sold short, so he would end up with a net profit by doing this, and the company will end up with money it perhaps needs to complete phase 2b July efficacy study.  Finally, aside from the illegality of having done this if he had material info that the company would fail, he would be fired instantly if this were simply a trade against the company.  It would place the sitting ceo at a conflict of interest for the betterment and success of the company and the board would have him gone in 10 minutes.  This, then, must be a calculated move and almost certainly will be followed by an exercise of options/warrants giving the company yet another cash boost.",2018-04-12

54,tacopwnsyou,dxftz6b,/r/pennystocks/comments/8bm3sd/atv_atbpf_update/dxftz6b/,1,"Again, I'd like to cite my lack of experience first.  I've done a shitload of research on this company, however I am not a medical professional or expert otherwise.  I think this company honestly only has a couple possible directions, and it may be about a coin flip probability at this point.  However, having a 50% probability of success is about as good as its going to get in pharma/biotech where once anything is approved sp is going to skyrocket.  It comes down to risk/reward and the overall probabilities in the industry.  Risk is about 85% downside potential imo, they have Citagenix which is slated to soon become profitable and has annual income of 9M already.  They expect it to grow to 50M in the future.  That alone values them at the share price it is today, only you'd see huge downside if the drug side failed, probably want to panic jump off, and it'd shoot lower than true value imo, then come back up as Citagenix increased in value.  That could take years just to earn your money back and there would be better plays in the meantime frankly.  Only thing is, if the drug side fails, the drop will be sharp and fast.  Now to the upside, significantly higher than 85% upside potential.  I am personally hoping for a partnership leading to long term success rather than a buyout.  A buyout must be valued with all the risks built in, so a pre phase 3 buyout wouldn't pass 1.5-2B imo.  Company knows drug is worth that though, so I also don't see them settling for less.  I think its more likely they partner, and if they partner, pass phase 3, pass fda approval, and get a drug on the shelf..... the sky is literally the limit.  I would expect company value to be in billions which is 10x+ what it is today.  1000%+ upside potential vs. 85% downside potential and odds perhaps as good as a coin flip?  That being said, this is the extremely rare opportunity of a penny stock being a long hold for any of this to be realized.  All of this will take years, I think drug on the shelf or rather prescribed is earliest 2020.  Buyout could happen too, however, and would cause an instant payday of I'd say at least 400% to today's share price but possibly significantly higher.  Worth mentioning is the change of phrasing in their latest April 2018 investor presentation where they added language suggesting a buyout was possible.  It previously said strategic partnership I believe, and now mentions both as possibilities.",2018-04-12

Earliest we could really start phase 3 seems to be Q1 2019.  This drug is still a long ways away, but if and as it clears hurdles the sp will reflect any derisking associated.

Their most recent investor slide is a great place to start, then there are a bunch of news releases related to the studies but those are always just a couple paragraphs.  Still informative and if you read them chronologically they show the direction they've gone.

Also maybe worth checking out is the Zacks Small Cap Research report, which is worth looking at despite being paid for.  You can always verify the information and check out the science if you're good enough.  Worth noting is that most H2S NSAID papers have Wallace, the CSO of Antibe, as an author.  Its hard to find other information.  That being said, if Wallace thought this drug was a bust why has he spent his entire adult life developing it?
