PALM BEACH, Florida, August 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --

[MarketNewsUpdates.com](http://marketnewsupdates.com/) News Commentary 

As blockchain technology continues to transform a growing number of industries, the cost-effective data processing is allowing data center developers to run more efficiently including increasing power use capabilities. Operations have exploded overseas including in China, but now the United States has an amazing opportunity to step up and start taking part in creating mega facilities, or data centers with high computational power for mining that supports the transactions on the blockchain, hopefully diluting China's position in the blockchain market and giving the U.S. a bigger piece. Crypto mining is the necessary computational process of approving cryptocurrency transactions to ensure the integrity of the network since there is no centralized authority overseeing the blockchain ledger network. The rise of blockchain technology, especially for use in crypto mining, means data centers and cloud management services have to adjust to the changing realities on the ground conducive to offering sustainable infrastructures for power. Active tech companies in the markets this week include Mining Power Group, Inc. (OTC: RCGR), Global Blockchain Technologies Corp (OTC: BLKCF) (CSE: BLOC), Pareteum Corp (NYSE: TEUM), MGT Capital Investments Inc. (OTC: MGTI), Big Blockchain Intelligence Group Inc. (OTC: BBKCF) (CSE: BIGG).  


Mining Power Group, Inc. (OTCPK: RCGR) BREAKING NEWS : Mining Power Group announced today that it acquired the majority ownership interest of upstate New York technology company, Northway Mining, LLC, (""Northway"") which offers highly specialized data center hosting services for thousands of cryptomining machines. Northway, which will become a subsidiary of the Company, presently has revenues from its existing clients and also from an ever-increasing number of new clients.  


Included as part of the acquisition are real estate assets of substantial value from the purchase of the buildings in which Northway operates and a future building into which it will expand. In addition, included are 30 acres of surrounding flat land that will be used for future expansion of Northway as well as for the placement of industrial containers to house 1000's of additional mining machines for clients.  


Under the terms of the transaction, Northway will maintain its current management and the Company will invest funds for the expansion of its facilities. Additional details of the pending transaction were not disclosed but will be included in an upcoming 8K filing.  


Separately, the Company is in negotiations for a similar purchase of a majority interest in an unrelated privately-held company involved in the development of products for the cryptomining industry. Results of the negotiations will be announced at a later date.  


[Dror Svorai,](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=78930171&amp;privcapId=243963980) President and CEO, stated, ""This is something that we had been working on for a while and we are so glad to finally complete this transaction. We have not only entered the data center market… but we have done it in a big way that allows us to immediately begin a rapid ramp up of revenues.

Hal Turner, Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer of Pareteum stated, ""Our customers are telling us that 'telecom needs to change'. We have been listening.

(TSXV:**[**PAC.V**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pac.v) **-** [**News**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=pac.v)**) (OTC:**[**PACXF**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pacxf) **-** [**News**](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=pacxf)**)** (the ""**Company**"" or ""**Pacton**"") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (""**LOI**"") to acquire 100% of both the Yandicoogina and Boodalyerrie exploration licenses and mining leases from **Gardner Mining Pty Ltd** (""**Gardner Mining**""), an Australian proprietary limited exploration company. The acquisition of these two highly strategic projects was based on the strong relationship developed with Gardner via the Friendly Creek acquisition (see news release dated May 28, 2018). Two granted mining leases and three granted exploration licenses comprise a total of 146.80 km2 (the ""**Projects**""). The Yandicoogina Project includes \~4.7 km of prospective strike defined by structurally controlled quartz veins host to extensive historical gold workings. Significant rock chip samples within the Yandicoogina Project range up to 199.7 g/t Au. The Boodalyerrie Project is underlain by approximately 25 km2of sericite and silica altered granite with extensive quartz veining.

**Highlights of the Transaction:**

* Strategic portfolio of **2 granted mining leases** and **3 granted exploration licenses** (146.80 km2).
* Mining leases provide the potential for immediate large scale bulk sampling of mineralization. The 2 granted mining leases add to the 5 granted mining leases from the Friendly Creek transaction announced May 28, 2018.
* **2.3 km of strike of the contact between Hardey Formation and Mount Roe Basalt occurs within the Boodalyerrie Project.**
* **Considerable target size of Boodalyerrie Project due to being underlain by 25 km2** **of sericite and silica altered granite with extensive quartz veining. Historical high grade channel sampling including** **3 m** **at 88.6g/t Au and rock chips of up to 200g/t Au.**
* **Yandicoogina has multiple defined prospects with rock chip results of up to 199.7 g/t Au, high grade historical workings and cumulative prospective strike of 4.7 km.**

""*The acquisition of the Yandicoogina and Boodalyerrie Gold Projects provides a significant increase in the scale of exposure to the Pilbara region both in relation to conglomerate and structurally controlled gold systems. The high grade nature of structurally controlled gold mineralisation across an extensive strike length between the two Projects provides a compelling value proposition,""* **commented Alec Pismiris, Interim President and CEO of Pacton Gold.** *""We look forward to working closely with the Gardner team, as we commence the implementation of exploration programs across these particularly exciting projects.""*

**About Gardner Mining Team**

The director, management and associated consultants of Gardner Mining have extensive local operating history within the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The team is comprised of corporate finance executives, geologists, prospectors and mining executives, and has extensive ties to the local communities where it operates. Gardner Mining will work closely with Pacton as required to maximize the ongoing development of their existing project portfolio and to identify further value accretionary opportunities.",2018-08-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/95fl2i/pacton_gold_to_acquire_2_more_granted_mining/
