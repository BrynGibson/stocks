I think you should set rules for yourself. For me, getting in and getting out is a big rule for me now. So if I buy a stock I want to profit ASAP and get out of it before it gets too volatile. If I miss out on big profits because of this I will also take that as a learning lesson and re-adjust I guess but I think it is much more likely for these stocks to be pump and dumps then them ever being worth more than a few dollars and being your golden ticket.",2020-04-05

161,Knight_Aero,fmjb17s,/r/pennystocks/comments/fvmwyl/daytrading/fmjb17s/,1,"I started with a CASH account with just $600. Obviously not going to make a lot fast unless you hit home runs when you have buying power but what is nice is that it shows what you have available at one time. You cant short stocks until you hit the minimum for a margin account and you have no leverage until then. And any trades you make that buying power is unavailable for two days. I just use half one day and half the next and it kind of works out. Hope this helps. I have only been doing it for 3 months and my daily goals are really tiny like $5-10 a day but until I have a larger account I don't want to jump off a cliff from a mistake. I am aiming to make $200 a week eventually so I'll grind until then. More practice in confidence anyway.

EDIT: ignore the day trades left number in the balance as that only applies for MARGIN accounts. I spoke with TD and they said it's just a fixed thing and doesn't affect cash accounts. I used it early on myself as an indicator for when I have traded too much on a day which happens a lot LoL. Know when to walk away.",2020-04-05
162,Osman120,fmjb7lb,/r/pennystocks/comments/fvmwyl/daytrading/fmjb7lb/,1,So ur saying it only allows you to make a certain number of trades a day even with ur own cash acc?,2020-04-05
163,Knight_Aero,fmjc721,/r/pennystocks/comments/fvmwyl/daytrading/fmjc721/,1,"With the CASH account, there is a number ""Stock Buying Power"". This is the amount of money you can use to trade with at that time. So with $600 I can make a single trade of 100 $6 stocks or 10 trades of 10 $6 stocks. It doesn't matter the number of trades with CASH account. However, now that cash is tied up in the stocks you have now until you sell them. If you sell them the same day or week even you have to wait two or three days for the money total including gained or lost after you sold those stocks to settle. So until then your buying power will be 0. With a MARGIN account that has less then a specified minimum, you can only make three return trip ""trades"" like a BUY and SELL of the same stocks on the same week. When you cross the account minimum you may have more options but I don't plan on make it that far so its above my realm of knowledge. I do know that if you break this rule you may be asked to add funds into your account to meet the minimum amount or face a 60-90 day trade lockout where you can't trade during that period.",2020-04-05

180,numimaker,fmjgdh4,/r/pennystocks/comments/fvmwyl/daytrading/fmjgdh4/,1,"You can buy and sell the same stock as many times as you want in a day with a cash-only account. 

But.....

When you sell a stock, you don‚Äôt get the money immediately. You have to wait for it to settle. 

For example: 

I start with $6,000 in my account. 

I buy 1,000 shares at $1.00 for $1,000. 

My account balance is now $5,000. 

10 minutes later, I sell the same 1,000 shares for $1.25 ($1,250 sale with $250 profit realized). 

My account balance is STILL $5,000 until that trade settles (3 business days). 

You will eventually get your profit, but not on the same day.

Here‚Äôs what I do to work around this. 

If I have $6,000 in my account, I looks for trades where I can get in on something that I think will run at, say .30. But I don‚Äôt buy 10,000 shares of it. I get in for 1,000 at $300. Then when it runs to, say .43, I sell it for $430. I NEVER have more than 50% of my account balance ‚Äúin‚Äù a position for this reason. I have had WAAAY too many opportunities to get into something that could run 100-200% in a matter of minutes.  BUT...my account balance was so low and I had traded so much of my balance away that couldn‚Äôt get in.  Missed a lot of money that way. 

If you set a percentage limit on your account to actively trade and keep the rest for reserve, you can have money to trade while you are waiting 2-3 days for the funds to settle. Then just keep recycling ‚Äúhouse money‚Äù over and over again and by the time your trades settle, you are ready to use them to get into something else. 

I made ALOT of costly mistakes in the beginning 

1) Do your own research. DO NOT take someone else‚Äôs word that a stock will run. You will get burned...ALOT. If you don‚Äôt know what you hold, you are essentially gambling. The house always wins. 

2) Fundamentals matter, but for these highly volatile biotech stocks, technical analysis is better. On many of these they move completely contradictory to what a DIJA stock would move. These things move more on momentum and emotion. 

3) Understand you are NOT investing.  You are speculating. If you want to invest, go hit some blue chips and hold them. When you speculate, you determine beforehand what price you want to get in and what price you want to get out.  If you have a 40-100% return on a day trade...SELL IT and take your profit. Don‚Äôt let your emotion tell you ‚Äúwell if I hold this overnight, it could double again.‚Äù It will gap down and you will lose your profit. 

4) Set stop losses. If you buy a stock, determine how much you are willing to lose if it goes below what you paid. Then set a stop loss to sell it at that price. True me, it is far better to lose $5 on a $300 investment and get out than to pray it will go back to your original price. It rarely does that day, or sometimes it may take weeks. It can make you sicken. 

5) Never speculate with more money than you would be comfortable losing if you lost it ALL. Because you might.  If you can lose every penny and be okay with it, you are in a good place. 

Good luck to you and I hope you hit it big and rake it in.
