(look at GUSH and XOP holdings)  The other investor may consider this a cheap buy and hold option but there are other more  known  O&amp;E companies to invest in our there. You could invest 1000 shares for little money and hold for a long time.    $250 for 1000 shares. If it goes up 10 cents you make $100. It all depends on your intentions and how much you know about the O&amp;E industry.   


Here is XOP's holdings at this time.

&gt;Cameron Cravey was born on 02/24/1968 and is 51 years old. Cameron Cravey currently lives in Eustace, TX; in the past Cameron has also lived in Mabank TX. Sometimes Cameron goes by various nicknames including C C Cravey, Clyde Cravey, Clyde Cameron Cravey, Claude C Cravey and Clyde Cameron Cravey. Cameron's present occupation is listed as a Chief Executive Officer at Victor Henry And Associates. Cameron has many family members and associates who include Lauren Abbott, Haley Cravey, Ashley Cravey, Alexis Cravey.

He's barred from drilling in Texas so he hides behind his children and extended family to secure leases. He will then take that lease and sub lease it to naive investors. He dramatically over charged them for the sublease, then he offers to do the drilling for a fee. 

Once he has the money he send it to off shore accounts in his kids name and the money is gone.

I (Michael Kaminski), licensed my seismic technology to Geo-Enhanced and on July, 22. 2019, I revoked the license for breach of the license agreement. They could no longer use my technology. Since yesterday, we discovered the fraudulent sale of my technology to Demand Brands. If you are thinking about investing in Geo-Enhanced, Reliable One Resources or Demand Brands, don't. If you have invested in any of these companies, contact the SEC and report the violation and retain an attorney immediately. If you have questions, I can be reached at michaelkaminski@michaelkaminski.com",2019-09-11
