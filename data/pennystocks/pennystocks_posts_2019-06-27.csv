For everyone who‚Äôs been following my $HSGX posts, hope you caught some more profits after hours today.  As a heads up, this looks to be a potential runner tomorrow with the merger nearing completion and pending SEC approval, and off the heels of the S-3 withdrawal today after hours. More news is due and could drop tomorrow, and it‚Äôs finishing after hours holding on its R2 support for the day.

My current tip price target to exit before merger is .467 but will sell into it as it rises. 

Best of luck to everyone in their trading and investments.",2019-06-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c6cqhl/hsgx_withdraws_s3_filing_to_raise_capital_via/

LOS ANGELES, June 27, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barfresh Food Group, Inc. (OTCQB:BRFH), a manufacturer of frozen, ready-to-blend beverages, today announced that it has approval for 150 locations across branches of the military for serving multiple product offerings in dining facilities throughout the United States.  


Barfresh is well positioned to continue expanding its reach beyond the 150 dining facilities announced today.¬† The Company‚Äôs smoothies will be available in military food service programs supporting dining facilities and it‚Äôs solutions for all meal periods are designed to support a large number of personnel in a short period of time.¬† The Company expects to have 150 Armed Forces locations pouring product within 60-90 days.

There are multiple facilities at each military base location creating many expansion opportunities at current and new bases.¬† The Company is actively pursuing engagement with all U.S. military facilities and expects to gain greater penetration throughout the remainder of 2019 across the United States‚Äô 800 bases, which serve 1.3 million active troops.¬† In addition, the Company is pursuing international military locations in 2019.

Riccardo Delle Coste, the Company's CEO stated, ""We now have approval for 150 locations compared to 100 military locations at the beginning of 2019 and are very well positioned for additional expansion for many years to come.¬† Our great tasting better for you smoothie is a perfect fit for this high volume channel and we look forward to communicating additional placements this year.‚Äù",2019-06-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c68sr4/brfh_barfresh_expands_to_150_us_armed_forces/

CHICAGO, June 27, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE --¬†[Epazz, Inc](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jq30GnADkN7ZkNjagGBxqmu29NSAYjVdE6jayl9683Z04OXjhCeiWAuxHmCGpaZkl2XArnxJgZJb_II9AjpR6A==). (OTC: EPAZ), a leading provider of blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that the company is developing a Bitcoin sharing and blockchain social media app called Webbeeo. Webbeeo‚Äôs goal is to provide better privacy to users than the leading social media apps by using blockchain technology. The technology would allow users to have greater control of their data. Additionally, Webbeeo will use Epazz‚Äôs Bitcoin Wallet to allow users to share Bitcoin over the network. Webbeeo is currently in alpha testing with a beta release coming by the end of the summer.¬†  


In its early version, Webbeeo shares many of the features of the leading social media apps. And when the company integrates the patent-pending blockchain storage technology into the platform later next month, it will boast greater privacy than other social media sites.¬†

Webbeeo allows users to store data in and retrieve it from the blockchain, making it unnecessary for users to store data on their mobile devices. Only users have access to their data (and not third parties such as social media platforms), which is encrypted for increased privacy and protection. The company is using an open platform to speed up the launch of the beta site.¬†

Webbeeo‚Äôs Social Media Blockchain Decentralized Platform removes intermediaries, allowing users to have more control over their data and how they connect with others. Users control the platform as well as how their groups use the platform. The app will be available in the Apple App Store and on Apple Play.

Epazz CEO Shaun Passley, PhD, stated, ‚ÄúWe wanted to take advantage of the climate to hopefully attract a user base before the climate shifts. We have been working on a social media platform with the goal of providing enhanced privacy to the public. This is something we know the public wants. We believe in getting the site to the public even as a beta release to attract users. Once our blockchain storage technology is integrated, only the user will have access to their data via crypto key.‚Äù",2019-06-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c67zle/epaz_epazz_is_developing_a_bitcoin_sharing_and/
