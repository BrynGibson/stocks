(TOPS) were cut in half on very heavy volume in morning trading Tuesday, after the Greece-based tanker vessel operator announced before the open the pricing of a large stock offering at a substantial discount. The stock fell 50.5% as trading volume ballooned to 120.8 million shares, already well above the full-day average of 29.5 million shares, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. The company said a registered direct offering of 40 million shares priced at 20 cents a share. The stock had closed Monday at 54 cents, and the company had about 25 million shares outstanding, according to FactSet data. The stock offering comes after the stock rocketed nearly 7-fold (up 575%) over the past two days; the company said Monday that its 50% subsidiary, City of Athens Pte., concluded the previously announced sale of its M/T Holmby Hills vessel, with the cash release to the company amounting to $10.2 million.

NEW YORK, March 31, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (‚ÄúAnavex‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) ([AVXL](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=avxl)), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Rett syndrome and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases, today provided an update on the evolving COVID-19 condition and the Company‚Äôs response to its clinical program development.  


Anavex‚Äôs paramount obligation is to ensure the safety of all participants in its clinical programs and the integrity of the studies in which they participate. Anavex is responding to regulatory, institutional, and government guidance and policies related to COVID-19. Anavex remains committed to its clinical development plans and is working closely with all stakeholders to try to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the Company‚Äôs ongoing clinical trials for Rett syndrome, Parkinson‚Äôs disease dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

Clinical sites continue to operate and see patients where possible in accordance with local regulations and site policies, regulatory, institutional, and government guidance related to COVID-19. Clinical sites continue to screen and enroll patients into the active trials and the respective open-label extensions for the two Phase 2 Rett syndrome trials and the Phase 2b/3 Alzheimer‚Äôs disease trial, while the Parkinson‚Äôs disease dementia Phase 2 trial has completed enrollment and we expect to announce topline results from this study by mid-2020.

Anavex pro-actively continues to bring on sites in new countries across programs depending on the situation in each country of operations. While Rett syndrome protocols ANAVEX2-73-RS-001 and ANAVEX2-73-RS-002 have always by default allowed at-home visits, U.S. FDA and European EMA and Australian TGA recommended contingency plans are actively in place for the Alzheimer‚Äôs disease Phase 2b/3 study ANAVEX2-73-AD-004 and the Parkinson‚Äôs disease dementia Phase 2 study ANAVEX2-73-PDD-001 to ensure remote or virtual assessments for active patients and all respective extension studies.

Because ANAVEX2-73 is an oral formulation, study participants are able to receive shipments of their study medication in a controlled and compliant fashion, and direct-to-patient delivery is occurring in multiple countries.

‚ÄúWe understand that some activities will be temporarily slower because of COVID-19, however, our risk-mitigation actions were implemented for every project and Anavex‚Äôs primary focus is on the safety of all involved and the continued conduct of our clinical programs as we navigate the pandemic together‚Äù, said Christopher U Missling, PhD. ‚ÄúOur sites understand why their patients participate in research and are committed to the importance of clinical trials for those patient communities currently without effective treatments.‚Äù",2020-03-31

It ran to .97 the morning before the market meltdown started. I am hoping it will retrace to at least there before results.

After results, positive catalysts will be approval/conditional approval in the US, EU, or both and/or licensing deals. All of that is realistically possible.

Negative catalysts after results would be a r/S if the price doesn't hold above $1, a full P3 being required with no approval/conditional approval, and/or dilution to fund the P3 should no licensing deal be reached this year or investors found. They are funded into mid 2021.",2020-03-31

I like what the bio company is doing and burg needs to do a lot of changing or they will bottom out again.  I‚Äôm thinking they are looking for this new name and beyond meat (gross) to save them.

The company is unsure if the At-Home use application can be cleared for Pre-UEA at this point, owing to the historical use of EUA being limited to Point of Care usage.‚Äù

So pretty much the area they stated they would excel at and beat other companies at, the home test market, has a high chance of not even being a reality based of the historical use of EUA approval.

It‚Äôs quite possible but I think it‚Äôs more likely they sign licensing deals. Everything I‚Äôve seen points to them probably already having licensing deals in hand. Several companies have approached them and a few are now under non-disclosure agreements.

If there is a BO after good P2 results, it is most likely going to land around $5 a share. With FDA approval, that jumps to $10-$12, IMHO. They have more than 400 lantibiotics in their library waiting for testing funds that are quite valuable.",2020-03-31

The current development cycle is considered advanced development. For FDA EUA filing and the granting of a Pre-EUA by the FDA, the company is preparing its final working concept filing, to be completed within days of this writing.""

It goes on to say: ""On April 1, 2020 the company plans to begin development work on its second product design, a confirmation test for Covid-19. This test, a hybrid but direct antibody/antigen (IGG) method, again making use of the company‚Äôs expertise in biosensors, will be designed to be used on those the tested Positive Covid-19, and those that tested Negative but are suspected to be false Negatives.""

It's not necessarily *special* because it is just one of many companies developing test kits, but what makes it appealing to this crowd (r/pennystocks) is that it is a cheap buy‚Äîespecially right now‚Äîwith plenty of upward potential.

I could be wrong, but I think the demand for COVID-19 test kits right now is so high that there's plenty of room for many companies to make a profit.",2020-03-31

Even if AYTU takes 1-10% of the testing market, or let's just say sells 1-10 million kits at any price, it's not unreasonable for that market cap to bump up to a cool billion.  There's your first 10 bagger, kids.  I've never had one, but I've at least had the opportunity, and sold early.

Any tech startup knows (according to my old CEO) that once you have like 100 million in revenue, you're worth a billion or more to another company (even regardless of if you're profitable or not).  I think AYTU is undervalued either way, and even moderate success and execution will make most of these people wishing they had kept their cheap shares (even at $2).

643,GoodtimesSammy,fm2un6o,/r/pennystocks/comments/fso50s/oil_companies/fm2un6o/,3,"Obviously oil demand is falling right now and supply is ramping up. Not good for oil companies. 

But let‚Äôs test somethings

- low oil price = low capital investment
- low capital investment = production decline
- prolonged production decline = balanced supply and demand
- low commodity prices = distressed company failure
- low commodity prices = uneconomic renewable energy
- low energy cost and cheap labour = jump start economies 
- second world countries modernizing = increase demand
- world climbs out of covid/depression = increase demand to &gt;100 million bbls/d (it was 100 million at the beginning of 2020)
- Saudi / Russia pumping at max = no country can balance supply to renewed demand
Demand out paces supply = commodity price response

Makes sense. 

The lower the price for longer... the bigger the capex pull back. The harder the response on the other end. 

Investing in super majors that are fully integrated is not a bad play at all. They can withstand low commodities, make money through the value chain and are getting more efficient every year. They also have a diversified product mix - oil, NGLs and natural gas. Natural gas looks like the transition fuel of the future. Also, these companies are best position to transition into energy companies and adopt or buy renewables in the future. 

Investing in midstream and marketing companies is also not a bad play, they have less volatility but they don‚Äôt have the potential to jump as much either. 

I‚Äôd stay away from smaller, single basin entities because of the risk. 

There is also increased risk to total production - oil producing countries going into civil war as their countries fall apart. Venezuela would be an example. That‚Äôs more than a million barrels that would come off line. An attack on Saudi...potential for 13 million barrels offline. 

Bottom line - this world needs oil when it‚Äôs operating in a relatively normal environment...and a lot of it. 

Over the next 25 years I think you can make returns in this space.",2020-03-31

These transactions are common place and I don't think most people here have any idea what these transactions are.  I've been an option trader and day trader for 10+ years.  They (institutions) aren't down 2mm, these funds don't blindly buy them, there is no manipulation (there are in some OTC/PINK names that trade 50c wide on no volume) but not in NASDAQ listed securities that trade millions of shares and dollars a day.

Here is how it works (since no one bothers to read company filings...)

These deals are called ""structured transactions.""  If you look at the most recent deal on 3/19 and read the press release (no one reads the press release)...Warrants and stock purchased for a combine purchase price of $1.595.  Warrants have an exercise price of $1.47.  This is a 1 to 1 transaction, meaning for every $1.595 share of stock a fund bought, they received a warrant for free that expires 1 year from now with a strike of $1.47.  

For any of you option nerds out there, you know options are priced via a model called Black Scholes.  You can use some assumptions and come up with a value of the warrants.  Hence structured transaction.  1 share of stock + 1 warrant (with a valuation they assign) = a net price below the price paid.  

Most structured product funds don't specifically buy and hold.  They sell a portion of the long or sell it all and hold the warrant.  Or they do what is called gamma scalping, ie trading the underlying change in delta of the warrant associated with the spot moves.  To do this you short stock vs the warrants, and in a position where you are long gamma, you are always buying lower and selling higher.  

So if you know how to traditionally trade options ie trading implied vol/vega, scalping gamma (instead of what retail traders do is just buy options for delta and the implicit leverage) you understand that these funds.

So here is how you make $ at this.  99% of all small investors buy when a stock is rising and sell when a stock is falling.  This is called short gamma.  It's how you lose $.  Institutions buy when a stock falls and sells when a stock rises.  Long gamma.  These stocks go up and down daily.  If you buy lower one day and sell higher another day, you'll make $.  Simple.",2020-03-31
