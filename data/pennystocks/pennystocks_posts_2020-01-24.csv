5,GNMX- 19 cents a share,etc2ta,prestotheinvesto,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etc2ta/gnmx_19_cents_a_share/,1,0,Hello. Iâ€™m an investor proposing that users who see this join me in investing in Arvin Genomic Medicine. This morning they are at 19 cents per share but their records show that they are capable of rising far higher. Investing 19 dollars (100 shares) will give back a dollar for every cent the stock raises. I admit that this is for my personal interest but I believe that most people would like to have a dollar per cent return stock for only $19. Thank you and have a good day.,2020-01-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/etc2ta/gnmx_19_cents_a_share/
