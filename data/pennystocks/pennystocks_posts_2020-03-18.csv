3,This is a thread for people to ask about Options(and answer). Any confusion you have should be answered as right now is a wonderful time to use them.,fki07d,DragonElder,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fki07d/this_is_a_thread_for_people_to_ask_about/,1,50,Some questions I have or might be common. When you place a call do you gain money once it’s over the strike price. And do you gain money off a put when it goes below that price? Why are strike prices sorted into 50¢ increments? At what time can you collect your money from a call or put? Are there more types of options? To those that don’t feel it’s worth answering: yes google exists but it’s way more helpful to have a human answer the stupid little questions that may be catching people up.,2020-03-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fki07d/this_is_a_thread_for_people_to_ask_about/

Market cycle reached, and now the next wave of longs are fumbling their positions. People on here are panicking. They are buying everything that smells of profits. All morals, ethics, and other various ""normal"" factors thrown out the window.

This subreddit has turned into a bunch of apes banging their heads against a wall.

**This is becoming nonsensical...**
-

Faulty thinking, longs are literally sweating every time they make a trade. All trades are failing. People gloriously buying cheap stocks. 

This subreddit was once at 100 people viewing at once. Now it's gone through the roof! Although more people are freaking out. People are noticing this too, it's not just me saying this. 

Many people have commented about whether this subreddit is falling apart. I got a few PMs asking about the recent increase in negativity. Totally normal. Most users will be flushed out quicker. More volatility will erase more accounts. 

Expect more anger. Rage. Negativity. Resentment. This subreddit is feeling the full weight of why gamblings evil. 

**Why are you still trading?**
-


If you're going to gamble, pick your spots. There have been two recent studies about this subreddit. Both stated that **99.32% of stocks on /r/pennystocks fail after 6 months.**

A total collapse.

Although you can still profit. If you're a good trader, you can take advantage of this market. Perhaps some markets have good discounts right now. It's up to you to decide. 

Watch this subreddit at a distance. It could be a great source of entertainment. Many people are now beginning to see this subreddit as hysterical. Be on the correct side of the hysteria.

Let's say you make the best investment decision of your life and grow $1 to $1000 overnight from one stock.  You sell, and re-enter at $900 to get some additional value and/or solidify $100 profit.

Since every sale is a taxable event, ""sell and buy the dip"" would only work if the dip saves you more than the taxes cost, right?  In the example above, any tax greater than 10% would hose you on the re-buy.  Are people who trade this way working out of tax-advantaged accounts?",2020-03-18,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fkvg57/sell_and_buy_the_dip_vs_shortterm_cap_gains/
