And guess what?! .. there hasnâ€™t been PR this month so many shareholders believe a catalyst PR announcement this week is inevitable 

I would get in on Monday at around itâ€™s price right now .44 or it may dip a little at market open to .40 and ride it to anything above .50 by Wednesday as penny stocks with news or news coming tend to pump and dump because of fomo. 

Happy trading",2019-11-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e15m98/adxs/
