As you can see from the estimate it shows that with 100.000 Myflix users HHSE will have an instrinsic value of 0.064 with a conservative PE of 12. Remember Netflix have +125 millions user, and Myflix will be the streaming service with the most content really fast, do you think they can get 1&amp;#37; of the users Netflix have? That would make it 1 million users, do the math yourself and you will see why this is a no brainer!

22,JakeFromIowa,e2bxbie,/r/pennystocks/comments/8yhina/simple_questions_july_13_2018/e2bxbie/,1,"I started trading about 6 months ago, mainly penny stocks.

Once you get down all the terms and how to understand stocks, it really just comes down to your DD and charts.

Do as much research about a company as possible. Look at their products, market, and financials (make sure they are making money).

Research the charts and look at trends, make sure the stock is trending in the right direction and that people are buying and selling on a regular basis.

You can then also head over to investorshub to see what people are talking about on the company.

I also use traders news source (more for long term hold options), they always have good plays. 

I am up about 60&amp;#37; from my initial investments and i use Fidelity (4.95 per trade, Active Trader Pro is free).

Just takes some time, but it can be fun!

  
Good luck!",2018-07-13

I was in yesterday at 1.75 for 100 shares, put in a sell at $2.15 and watched it hit 2.01 and then drop like a rock down into the 1.60's. I got scared as it played around down there for a bit, so once it got past 1.75 again I sold, at 1.76. Ugg. It went down from there again, but then freaking shot up to $2.59 before the end of the day. Wouldn't have been a huge gain, but I was just looking for a quick pop because I knew the news was the catalyst, and also it was alerted by Dekmar Trades on his morning watchlist on Twitter. Kicking myself now, but at least i made a dollar. Hahah.

That said I was consoling myself that this does not look like a bad long term bet, the liquidity is a bit worrisome when you consider the price point, I like what they are doing, but if they don't turn a positive cash flow very soon, how far can that capital go? This sector has a tendency to be dilutive, but 86 mil SO is not totally ridiculous.   

Very capable of producing some immediate returns with the Humboldt facility rocking and 240 acre Nevada hemp planting. Italy does not have much competition so the Italy thing could be ginormous.

 If they can deliver on the above then this could be an easy ten bagger. I suppose it .20 for a reason, but it seems a buy for this sector for a YOLO play anyway. Then again maybe they are all crooks and I am a victim of buying into a pump and dump and am going to lsoe all my $$. :)

*We are working on a variety of pre-launch activities for Myflix, including website development, mastering and uploading of titles, long-lead P.R. campaigns, launch ads and videos and strategic positioning and goals. However, for competitive reasons, we cannot publicly disclose more than just these broad strokes at this time. The total inventory of available content from our current suppliers is over 10,000 programs (feature films and or television episodics). About 800 of the initial 2,500 titles set for* *our July 27 launch date* *are already properly formatted / mastered for streaming access. The others will require some degree of mastering attention, most commonly the addition of closed-captions or reformatting into streaming compatible media.* ***(Taken from their blog*** [***http://hannoverhousemovies.blogspot.com/***](http://hannoverhousemovies.blogspot.com/)***)***

Netflix has somewhere between 4-5000 movies for comparison. 30+ suppliers are already signed up for Myflix

Yes, 1&amp;#37; was arbitrary. However I see 1 million users achievable pretty fast? You can use whatever number you prefer but anything above (If I recall it correctly) 15.000 users will make Myflix profitable. So IMO Myflix will make HHSE a lot of money.
