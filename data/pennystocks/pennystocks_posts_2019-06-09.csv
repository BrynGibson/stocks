3,Hide Orders in Etrade?,byjgfb,BootyfulMiami,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/byjgfb/hide_orders_in_etrade/,3,7,"Hey guys.

Does anyone know if it is possible to hide your order size when placing a limit Buy/Sell on Etrade? I love the brokerage but that's one feature from Interactive Brokers that I can't seem to replicate and miss quite a bit.

To be more specific, I mean to apply a 'Hidden' attribute to the order so that it appears as only 500 shares on the level 2 instead of 20,000.",2019-06-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/byjgfb/hide_orders_in_etrade/

 \-Lowered conversion price in the subscription rights offering by 22.5%, and lowered the exercise price of the warrants included in the subscription rights offering by 30% to $3.10. Some readers will remember that the warrants were priced higher then the preferred shares, at $4.40, while the conversion price of the preferred shares was only $4.00. They also lowered the total shares they intended to issue in their most recent S-1 

\- They also issued warrants with an exercise price of $3.10, but whatâ€™s most unusual is that they included a covenant stating that if they sell any shares between now and June. 28, 2019, they will be forced to lower the exercise price of the warrants to $2.25. If you read the prior report we published, you would know that the likelihood of them issuing more stock in that time period is extremely high considering they hired an underwriter to solicit investors to buy their subscription units.
