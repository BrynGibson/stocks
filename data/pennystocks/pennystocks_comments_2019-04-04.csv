&gt; Recently, mega retailer **CVS** announced it has taken the leap and will begin selling CBD products, which prompted Walgreens to follow suit, announcing it will also carry CBD products soon after. This comes after a leading drink manufacturer, **New Age Beverages**, unveiled a new line of cannabis-infused drinks that will utilize the highly recognized name of late reggae star Bob Marley in launching Marley+CBD. PSIQ plans to monitor these trials, set to take place this month to look into how the FDA might legalize CBD-additives in food products. PSIQ stands to benefit significantly from a positive out-come of the trials, which ultimately aim to loosen the constraints of adding cannabis related products to food and drinks.

The stock is not trading up and down enough to day trade it effectively (You can buy at 1.40 and sell at 1.50 only to find in LITERALLY five minutes for it to grow to 1.60) and the company is fighting back tooth and nail to both, combat the allegations that it misled investors which it claims were created by unscrupulous short sellers and it's also sending a message to all the bears and short sellers out there who think the company is not worth its salt.

Before the company was hit by these allegations it was trading very consistently at $11+. Right now it's $1.75 as of writing this. If somehow the company can regain its value by winning the court case and proving it indeed was valued correctly in the past, analysts are estimating that the value of this company's stock could rise anywhere from $8-$11. 

Compare 1.75 to 8 (the low end of the expectations) and determine if this stock is worth investing in. Good luck.",2019-04-04
