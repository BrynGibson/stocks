5,My Penny Stock Watch-List for 4.15.2019 üíµüíµüíØ,bd6401,Transparent_Traders,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bd6401/my_penny_stock_watchlist_for_4152019/,4,8," **Ticker Symbols:**¬†¬†\---&gt; [WATCH-LIST](https://www.transparenttraders.me/2019/04/my-penny-stock-watch-list-for-4152019.html) 

 **Your watch list isn‚Äôt necessarily a list of stocks you have already purchased**; rather, its purpose is to get a good ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for stocks that you are considering purchasing. An active trader that has for example, an average of ten positions at any given time, will usually be watching several stocks as well so that when one position is sold, another one can be purchased immediately from the watch list. This avoids a situation where an investor has too much cash in his or her trading account at any given time.

Using a watch list is convenient for several different purposes; for example, suppose you have researched a company that you consider to be sound, and to have good potential. However, the stock price is currently overvalued, and you want to wait for a more opportune time to buy. The watch list will track the share price, and generate charts to show you the general trend‚Äìso you can predict when would be the best time to purchase the stock.",2019-04-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bd6401/my_penny_stock_watchlist_for_4152019/

8,Help on CPRX,bd1ijq,IrRoscoeMr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bd1ijq/help_on_cprx/,0,6,I bought cprx on a sell off/spike in buy volume at about 3.10. I've been looking for an actual indication of an exit point and I guess I've never bought that low on a runner before or maybe I'm just getting attached. At first I figured if it drops 2% below 5$ (using previous low of days) on high volume. Now I'm at 5.20 within 2% on good volume I sell. Anyone have any other sell indicators they like to use for something that a wedge doesn't really make sense (to me) in this instance. Maybe an EMA or stick with making my own resistances and 2%-3% rule?,2019-04-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bd1ijq/help_on_cprx/
