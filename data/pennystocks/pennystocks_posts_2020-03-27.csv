""Keener operates a business through which he buys convertible notes, a form of short-term debt security, from penny stock issuers in need of cash. 

After holding the notes for approximately six months, Keener converts them into newly issued shares of stock at a deep discount to the prevailing market price, which he negotiates in advance of the purchase, and sells that stock into the market to lock in a profit. 

During the Relevant Period, Keener sold into the  public market more than 17.5 billion newly issued shares of penny stock from convertible notes that he purchased from more than 100 penny stock issuers. 

Keener‚Äôs profits from this practice were approximately $21.5 million, the majority of which came from the spread between Keener‚Äôs discounted acquisition cost for the stock and the prevailing market price.

Since I'm going to invest with small account I cannot afford these courses. So is it possible to get to level of pros and make 15 to 20% profit consistently? I know there is no single trick or strategy but I'm willing to learn and put effort into this stream. Also, anyone on this sub, how did they start from scratch, did they learn by browsing and youtube or they put money into courses? For inspiration, please do you have any success stories?!",2020-03-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fpx1zw/is_it_realistically_possible/

As a new investor I feel like we all will experience and learn from this. IThe goal is to not ever experience it but after being up $400 on AYTU and not selling and then now being -$250 and selling it all I needed to learn this. Though $400 isn't the type of big profit I'm talking about but it is sizable and that's my story. Should of sold when it was looking good instead of waiting until it would look great.,2020-03-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/fprzt0/have_you_ever_missed_out_on_profit_big_time/
