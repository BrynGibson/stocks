Is there anyone here who can help breakdown how ‚Äúbig,‚Äù this news is? Seems to have pulled back a bit for a good buy right now and am long myself, but want to plan an exit outside of technicals since it has high premarket volume and volatility. Here is the news;


      -- PALOMA-3 study gene expression profiling shows that CDK2 
      is a key kinase bypass mechanism 
after 
      treatment with palbociclib plus hormone therapy --
    
    

      -- Cyclin E is proposed as the first predictive biomarker of 
      palbociclib efficacy --
    
    

      
      BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., March 25, 2019 (GLOBE 
      NEWSWIRE) -- Cyclacel 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:CYCC) (Nasdaq:CYCCP) (Cyclacel or 
      the Company), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative 
      medicines based on cancer cell biology, highlighted a paper from 
      independent investigators titled Cyclin E1 Expression and 
      Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor‚ÄìPositive 
      Metastatic Breast Cancer published in the most recent edition of 
      the Journal of Clinical Oncology (Turner N et al, 2019 https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.18.00925). 
      The study findings identify overexpression of cyclin E1 as a mechanism 
      by which breast cancer escapes the effects of palbociclib CDK4/6 
      inhibitor (Ibrance¬Æ) plus fulvestrant treatment. Inhibition of the 
      CDK2/cyclin E complex, the target of Cyclacel‚Äôs CYC065 clinical stage 
      candidate, is proposed as a potential therapeutic approach to prevent 
      early progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors.
    
    

      ‚ÄúThese data from a successful, randomized Phase 3 study identifies 
      cyclin E as a biomarker of resistance of estrogen receptor positive, 
      HER-2 negative breast cancer to palbociclib regimens. This supports and 
      extends previous data showing that cyclin E is a resistance mechanism to 
      HER-2 positive breast and uterine cancer treated with trastuzumab,‚Äù said Spiro 
      Rombotis, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cyclacel. 
      ‚ÄúPreclinical data demonstrated CYC065 activity in cyclin E amplified 
      models of palbociclib-resistant breast cancer. Tumor shrinkage and 
      stable disease were observed in four patients with cyclin E amplified 
      advanced cancers in a first-in-human, Phase 1 study of single agent 
      CYC065. Cyclin E amplified tumors are found in patients with 
      gynecological and other cancers and represent a large, unmet medical 
      need. The findings support CYC065‚Äôs broad therapeutic potential and 
      unique target profile among CDK inhibitors.‚Äù
    
    

      In the PALOMA-3 trial (NCT01942135), patients with endocrine 
      therapy-pretreated, metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive 
      palbociclib + fulvestrant or placebo + fulvestrant. Out of 521 patients 
      treated 302 had tumor tissue analyzed. ¬†Palbociclib efficacy was 
      approximately halved in patients with high compared to low cyclin E1 
      expression in their tumors (median PFS of 7.6 vs. 14.1 months 
      respectively). In contrast to cyclin E1 expression, the analysis showed 
      that expression of cyclin D1, the molecular partner of CDKs 4 and 6 
      which are the targets of palbociclib, or PI3 kinase (PIK3CA) mutations 
      were not predictive of efficacy for palbociclib plus hormone therapy.
    
    

      The findings were further validated through a gene expression analysis 
      of the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) trial in 61 patients with 
      untreated early-stage breast cancer receiving either palbociclib until 
      the day before surgery or no treatment. High cyclin E expression was 
      associated with lower absolute antiproliferative response to palbociclib 
      (high 36%; intermediate 79%; low 80%; P = 0.005). Correlative analysis 
      of PALOMA-3 data has identified cyclin E1 as the first potential 
      biomarker that is predictive of the efficacy of palbociclib.
    
    

      About CYC065
    
    

      CYC065 is a highly-selective, orally- and intravenously-available, 2nd 
      generation inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 2 and 9. CYC065 
      is in an ongoing Phase 1, first-in-human study in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors. In this study target engagement and durable suppression of 
      the Mcl-1 biomarker were observed after a single dose of CYC065. Tumor 
      shrinkage and stable disease were observed in four patients with cyclin 
      E amplified advanced cancers. CYC065 is also being evaluated in a Phase 
      1 study in combination with venetoclax in patients with 
      relapsed/refractory CLL. Preclinical data suggest that CYC065 may 
      benefit patients with adult and pediatric hematological malignancies 
      such as CLL, AML, ALL, B-cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma and certain 
      cyclin E-addicted or MYC-amplified solid tumors, including HER2+ breast 
      cancer, uterine serous carcinoma and neuroblastoma.

From My Nevada County Cannabis Conversation:

Temporary Local Authorization Permit

The Board of Supervisors passed a resolution on October 23, 2018 authorizing the Community Development Agency to establish a pre-application conditional process for temporary local authorization in response to State inquiries regarding cannabis cultivation for State temporary licenses.  Applicants for temporary local authorization shall:

Be in compliance with the County‚Äôs current draft cannabis ordinance.

Demonstrate that no new environmental impacts will occur as a result of the temporary local authorization.

Demonstrate that the applicant will be able to cultivate on the same site and under the same license type as requested in the temporary local authorization, once the County‚Äôs new cannabis cultivation ordinance is adopted.

Recognize that no cultivation or growing will be allowed under the temporary local authorization until the County‚Äôs pending EIR is complete and a new cannabis cultivation ordinance has been adopted and County staff can inspect the property for compliance.

Recognize that the temporary local authorization gives no guarantee or promise that the holder of such local authorization will have the ability to cultivate in the future, obtain an annual state license, or annual local permit.

Recognize that the temporary local authorization may be revoked at any time at the discretion of the Community Development Agency Director.

Once the applicant determines their compliance with all of the above, they will need to submit a complete temporary local authorization application packet. Once the application packet is thoroughly completed and signed it must be sent via email to cannabiscompliance@co.nevada.ca.us or submitted in person at the Rood Government Center's Community Development Agency located at 950 Maidu Avenue, Suite 170 (first floor), in Nevada City.

We look forward to their knowledge, advice and relationships in the medical field as we increase the awareness and distribution of our CBD products.‚Äù

Mr. Jason Winn stated, ‚ÄúI am excited to be part of the Canbiola team and provide my insights on the legal side of health care. My current legal work includes areas affecting health care practitioners and dealings with licensed health care providers. The recent passage of the U.S. Farm Act opens the door for companies such as Canbiola to address a need with CBD products.‚Äù

Dr. Mehran Peter Ghazvini stated, ‚ÄúI am thrilled to join the Canbiola team and lend my many years of medical expertise. As a rehabilitation chiropractor, I am always seeking the latest and greatest methods and medicines to improve patient outcomes and achieve success in restoring a patient‚Äôs functional abilities. I believe Canbiola‚Äôs products, incorporating CBD, enable patient success in chronic pain treatment and rehabilitation.‚Äù

Jason D. Winn, Esquire, is a 1996 graduate of the University of Maryland and received his Juris Doctorate from Nova Southeastern University - Shepard Broad Law in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida in 2000. Mr. Winn was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2001. From 2001 until 2004, Mr. Winn worked for the Assistant Public Defender in the Fifth Judicial Circuit where he conducted over 15 jury trials, numerous non-jury trials, and many hearings including, violations of probation, restitution, and early termination motions for defendants in Juvenile, Misdemeanor and Felony Court.¬†Mr. Winn was also an adjunct professor at Lake Sumter Community College teaching Business Law during this time.¬† In 2003, Mr. Winn was appointed by Governor Bush to serve a one-year term on the Judicial Nominating Commission for Judicial Compensation Judges. From 2004-2006 Mr. Winn worked for the law office of Clyde M. Taylor, Jr. focusing on both state and federal criminal defense and parole violation hearings. Beginning in 2005, he opened his own practice, Winn Law, where he is managing partner and continues to focus on criminal, administrative, governmental, civil, and wills.¬† Mr. Winn currently serves as general counsel for the Florida Osteopathic Medical Association (FOMA), the Florida Podiatric Medical Association (FPMA) and the Florida Society of Hearing Healthcare Professionals (FSHHP).

As a member of the Tallahassee Bar, Mr. Winn volunteers his legal services to the Wakulla County Senior Citizens Center, and Legal Services of North Florida.

Dr. Mehran Peter Ghazvini is a Tallahassee, Florida based male chiropractor who is specialized as a Rehabilitation Chiropractor. Dr. Ghazvini is focused on restoring a patient's functional abilities to pre-injury or pre-disease status. Functional abilities are defined as those activities in one's daily life, work, or sports and recreational activities that an individual participates in. Relevant impairments (e.g. strength, endurance, flexibility, motor control, etc.) are often intermediate goals of rehabilitation, but the final goal of successful care is return to participation in activities in which the patient was successful before the onset of the injury or disease. Essential to a rehabilitation approach is a focus on patient-centered outcomes such as independence and self-management or self-care skills.",2019-03-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b5cyfw/canb_canbiola_appoints_additional_members_to_its/

40,Stock Trading Diary - Week 4,b5hjmf,TheBreadMakerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b5hjmf/stock_trading_diary_week_4/,3,0,"Sorry this is a day or two late this week, had a busy weekend. Really good insightful information this week:

### Week 4

Well... you win some you lose some... this week I lost. Not a good week at all for me, took all losses from each trade I had entered. The one silver lining was I didn't change my strategy or do anything differently than I had the past several weeks. It was just one of those weeks where nothing went my way. Still played stocks with strong support levels, still had very good entries and didn't overpay or chase any of my trades. Just one of those weeks where all trades broke support and stopped me out. There is one key **VERY** bone headed thing I did this week regarding emotions when trading. I will discuss it further in my trade breakdowns below. Let's jump into the tickers and trades I made last week.

These were the tickers I traded for the week of March 18th 2019:

* SFUN
* HOV
* PEIX

Rough week for me. First two trades were just unfortunate stop outs, last one was just emotions taking over and not trading smart which really put me behind the 8 ball after taking that massive of a loss. On that last trade last week, I basically didn't follow any of my rules, good lesson for those of you reading this about how not being strict and emotionless can lead to big or consistent losses.

### Trade Highlights

**SFUN -** This trade I was playing the $1.34 support level the stock had and expecting a bounce to $1.43+. Upon entering the trade at $1.34, I got a nice bounce to $1.39 same day and was feeling pretty confident that the following day this would hit for a nice 5-7% gains. Unfortunately the following day it slid back down to $1.34 and then by end of day it fell under $1.34 to $1.32. After the slide and close below support I was slightly worried, but figured ehh, I have a planned stop loss at $1.29 so minima loss if I stop out. Problem was the day before I had set my stop limit to be good until close, which meant that if the stop loss didn't hit then the order would be cancelled. Usually I set the stop as good until cancelled which means the order will stay until I actually cancel it. Well that hurt me a little in this case as I was away from my computer the day it fell and didn't see it till the stock was down to $1.26. Now that small loss has become a little bigger, I exited at that point and took a bigger loss than I wanted. If you look at SFUN chart you can see how hard it fell after breaking that support level, it went below $1.20.

**HOV -** This trade ended up being somewhat similar to the SFUN trade in that I felt we had a decent support level at $0.575. I entered this trade at $0.58 and saw massive bids at $0.575 which re-established and validated the support level I felt confident in. For about 2 days the stock stayed right at that $0.575 level and was just consistently taking chunks out of that $0.575 level. Finally it broke and the stock had a couple big legs down intraday and my stop hit at $0.55. That trade went about as expected from a breakdown standpoint, I planned an entry at $0.57-$0.58 with a stop at $0.55 and a price target of $0.61. I wasn't super upset with this one as I just chalked it up to one that didn't work out, I followed my strategy, had a good entry, just didn't work.

**PEIX -** This trade was what I like to call **The Ultimate Rule Breaker**. I broke so many of my rules on this trade its almost comical. First, a little background on this trade. This was a trade that I actually missed an entry on Monday from my Watchlist. This one I wanted to enter at $1.11, it opened Monday at $1.12 then proceeded to run up to $1.21 the next day. I was a little upset I missed that trade especially with HOV and SFUN not performing. After I exited SFUN and HOV I was looking for my next trade. Then I saw PEIX had come back down to $1.10 range again, chart still looked very good and I was hungry to recoup my losses from HOV and SFUN, so breaking one of my rules right off the bat, I dump my whole account into this trade. I was thinking man if this goes back to $1.21 I will make back my losses from SFUN and HOV and then some! (So dumb) So I dump about $10,000 into this trade. I planned a stop loss at $1.07 and was looking for $1.20+ as a price target. Stock immediately goes to $1.15 and I find myself up $500 on the trade, this was mistake number two. I am always looking to make 3-5% on each trade. I had it, right in front of me to take. But I wanted to hold for $1.20 so I could bring my account all the way back. (Super dumb) Well, some of you probably know this story all too well. Stock never got above $1.15, faded back to $1.10 and then next day opened at $1.07 and then went to $1.05. Mistake number 3, I had a planned stop loss at $1.07 but once it got to that level I realized I was down a bunch and felt like I should hold for a bounce back. This is also super dumb because I was trading this off technical analysis and a $1.10 support level I had drawn out. So if this stock broke that level, what was I still holding for? Hope? Yup exactly. And if you are holding a stock and the only reason is ""You hope it comes back"" well, buckle up because you are about to go on a fun ride to hell. The stock fell that same day all the way down to $1.02, at this point I am down a lot, mad at myself for taking this ""revenge trade"" and really I figured ok, hard stop at $0.99 see if it can hold up at $1.00, of course it did not and I stopped myself out at $0.99. This trade has so many lessons and mistakes in it that you should be able to live vicariously through me and think to yourself anytime you are holding or trading off of hope or breaking any of your rules.. take a second and think, wow TheBreadMaker lost over $1,000 when doing that, do I want the same thing to happen to me? The answer is No you do not.

### Key Takeaways

I don't have much here for key takeaways as I have already outlined a lot in the above content. What I will say is this, I have been a trader for over 6 years, I have seen and been through a lot. You can see that everyone still will have bad weeks and occasionally get emotional when trading. So it's not just you that feels or gets that one, seasoned pros down to newbie rookies, everyone loses and everyone trades emotionally from time to time. The ones who can keep the losses to a minimum, stick to their rules and control their emotions the best are the ones that come out on top. Most days, weeks, months, years I consider myself to be in that category. This last week I was not. It is always a good learning and humbling lesson to go through and all of these experiences make me a better trader in the long run. Looking forward to bouncing back this upcoming week and getting back on the right track!

Hope you enjoyed reading about my journey for this week. Keep on following and commenting for future weeks. Looking forward to what everyone has to say this week!
