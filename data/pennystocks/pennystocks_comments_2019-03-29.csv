I threw my old goal out the window and decided to wait until 100k or to hold over a year - whichever came first. I started making plans to take leave from my job and finish school. I was on top of the world, but I was irrationally exuberant.

Suddenly the SEC came in and suspended the stock I had the majority of my $ in. Once they let it resume trading (grey market), my gains deflated to 20k. At that point I took the money and ran, but holy shit what a missed opportunity. I never got to go back to school on that cash and used it for down payment on a home. Now I live the frugal life.

To me the most attractive thing about UEX is their deposit is in between Cameco‚Äôs two largest mines in the Athabasca Basin, which produces the highest grade uranium in the world, which is the most sought after. Something else to consider though are the tariffs Trump is supposed to impose on uranium imports to the US. I‚Äôve heard Cameco might be exempt from the tariffs since the amount of uranium mined in the US isn‚Äôt enough to power more than one of their sixty nuclear power plants.

Japan still has another twelve reactors they plan to turn back on since the 2011 shut down. India plans on tripling their nuclear capacity by 2024. In the next few years China will become the biggest consumer of uranium, however they purchase all of their uranium from Kazakhstan (good thing Cameco has a mine there). According to UEX‚Äôs website, Cameco currently owns 18.80% of UEX, down from 20.33%, so it‚Äôs hard for me to say what their next move will be, although I think it‚Äôs very possible for Cameco to eventually buy out UEX.

Pros - no fees
Cons - delayed prices (use a different app for more current prices). Not everything is available to trade. I try to keep it in CAD so i am not losing on the 1.5% exchange as well (which isn't bad). Seems like stocks are easier to find if they are on the TSX anyway.",2019-03-29

I think on the long run UEX will be able to fight for its price. I am hopeful. 

Honestly I am a small player in a big game, a family member told me \~5 years ago about UEX. I have done MAX (in at .6 and out at .7), UEX(in at .18 and still in), and ONC(in at 5, a clear loss). And I want to do MAW around 0.18 and NEXT at 0.08. Thoughts? Do you have any recommendations as well? I am always interested in watching more.

It must be a completely different company that runs all the india locations or how does that work.
