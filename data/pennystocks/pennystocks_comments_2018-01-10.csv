94,Talonx4,dsi263s,/r/pennystocks/comments/7pjfrn/new_trader/dsi263s/,3,"Well... If you do it like the rest of us, you get in high and sell when it crashes. 

All jokes aside, some tips are:

Buy when the stock breaks the 52 week high.

Buy when the stock is at the support point.  

Sell before you hit the resistance point.

Sell if it crashes under support.  

Realistically, you can make a calender of when stocks will release earnings and if they have done well on previous earnings, buy a week before they release, and sell right after they release.  

There are a ton of strategies and each trader does their own style of trading.  You just have to find yours.  ",2018-01-10
