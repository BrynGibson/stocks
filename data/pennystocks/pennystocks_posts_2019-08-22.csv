The company is one of the few companies on otc making real money (8.3 mill in revenue, constant growth over three years), plans to uplist later this year, etc.

They hit a high of $2 before converting notes and diluting from 8mill shares to 28mil. Now it's at a penny and will have a stop sign until the first 10q is ready. Just a heads up if you want these shares for cheap before it spikes. Do your dd of course.. But I've gotten good info from this sub before and I share when I get info too.

Full disclosure: I do have a fair amount of shares at a low price, but ivd been a long for six months with these guys.. Sold half my shares at $2..and stocked up on the penny ones and plan to hold long again :)",2019-08-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ctqcdi/fles_has_posted_their_10k_after_hours_today/

Anaheim, CA, Aug. 22, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LiveWire Ergogenics, Inc. (OTC: LVVV) announced today that it is has recently filed its Second Quarter 2019 Financial Report with OTC Markets.  


LiveWire Ergogenics, through its subsidiary GHC Ventures, generated $371,876 in revenue, a significant improvement over the same period last year. The increase in revenue of over 2000% is a result of State licensed Distribution and Nursery operations in California. General and Administrative costs increased slightly to $176,571, due to the additional personnel to manage GHC operations.  At the same time, the Company has been able to reduce its stock-based compensation significantly and did not issue any new shares during the second quarter of 2019, keeping down dilution for our existing shareholders.

Bill Hodson, CEO of LiveWire stated, “To continue this path of aggressively increasing revenues, we have substantially expanded the operation of our subsidiary, GHC Ventures, and have implemented an all-encompassing software tracking system to capture all transactions. The system allows us to track and trace every transaction and comply with California State and tax authorities’ rules and regulations that come along with this growing industry. Below you will find a summary of all milestone achievements within our group of companies for the last few months that we believe will have a positive impact in the months ahead.”

1. Finalized acquisition of a 265-acre Ranch in Paso Robles, California via our subsidiary to establish the world’s first Estate Grown Weedery.
2. Received cultivation/nursery and distribution permits for nursery in Coachella, California.
3. Received cultivation/nursery Minor Use Permit for its nursery in Paso Robles, California.
4. Received Annual CA State distribution license from the California Bureau of Cannabis Control.
5. Began operation of statewide distribution division GHC Ventures for distribution of cannabis products throughout California.
6. Applied for Minor Use Permit for outdoor cultivation  on Estrella Ranch.

20,$SHIP is heading into a bullish Q3 and Q4 fundamentally and technically speaking,cu3rg4,born2rock4life,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cu3rg4/ship_is_heading_into_a_bullish_q3_and_q4/,5,4,"Hey folks,

I usually lurk the forums and occasionally post my due diligence which predicates on analyzing both fundamentals and technicals for stocks, as well as critiquing stocks posted here in efforts to advocate and/or educate potential traders/investors on the risks and rewards respectively.

My former call-outs for $HSGX doing merger arbitrage based on the previous filings allowed for gains over 100% within short time-spans, and can be found scrolling back in the history here.

That said, I'll get to the meat and potatoes of the post..

Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. is a maritime shipping company with 10 Capesize vessels in their fleet, which is set-up for a nice run both on fundamentals and also due to momentum given their market cap (\~$15.1m,) and low public float (\~14m shares public, \~24.5m overall shares.) This makes liquidity less ideal for day-trading without above average volume, thus making it higher risk, but much higher reward.

Shipping prices for maritime fleets have hit multi-year highs. This is due to the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI,) and Baltic Dry Index (BDI,) hitting multi-year highs which serves as the price index for maritime shipping companies.

The Iron Ore demand is also up again due to Vale companies Brumadinho mine coming back online which impacts $SHIP particularly given that is one of their primary transports.

Per the CEO in their recent 6-K filing he has clarified the boost in revenue for Q3 will be substantial due to these factors by stating; “Since the beginning of the third quarter of 2019, 62% of our fleet available days have been fixed at a daily TCE of approximately $23,800 per ship per day, marking an increase of 184% as compared to the fleet average TCE rate of $8,368 in the first half of 2019.”

Another key factor is also the demand being higher than usual as many fleets are having ships out-of-service while getting fuel scrubbers installed to meet emissions requirements for the IMO 2020 standard which takes effect January 1st, 2020. This is why I foresee this trend holding through Q3 and most of Q4.

I intend to carry most of my shares into Q3 Earnings and likely Q4 Earnings. The major deciding factor for speculation beyond that will be reliant on the BCI/BDI shipping rates hold near the multi-year highs, as well as factoring in for the companies ability to lock-in the pricing per their contracts with the charterer's who are utilizing $SHIP's vessels.

Best of luck to all those investing here or with other companies.",2019-08-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/cu3rg4/ship_is_heading_into_a_bullish_q3_and_q4/
