So this video was not planned to be made while this searched question wasn’t in my keyword analysis list, but thank you “pennystocks” redditor  [**u/aaronhlin**](https://www.reddit.com/user/aaronhlin)  who asked me to do this. I think this video will deliver very useful information for those who are interested to swing trade penny stocks.

As well in this video, I will show you my full swing trading screener inputs. Last time I did the video “how to find penny stocks” and I actually gave away the basic inputs I use to build my penny stock screeners, but in this video I thought to myself “what the heck” let’s give away all inputs so those who are interested will at least have easier starting point by knowing how to find volatile penny stocks to swing trade. Hope you will use it well and this information will help you build your trading process further or at least it will give you some ideas on how to build your own screener.

WATCH VIDEO: [https://youtu.be/j4vIQnzZA9g](https://youtu.be/j4vIQnzZA9g)

NOW LET’S START answering the question.

So let’s first separate ways how to swing trade penny stocks. First, you can short sell penny stocks and really it is one of the most profitable ways to make money in this niche. And I know some of you may not be familiar with short selling. In short, short selling is more complex trade when you try to profit from falling prices. I will not get in the specifics about short selling, but I will cover it in the future video.

SWING TRADE PENNY STOCS by SHORT SELLING THEM

In order to have stock that we could potentially short sell, we first would need to find one. This is where stock screener comes into play. I use volatility to find penny stocks to short sell or to buy. To simplify the explanation for volatility \- it is security’s price change over time. Basically, I look for micro and nano cap stocks that are trading on average 300k shares per day (I am interested only in liquid stocks), which gained more than 50&amp;#37; per month and which price is above by 50&amp;#37; from 50 simple moving average to help me filter out possible ideas. 

Why am I interested in stocks that gained more than 50&amp;#37; per month and which prices are above by 50&amp;#37; from their 50 simple moving average? The answer is due to well know assumption called mean reversion. Mean reversion is the assumption that stock’s price will tend to move to its average price over time. To simply put if we here are looking at stocks that gained \+50&amp;#37; in one month we can assume that some of them will reverse back to its price mean over time. So basically if the stock rose quickly in price it will probably drop back in similar fashion.

Ok, so with the help from the screener we can filter out possible trading ideas to short sell by having a list of stocks to choose from. What should we do next? This is when we must do our due diligence on stocks from the screener’s list to find out which stock we would like to bet on. This is the part where you should start doing technical and fundamental analyses. These analyses will help to determine which stock is the best candidate to short sell.

When it comes to technical analysis my main focus is to find the stock that is trading near resistance level, because resistance level is great price level where a short seller can better position themselves. As well I do VSA analysis which I will not explain here but this analysis helps me understand stock price in relation to its volume. I basically like to find the stock that trades near resistance level with diminishing volume near this level and which price seems will not break the resistance level. Now from technical standpoint this is my main interests to observe in a potential candidate to swing short sell.

What about fundamentals? While I would not be able to write this section without expanding a lot I will only summarize the main points:

1.    Look for worsening or already awful financial performance. 

2.    Look for a history of stock dilution and reverse splits.

3.    Look if the stock is not complying with stock exchange listing rules.

4.    Look for previous misconducts by the company and its management.

These are the main fundamental attributes I would like to find if I am interested in short sell particular micro or nano cap stock aka penny stock. There are more things to share but this post is already getting already long and as well I do not think too much information is helpful if it is not put in practice. So if it is something new start digging deeper to understand why these fundamentals matter for short sellers.

Just to finish here most of the time I exit my swing short sell trade when the stock price reaches its short term exponential moving average (8EMA) on a daily chart or sometime on weekly chart. But you can use other short term moving averages as well. This is just what I use, but 10 MA in the example can as well good for helping you exit short swing trade.

SWING TRADE PENNY STOCKS by BUYING THEM

To start here I would really like to warn you here that I rarely buy penny stocks (it seems for me it is way harder to do this and be profitable), but when I do I can make three times the amount what I can make when short selling penny stocks. As well I need to deepen my own research into building a better system to swing trade penny stocks to the upside. 

But as of now, I can share some information that helped me nail few great swing trades.

Now I use the same screener to find potential buying opportunities. I just love volatility. I hate putting money in the stock that doesn’t move. 

What I am first looking for when buying penny stocks to swing trade is a price pullback and then impulsive move to the upside accompanied by increased and bigger volume. What I am trying to find here is momentum in stock price. The main buy signal for me is when I see genuine breakout pattern in stock. I want to see bigger than usual volume accompanied with price break above at least minor recent resistance level with price closing above it to confirm a genuine breakout.

But this doesn’t end here while most of the time what these micro and nano cap stocks do they just do not follow through and price do not go further to realize at least notable profits. 

What I found really help here is again fundamentals. I only have two noticeable fundamental attributes I want to share with you:

1.    Try to pick the stock that recently got some great news related to the possible future revenue increase. Be sure that news is legit.

2.    But the most influential fundamental attribute you should be seeking is a major improvement in financial performance. Watch the video to see $REN example.
