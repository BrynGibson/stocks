They submited to EU a loan of 2.5m euros and we dont know whats going on with that, for all we know they are going to use the profits if the loan isnt approved as a backup plan for the expansion plan, or use both to cut time. Thats what i would do at least, check em out its pretty dope how much good news has been coming over the last 6 months, and how quiet theyve been, something is coming but again, thats just me.
