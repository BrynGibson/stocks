3,Zero Commission Question,ddvrg6,dannyb1027,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddvrg6/zero_commission_question/,16,8," I'm currently on Webull and very new to trading. 

Is anyone thinking of going to E Trade over TD? If so Why? I'm going back and forth trying to pick. E trade offers volume Discounts on OTCs ( $4.95 per trade after 30 trades in a quarter ) but you get web only platform.

TD think or swim gives you full platform access but no Volume discount.",2019-10-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ddvrg6/zero_commission_question/
4,Looking for alpha testers for a real time breakout alert system.,de7cfs,RocketingStocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/de7cfs/looking_for_alpha_testers_for_a_real_time/,62,135,"I'm looking for some Alpha testers for a website that I am working on.  It lists out in real time penny stocks that are about to break out, stocks that are oversold, stocks that are prime for a swing or bounce, stocks with upcoming earnings, stocks that are at support levels, and ones that have hit new 52 week highs.  It uses some patterns and actual strategies that we have had a lot of success with.  

I'm interested in honest feedback.   No, I don't need your credit card number or any information.  And yes of course it's free since I am the one asking for your help!   Let me know if you are interested and I'll PM you the details. I'm not trying to advertise anything, I'm just looking for your honest feedback. 

Eventually I'd like to have it also do algorithm trading and have it make trades automatically, but it needs to be tested, fine tuned, and adjusted with more catagories, options and settings.  I'm currently working on apps for both Android and IOS, but it's only a website for now.  No OTCs yet.  So it's limited to NASDAQ.  Robinhood and webull users should be able to trade any stock that comes up.  

Thanks everyone, and happy trading.",2019-10-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/de7cfs/looking_for_alpha_testers_for_a_real_time/

6,FDA: Investigational New Drug (IND) study approved to move forward. NFL and the US Navy are on board.,de62rd,IRChristo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/de62rd/fda_investigational_new_drug_ind_study_approved/,1,0,"Some of my friends know about my interest and investment in stem cell technology. Because of their original patents on the harvesting, growth, storage, and shipping of a person's own stem cells collected from their own body's fat, I zero'd in on American Cryostem as the winner both for medical treatment for myself and for investment growth. I have invested steadily beginning in 2014.

American Cryostem (CRYO) is now the only FDA authorized company in this field of research and getting to this point has taken years.

Now that their investigational new drug (IND) clinical trial is FDA approved for exploration into the treatment of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and post concussive syndrome (PCS), other researchers with interests in treating other maintenance and surgical remedies for the body will be able to piggyback their studies onto the CRYO clinical trial, using American Cryostem's (CRYO) stem cell products, of course.

The NFL players association and the US Navy (Marines) are commiting injured members to participate in this study. When this study is completed, every football player and every combat soldier will be banking stem cells for future repairs.

My expectation is that American Cryostem (CRYO) will be a $10 stock within 3 years -- a 20 to 1 return. I am sharing this information, not selling. In December, I will have been invested with this company for the past 5 years. This stock can still be purchased for $.50.

Following is a press release from American Cryostem, this week. It is long but if you've an interest in reading further, here it is:

Working with this expert team will expand the Company’s knowledge for treating concussion injury, traumatic brain injury and Post Concussion Syndrome and accelerate its ability to complete this Phase 1 study and provide the necessary input to continue our work toward final FDA approval of ATcell for Post Concussion Syndrome.
