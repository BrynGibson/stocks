Now with vbiv, I have had some luck with calls but only when we are in between News. This stock is like a toothy blowjob. The days where the news they release is good, the stock drops abit. It's hard to time and price this stock

The delisting occurred due to a plant fire - not the usual slow spiral penny death - 50M in insurance expect 20 to 25 for the payout.  Only 20% of the plant affected. 

Only needs 10 days above the 1.00 mark in the next 180 days for meeting the minimum requirements - no problem in 90 days much less 180. .

So link your source - or retract.
