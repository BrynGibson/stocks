NEW YORK, Feb. 8, 2019

NEW YORK, Feb. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- [VNUE](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2370222-1&amp;h=2958177216&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vnue.com%2F&amp;a=VNUE), Inc. (OTCQB:  VNUE) announced today that for the first time ever, the company is partnering with Radio Hall of Fame member Bob Kingsley, of [Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2370222-1&amp;h=2651070504&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ct40.com%2F&amp;a=Bob+Kingsley%27s+Country+Top+40).

The 8th annual Acoustic Alley performance is one of the most anticipated CRS after-hours events.

""I have been fortunate enough to witness countless live concerts throughout my career, and nothing can replace those memories,"" said Bob Kingsley. ""But thanks to Set.fm, we can offer something better - the ability for attendees to relive this night for years to come.""

""We are very excited to be working with country radio icon Bob Kingsley, and to be introducing our high-quality instant recordings and technology to a Nashville audience,"" said Zach Bair, CEO of VNUE.  ""Acoustic Alley is truly unique in that the event features master songwriters performing their creations, and we will be there to capture every note of these very special performances.""

Soundstr MRT will also assist radio stations and these other businesses negotiate fairer licensing fees. 

CRS is held at the Omni Hotel, in Nashville, Feb. 13-15, 2019.  ""Bob Kingsley's Acoustic Alley"" will be held on Thursday, Feb. 14 from 7 p.m. until midnight in the Legends Ballroom (level 2) at The Omni in Nashville, TN. A CRS badge is required for admittance.

&amp;#x200B;

So as a new trader and investor, I have been going through a bunch of websites trying to learn whats what and how to do what. Don't get me wrong there is some excellent places but none that I feel has a serious attitude out there. I wanted to make a community of investors that was slightly more serious and helpful where beginners can learn and experts have in-depth discussions.

I want a place with easy to find terms and definitions in the ""General"" section where advanced traders and investors can put them in layman's terms while having active weekly discussions in the ""News"" sections where I would maintain and clean out the ""old"" news and keep the news section fresh and relevant so it is easier to navigate. 

The Website currently just acts as a link to the forum but it will advance in the future once I learn what specific type of community I get and possibly how to add the forum directly into the website. I have a vision but will listen to input and advice. 

There is no ads or any profit making content on it 

The website is very basic but as the forum grows the main site will as well.

**Authority National Supply (ANS) adds Four New Members in First Sixty Days Since Being Acquired by Innovest**

CLEVELAND, Feb. 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovest Global Inc. (OTC Markets: IVST) (the ""Company"" or ""Innovest""), a conglomerate with operations in commercial and industrial products and services, biotechnology, construction and building materials, continues exceptional organic growth, this time announcing that its Construction &amp; Building Materials Division, anchored by ANS, closed four new members in January and February, adding an expected $5.2 million dollars in revenue for 2019.  


ANS added a single new client in the previous two years, and this announcement is exactly the growth track ANS CEO Tony Crookston and Innovest president Damon Mintz envisioned when the acquisition closed. “Starting the year with four new members representing 17% revenue growth is exactly the Innovest model as I’ve come to know it,” said Crookston. “Innovest is focused on growth, and strength, and working with me to make the ANS vision a reality. I’m impressed and couldn't be happier with our initial progress.” These early gains support Innovest’s guidance released last week of 20% organic growth to $50 million in gross company sales for 2019, and strongly reinforce Innovest’s focus on adding value to the company.

The new, proudly-welcomed members are Prairie State Exteriors, 55 Building Supply, Butler County Edge Co, and Acorn Roofing Supply. Brent Fening, owner of Butler County Edge, stated, ""After 20 years of being in business, one of the hardest aspects of staying profitable is the ability to compete with the larger roofing distributors.  We are very excited to join ANS. We look forward to working with a group of businesses like our own to increase our purchasing power and strengthen our business.""

The “Source of Strength” is a philosophy at Innovest which places a focus on making its subsidiaries as strong as possible, resulting in their success and therefore Innovest’s success.
