Is this normal?",d0pbgz,raoulduke415,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/d0pbgz/snrg_sold_at_18_but_didnt_show_up_on_the_charts/,12,5,"I had bought a ton of SNRG stock at .10 last week. Put in a sell limit at .18 (good until cancelled). When I saw that it hit .07 this morning I was sort of annoyed, went to work, and got a notification at work that my sell order of 14,000 shares went through for .18 cents.
