I really wish I'd have spent some more time doing this.

And while you do that, think about what sort of investor you are. Do you see yourself buying something that you believe in and have put much research into (going long / buy-and-hold strategy)? Or do you see yourself placing trades in the shorter term, following technical signals on charts, etc? 

I'd encourage you to research some companies online (plenty of stock screeners around) and search for them on Twitter. See how active their CEOs are, and try to see if real people (not just bots and shit) are following them and pay attention to what they are saying about these companies (some will be sharing news, some will share charts, etc). You'll start finding some genuine folks &amp; also those who want to deceive you, especially in pennies... Tread lightly and watch for patterns.

Lots of great resources on Investopedia which will help with getting around the terminology.

But especially if your financial situation is rather precarious (which it is), then I would begin by dipping your feet into paper trading.

You can also hit me up on Twitter here, and I am happy to chat via DM...  @thegreeenknight (notice the three ""e's"").

Good luck!",2018-05-14

16,humbletradesman,dyy0wgj,/r/pennystocks/comments/8j9491/22yo_at_his_dads_house_with_barely_any_underwear/dyy0wgj/,1,"No not at all, I think it’s good that you got the thought to invest and do something with your money to try to grow it. What I was saying was that penny stocks aren’t necessarily the best thing to start with.. they are mostly scams (regardless of the hopes and dreams people will try to sell you regarding any particular ticker/company being pumped here on Reddit or elsewhere) and you can lose all of your money very, very quickly. They seem lucrative at first glance because they’re so ‘cheap’, but there’s a reason they’re cheap.

Jokes aside, you wanna do some reading (investopedia is a great resource to start with) and understand the basics of how the market works, how to read charts, etc... and just start watching and keeping an eye on the markets and some stocks of your choice (use an app like Yahoo finance for example). You also wanna figure out if you want to TRADE or INVEST (there’s a big difference and you can google around to find out)... and then develop your knowledge based on that.

You can also do ‘paper trading’ which is basically trading real stocks with fake money. There are a few apps for this and if you open a brokerage account with TD ameritrade (don’t even need to deposit anything or just a few dollars), you can use their infamous ‘thinkorswim’ platform that a lot of experienced traders like to use and it allows you to log-in to ‘paper trade’ and you can trade to your heart’s content without losing real money. This is how you can learn how everything works and what making/losing money with trading can potentially look like.

Once you understand the basics.. you can start to carefully play with some of your real money and try to slowly build it up. Best wishes for you man and hope to see some success stories from you posted here in the future!

P.S. check out some other investing/stock related subs on Reddit and read up there also, don’t limit yourself to this sub only. Again I’ll reiterate that pretty much every stock being talked about here is generally garbage and a scam waiting to separate the unsuspecting trader from their money.",2018-05-14

100,vytasmike,dz05ovu,/r/pennystocks/comments/8jemqm/how_to_trade_penny_stocks_what_beginner_needs_to/dz05ovu/,1,"That is great answer from beetfrace. As well you need to contact more brokers and advisers to help you sell it or at least point in the direction what you should do to sell it. 

As well you can try to sell it to the company's insiders if it is possible, because insiders from time to time buy their own stock for various purposes.

As well ask maybe someone in charge from your company if there is investor who is interested in company's stock sertificates.

It probably will not be so easy to get rid of this stock certificate while this is real OTC and you need to find willing buyer by yourself or with the help from intermediaries.

But in order to sell something you need to make offer to as many possible prospects as possible to sell it, there is no other way around.

Good luck!",2018-05-14

Where they were converting notes coupled with the #s of 6s that sold - I did not presume it would stay above these levels long. Don’t usually see tickers stay above levels 2x where it converts notes without falling back down. It experienced resistance later in the day today. Staying away from it and I’m comfortable watching others gain there if it continues. GL,2018-05-14
