Ergo you can trade any domestic stocks on their platform. Can't speak to stocks traded on international exchanges, but if you're just getting into it those are probably best to avoid.

Also, tread carefully taking advice on what stocks to invest in here. Most posters have their own agenda (including me, I made a stock post recently) and will try to pump stocks they're personally invested in.

This is fine, but the stocks that get the most attention tend to be the ones currently on 'runs' with a lot of potential to lose their gains.

My best advice starting out would be never buy into a stock that's up 100% or more in the past 30 days. This will help you about pump and dumps. Once you get a better feel for trading you'll know when you can break this rule.

Hope this helps. Cheers! ",2018-03-12

Benchmark Drug Facts as per Investor Presentation Lead Drug:
Applicable Exert: On December 31, 1998--soon after the merger's demise--the FDA approved a new Searle drug, Celebrex, for the treatment of arthritis pain and inflammation. This was the first of a new category of pain drugs, dubbed Cox-2 inhibitors, to be approved. Cox-2, an enzyme present in various diseases, was blocked by the new drugs. As a treatment for arthritis, Celebrex was noted for being effective and for not irritating the stomach. Searle partnered with Pfizer for the global marketing and distribution of Celebrex. Launched in the United States in February 1999, Celebrex became the most successful pharmaceutical launch in U.S. history, with 19 million prescriptions written in the first 12 months; sales during 1999 alone exceeded $1.4 billion. With 43 million Americans suffering from arthritis, and hundreds of millions worldwide, sales of Celebrex were predicted to reach $3 billion annually by 2002.""

The chart looks that way because the share structure of the company has changed dramatically over a short period of time (5 years), and since then the company has a) reverse split their float to make shareholders positions worth less, and b) issued a buttload more shares onto the market to raise funds or dilute debt with financiers.
