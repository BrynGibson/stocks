**The Skinny**

* SURG shares are massively undervalued relative to recent and forward dependable growth rates.
* The company’s model is hitting an inflection that will spur up to 5000% topline growth over coming quarters as an exponential compounding process takes hold.
* The market has failed to appreciate this dynamic because it doesn’t understand the model.. but it will understand the numbers when they hit.
* Investors need to get involved ahead of that because chasing a stock after concrete proof has a poor track record.",2020-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eupelx/surg_getting_big_volume_whats_going_on_with_it/
1,VBIV Hold or Dump,euoq12,Rcturbos,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/euoq12/vbiv_hold_or_dump/,1,11,"So I got in on VBIV at $1.90 (rookie should've noticed it was the peak), at this point I'm debating about just taking my loss and dropping it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you hold and wait for it to come back up, or just drop it and take a loss? I currently have \~200 shares, but volume keeps dropping and doesn't look promising, so my gut says drop it before I lose more?",2020-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/euoq12/vbiv_hold_or_dump/

9,UAMM round 2. Company getting active,eury8j,paulydaniels,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eury8j/uamm_round_2_company_getting_active/,1,1,"Review the chart... significant volume lately.

Lots and lots of eyes and chatter which is imperative for the explosive runs.

Company updated the Bitkam website and their own over the weekend signaling some excitement as these guys NEVER PUMP.  They bought back shares a little over a yr ago and have not issued any shares nor do they have preferred shares.

Again .. for me... that is maybe the first and most important thing I look for.  Share structure and who is abt to dump on me.  In this case... noone.  Its poker at a casino.. just outplay the table.

Good luck!",2020-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eury8j/uamm_round_2_company_getting_active/

As of right now between my E*TRADE, TDA, &amp; Robinhood account, I am up approximately $6,000 or avg 250%

I would like some advice as to where to go from here.... I am thinking about going to see a financial advisor to get some more “professional” help understanding long term &amp; short term capitol gains. 

Also I’m not sure about when is the right time/ right way to “take profits”? 

I’m too scared to flip my current positions for more shares.... but I could have 3x the amount of shares if I had flipped last week... 


I fully expect myself to turn my initial small investment into minimum $150,000...  I’ve just been playing it safe tbh. 

Any and all input/advice is appreciated...",2020-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/eur7tv/new_to_investing_ish/
