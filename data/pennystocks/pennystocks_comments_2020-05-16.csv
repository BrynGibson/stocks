- No debt
- No insider selling
- Enough cash on hand to operate for 3 years regardless of revenue.
- Increasing number of institutional investors including Vanguard, Barclays, Fidelity etc.
- 100% accurate Covid-19 test as validated by multiple independent certified labs.
- US based company with production capacity of 6 million tests per week.
- Currently shipping to 50 countries and 15 U.S. states
- 71.5% gross margin
- A price point that is a small fraction of its competitors.
- A reliable and proven PCR test which tells you if you have the virus now (critical for opening businesses, schools and entertainment venues) unlike an antibody test which can only tell you if you had it no less than 5 days ago (that's how long it takes to develop antibodies, during which time you can spread the virus).
- A unique patented technology that is platform for OralDNA PCR saliva test which will likely be the first FDA approved saliva test available from a publicly traded company. (Royalties!) This game changing test has already been validated by certified labs for the Minnesota Department of Health. 
- A new ETF filed with the SEC, VIRS, which will include CODX among its top ten holdings. 
- Joint venture in India with local manufacturing of 20,000 test kits per day (1.3 billion people and massive government Covid-19 stimulus package). 
 Guidance for a likely sale of 26 million tests in US for Q1 and Q2 alone which, by my math supports a conservative share price of roughly $57.
- Meanwhile, serious epidemiologist say that there will be no reliable vaccine for 18 to 24 months and CODX top competitors are clearly not meeting requirements of accuracy and production output.

I would just use multiple sources, including this subreddit, Twitter, and various trading discords to see what’s being talked about and use that as a starting point. Sorting by New helps me too to get stuff that hasn’t blown up too much. 

Don’t believe every post you see. 

Don’t get greedy. Every investment won’t be a 100% gain aka doubling your money. Sometimes it’s better to settle for 10% and 20% gains, rather than waiting too long and watching a stock tank and ending up with a loss.

That being said, I try not to invest any money in penny stocks that I don’t mind losing. I have taken some wins, but also some losses, but learned along the way.

Interestingly also I read that they have over $3 billion worth of real estate in the form of stores, warehouses, etc. which could provide liquidity should they need it and is very similar to what Sears did.

I’ll let you google “what is a 13F”, but nobody who knows where to look for that DOESN’T know it’s outdated information by months. 

I don’t know if you’ve been browsing the sub for long, but if you have you’ve already seen the exact same behavior for UAVS and MVIS. Now it’s KTOV. If you haven’t browsed for long, just watch the sub everyday for a month and sort posts by new before you take anyone’s stock advice. Otherwise you’ll be sitting with 10-20% of your money left in a week because you got caught up in the hype.",2020-05-16

Stop loss. You set a price and if the price falls to that it auto sells (as long as someone is buying). 

Trailing stop loss. If the price falls a certain percent below the high it will auto sell. Let’s say you buy at $1 and set a trailing stop loss of 25%. The price rises to $2 and begins to fall. When it hits 25% less than the high ($2 in this scenario) which is $1.60 it will trigger a sale. 

Limit sell. You set an upper limit, when it hits that mark it auto sells. So if you buy for $1 and set a limit sell of 1.50 whenever the price hits $1.50 it’ll sell.

Also, GNUS is pretty unique amongst penny stocks right now. Most are extremely volatile pharmaceutical pennies that rise and fall based off rumors of COVID-19 treatment/support. 

However, GNUS is a penny entertainment stock - not very common. They've sucked for several years, but they have official, actual, legitimate products coming out next month and this fall (streaming service, toys, etc.).

One probably won't even blink at the loss, the other is going to post on Reddit about it.

There's a part of me that believes everyone here knows what they're getting into and is an adult that can decide on their own to try to hop on and off a pump without losing money, so I shouldn't feel bad about taking advantage of it. Ultimately, I feel better not being part of it.

The analysis here is mostly based on rumors, tweets, and articles from obscure news sources, with a thick coat of confirmation bias. People pile in their money hoping to win the lottery, trying to hide the true motive of making a quick buck behind Real Confidence in a company. Those that make a few dollars talk about the key is to get out early. Those left holding bags talking about their betrayal and loss. Wash, rinse, repeat.

All the time spent waiting to hop on the next pump and hoping to hop off before the dump could be spent learning how to profit from quality companies. Yes, some of these will go on to be profitable, successful companies, but most of them will not. It's the reason their shares have so little value.

""During the three month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit of $29,973. The Company has financed its operations mainly through fundraising from various investors.

 

See Note 7 for a subsequent event, which resulted in additional cash proceeds to the Company in an amount of approximately $4,300. The Company’s management expects that the Company will continue to generate losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. Based on the projected cash flows and cash balances as of March 31, 2020, management is of the opinion that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 

Management’s plans include the continued commercialization of the Company’s products and securing sufficient financing through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. Additional funds may not be available when the Company needs them, on terms that are acceptable to it, or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in commercializing its products and securing sufficient financing, it may need to cease operations.""

Once the stock dips near this level of support and shows signs of a reversal, I then look at other indicators like RSI and SMA lines as well as candlestick formations to determine whether or not it’s worth buying and will come back up, or if it’s doomed to drop even lower. Low RSI, and candlesticks that break above the short term SMA line while dipping to the consistent level of support gives a high probability of an increase in my eyes. That and the volume. Granted I rarely have huge runs with this strategy, but I’d rather have a bunch of good small runs than to chase a big one and lose profit. It’s probably not a perfect method but it works for me. I suggest practicing observing a few stocks and seeing if you can spot when a stock is gonna go back up (even if it’s very very short term and temporary).",2020-05-16

Look up how to read SEC filings and financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement). YouTube or investopedia can help.

Now you can look for SEC filings and start to understand what they mean. I usually use yahoo to look at a companies financial reports, dividend history, and charts.

(IMHO - We’re in for a bumpy ride for sure - just not on Great Depression level)

3 Reasons This Recession Won’t Be Worse than the Great Depression

Many readers have probably seen the headlines and stories claiming this recession could be as bad – or worse – than the Great Depression. To that I say, don’t take the bait.

The Great Depression was a slow, long, grinding downturn for the U.S. economy. From 1929 to 1933, the economy shrank for 43 consecutive months, with unemployment hovering around 25% for years. Even as the jobs picture improved over the course of the decade, unemployment remained over 10%.

In the coming month, it looks like U.S. unemployment could push past 20% (it stood at 14.7% in April data).1 It’s this piece of data that is drawing the biggest comparison to the Great Depression, but I think the argument is misguided and incomplete. I don’t see this recession coming close to the Great Depression in terms of severity or duration, and I’ll give you three reasons why.


1. Unemployment Figures Do Not Paint a Complete Picture

The U.S. economy is losing millions of jobs – there is no sugar coating this fact. But if we take a very close look at the job losses across the economy, we find that a large percentage are furloughs (temporary layoffs) as opposed to permanently shrinking the workforce (data below):


Source: : Zacks Investment Research3

In the current environment, employers appear to be keeping employees close by, in anticipation of the economy’s reopening. A recent survey conducted by Morning Consult found that two-thirds of workers believed that they would return to work for their current employer, which could help restart business much more quickly than if the employer had to rehire.4 When employees are asked to return to work, there’s no need for training, recruitment, job search, background checks, ‘onboarding,’ etc., all of which are costly and time-consuming. Workers can return to their jobs and immediately be productive.

Additionally, more than half of job losses have come from hospitality, accommodation, food services, retail trade and other service-sector jobs. Those who can work remotely – typically in high-skilled, higher-income jobs in tech, finance, management, professional services – saw a much smaller change to payrolls in March and April. The implication here, in my view, is that the majority of layoffs come from industries that could resume operations immediately when lockdowns and restrictions are lifted – which is beginning to happen now.

Jobs disappeared during the Great Depression because there was no demand, no capital, no functioning Federal Reserve or financial system. Companies had to permanently restructure – or declare bankruptcy – in droves. There was no safety net during the Great Depression.

Today, businesses are struggling in major ways, but they are also receiving financial support from the government with payroll loans that are in many cases forgivable, and workers across many industries are seeing close to full replacement of income from unemployment insurance under the CARES Act.5 This is not a Depression-like outcome.

2. Event-Driven Shock Versus a Structural/Financial Crisis

The collapse of the financial system was one of the major causes of the Great Depression. Today, banks are very well capitalized and the credit markets remain stable. Comparing the financial system during the Great Depression to the financial system today is essentially comparing night to day.

Because the causes of the Great Depression were structural, industrial production fell by more than half during the entirety of the 1930’s. Back then, industrial production was a critical component of the economy. Production trickled higher over a four-year stretch during the mid-1930’s, only to plummet sharply again in 1937-1938.6 Again, the Great Depression was a long, grinding decline. The current lapse in production and services is expected to last a few quarters – not years.

Historically, “event-driven” bear markets (which is how I would characterize the current downturn) have been shorter, less severe, and take less time to recover from than structural or cyclical downturns. I do not believe this time will be different.


Source: : Goldman Sachs7

3. Policy Mistakes Drove the Great Depression Deeper

Governments and central banks failed miserably in their response to the Great Depression, doing basically the opposite of what needed to be done.

In the midst of the 1930’s downturn, central banks tightened monetary policy in order to maintain the gold standard, resulting in severe deflation which raised the cost of debt and lowered real incomes. The U.S. government equally fumbled the response by putting austerity measures in place (cutting spending) just as the economy needed it most. The government also passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 in an effort to help domestic producers, but it only resulted in more pain due to the loss of global demand.

The policy response in the current crisis has drawn from lessons learned during the Great Depression, and the government and central bank are essentially doing the opposite of what they did during the Depression. The U.S. government has spent some $2.9 trillion in stimulus to boost the economy, and the Federal Reserve slashed rates to the zero bound in addition to offering basically unlimited liquidity to the capital markets.8 The difference in responses is night and day.

Bottom Line for Investors

I strongly believe the current recession will be shorter, less painful, and will inflict far less damage on households and businesses than the Great Depression. But that’s not to say it will be an easy and painless downturn. All recessions hurt the economy and society at-large, and it will take time to rebuild.

In my view, however, getting the economy back to a strong position may require about 15-18 months, versus the 10+ years that were needed to recover from the Depression. There’s no comparison, in my view.",2020-05-16

That right there is where the issue is gonna be. Our country has been the worst about social distancing guidelines and regulations because of ""muh freedoms"" people. Our hospitalization, infection and death rates are going to be astronomical. Even if we don't go into an absolute quarantine, or close to what we were just in, the scope of businesses that will be allowed to be open or the number of people allowed in businesses will definitely be affected.

890,cerateCRT,fqtoaz4,/r/pennystocks/comments/gkvew5/gnus_any_chance_of_a_dip_below_1_before_june/fqtoaz4/,1,"I’m on the same boat with you too. I buy at 1.74 after a spike (Buy a lesson also) but I still optimistic because:

IMO, I absolutely believe they’ll advertise their new channel before they launch at June 15 to the public at the end of May or begin of June. Many daytrader and investors are going to jump in this boat. The price at that time can be $2++ (The resistance of $GNUS is around $1.85-$1.9).

In June 15, their channel called Kartoon Channel will launch in many platform like Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Comcast, Cox, SelectTV, DISH, Sling TV, Tubi, Xumo, etc... They estimated that they can reach 100mil TV users and 200mil over-the-air users (included mobile device). In this coronavirus situation, all of kids are staying at home. It leads to the amount of audience and attention from pulic are very large.

So if you don’t want to lose any profit from it, I encourage you to hold it until the day their channel launch or begin of June.

P/s: I consider to buy more if my RTTR run up after Qualigen acquires RTTR on Monday successful. Before GNUS run up, I bought at 0.95 and sold at 1.31.",2020-05-16

#1 - Jobs - The unemployment data is likely underreported and most of those jobs won't be coming back.  Once the PPP is up, the second wave will start.  Coincide that with demand drop and it just could stay elevated for a lot longer.  Jobs never come back as fast as they go.

2.  Event Driven - We were already on our way into a technical recession.  What the pandemic has shown is that we have a lot of leveraged up companies living paycheck to paycheck.  We have a housing market that the Fed is buying up mortgage backed securities at a high rate.   We have a repo market that had a liquidity problems before.  The economy is jacked.  Bankruptcies are starting and will continue.  Small businesses are going to close.  How we got here at this point is irrelevant.  Where we are now is the problem.  There are major problems that will either fix themselves through cleansing or the Fed will drop infinite money I to keeping them afloat.  So many bubbles are here.

3.  Government - Hahahaha.  We are literally doing all those things in various ways except cutting government spending for now.  Deflation is here with a potential of stagflation.  We have a nationalism trade war.  Consumer lending is tightened.  We just have the Fed printing away which will lead to higher taxes completing the circle of suck.

Bought high and bag-held even after the awful call. I should have done what OP suggested, noticed it was bad and either a) sold immediately or b) not sold at the EOD, because dead cats *always* bounce. I sold for a $600 loss - if I would have waited a couple days and waited for the dead bounce, I could have cut that to about $200. 

With GNUS, I sold my entire position the second the good news dropped during the CC, made about $150. 

I've made other, smaller wins since MVIS and am telling myself to be way smarter now. My goal is to recoup that entire loss, and so far I'm on the track to doing that, but it definitely requires some hard-learned lessons along the way. The thing is, if you ARE willing to learn from those lessons, and ACTUALLY change your actions/behavior, you'll start winning like I have recently.

I am building a database myself with the data that you are looking for and much more. To find historical market cap, you need of course shares outstanding data and historical daily price data.  To get historical daily price data - got to yahoo finance and you can find it with each ticker. To find shares outstanding - you need to dig SEC filings for each stock. Shares outstanding data is written in 10-q or 10-k filings, so you can go to historical filings and find out what was the number of shares outstanding some time ago. Then you have to multiply shares outstanding with the price on the day that you are analyzing the stock and you have your market cap. 

Float is even more tricky. To find historical stocks float - you need shares outstanding data and restricted stock data (insider ownership, institutional ownership). Insider and institutional ownership filings are difficult to analyze and it will take tons of time.

Anyways, if you want to do it by hand, it is almost impossible if you are looking for a significant dataset size. You can try some paid services but those are imo too expensive for personal use.

Consider this, there is no PR. The drug is already on the market, been fda approved for years, is currently being denied coverage by the largest insurance agencies meaning people will have to pay the sticker price of 1,100 for a month of consensi, and there are reports from doctors that this drug will not sell well for various reasons. 

What kind of PR do people think is going to happen? Even with their sales reps, those guys just call doctors and try pushing consensi onto their customers and bring awareness.  This does not translate to widespread PR.  This sub is waiting for like a consensi commercial or something, which might bump it but I dont see it happening. 

Not to mention good luck making money if you bought in after Sabby (who bought in at .4).  I just dont see where people think the hype is supposed to come from, MVIS was better hype than this by a huge margin.  Again, not trying to be a downer, hope everyone here makes $ but dont hold on waiting for all this PR randos keep promising, if you do you’ll probably be left holding the bag.

You being down 400 could be for numerous reasons and being down in money situationally at the moment is not a true indicator if your actually going to lose on your play.

Yes dont be attached to a stocks but dont be attached to money/capital as well.

You have to have a understanding of the data that is available and make a judgement from there. Money and Capital is inconsequential to this fact.

Last your conflating your shooting average with a proper judgement on a specific play.

&amp;#x200B;

You winning less but still making money is a different topic then you making the correct decision on a specific play. I only say that to say based on the data you provided you got lucky in both situations both making more while winning less and cutting stocks while a specific number down.

But there is no strategy there and no play to learn while participating in this manner.

KTOV, RTTR, and GNUS took a lot of investors attention this week. Meanwhile, FRSX was dipping due to only a quarter of average volume numbers throughout the week. FRSX will increase throughout next week, as volume starts ramping up like it did towards the end of the week. Soo, including PR's into this equation, I know it is capable of being over 2.50 by end of May, leading into June. And thats conservative. FRSX is more than that because it is a better company than MARK, which has thermal imaging for COVID-19 patients. What happens when Coronavirus has a cure/eventually subsides? Those thermal imaging set-ups are only going to be useful only for the common colds and fevers when that day comes, making its product more short-term focus, than FRSX has been working on innovative work that WILL carry forward once COVID-19 passes. To summarize this, FRSX will start to see 10-15% spikes throughout next week, and in the chance they release a PR then, it will be too late to get in on this one for the short term gains.

If you put 10k in them now you could come back to 10k, some more, or less in 5 years.

My guess is that people started selling on the news to beat the dip during AH, which triggered a bunch of stop losses, and it domino'd down. Hopefully dust will settle over the weekend and it'll recover.

I don't expect XSPA to be some wildly successful long term investment, but I do think they are being innovative in replacing their old business model that has no shot in a covid environment to filling a gap.",2020-05-16

So it's more like a 1 in 26 if you randomly bet on them and an increase of 150% would be $750 profit.

1458,AngelaTheRipper,fqvyzog,/r/pennystocks/comments/gkxubf/day_trading_stocks_for_beginners_gap_go_strategy/fqvyzog/,1,"I think I will make a PSA about Pattern Day Trader rule (PDT), which is what prevents most small traders from actually day trading seriously. 

Basically, unless you have $25k in your margin account or are using a cash account, you are restricted to a max of 3 day trades within any 5 trading day period. On the 6th trading day, the day trade will fall of your account. 

What's a day trade? Buying and selling the same stock within the same calendar day. Selling and then rebuying is not a day trade (if lets say you want to get some free shares from an incoming dip). However doing something like: You bought 50 stocks Friday, then 50 more Monday, and sold 50 Monday is a day trade. It's stupid but that's how it works. 

What's a margin and cash account? While margin generally means that you are borrowing money from your brokerage to buy stocks, a definition of margin account is that you can buy with unsettled funds, for instance you submitted a deposit but the brokerage offers you an instant deposit option, or you sold a stock and have the funds immediately available. A cash account makes you wait for the funds to settle (generally 2 days) before you can use the money to buy. Cash accounts are not subject to the PDT rule. 

What happens if you go over 3 day traders? You will get banned from day trading for 90 days. You can still buy and sell just fine.

So basically, if you have to burn a day trade for any reason (gotta lock in those profits or save your ass from a major loss) burn one, but be mindful of the limit, and if you're a small trader like a lot of us don't exactly plan on using day trading as your main source of income anytime soon. Final option is to downgrade to a cash account, but that does come with the 2 day waiting period before money from a sell is available for buying.",2020-05-16
