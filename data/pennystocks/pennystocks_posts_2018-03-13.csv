LAS VEGAS, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire -- Adama Technologies Corp. (OTCPINK:ADAC) announced today that they will bid on an additional $3,000,000 in new government contracts with at least $2,000,000 of that number being for US Military Defense contracts.  The Company detailed their month-of-March bidding plan and strategy and their optimism regarding their ability to win these contracts. 

Harold Tanner, President of Adama Technologies, stated, “Historically we have been very successful in winning these types of contracts simply because we have been building parts for military and defense contracts for a long, long time, over 50 years.  When we are bidding on these contracts, the people we are working with already know us and in many cases have awarded bids to us previously and have seen our work and our ability to perform.  Additionally, we have a great structure and system in place that allows us to keep our costs manageable and therefore our pricing on these contracts is always very competitive.”

The Company also pointed to several cost-cutting strategies that enable their price points to be what they believe are among the best in the country.  Mr. Tanner continued, “We have employed numerous strategies to ensure our prices are always among the best.  By having our own in-house engineering team, we have eliminated a very expensive line item that is often outsourced to a third-party firm.  We also have a very committed labor force who has tremendous experience with these parts so our efficiency and speed are truly remarkable.  Truthfully, there is no substitute for the fact we have been doing this for more than 50 years. Having recently become part of a publicly traded company I am thankful for the opportunity to tell our story to a broader audience.”

The Company reiterated a commitment to growth and continuing to be aggressive in pursuing new sales channels and additional defense contracts.  Mr. Tanner concluded, “We have reached the point within our management, growth, infrastructure and strategic planning where we feel very confident in our ability to scale the business and really be aggressive in bringing in additional contracts and new revenue.  Our team is doing an incredible job of streamlining operations, bringing on reliable subcontractors and phasing in additional third-party operators to allow us to grow at a much faster rate.”

The Company stated that they intend to keep the market readily updated via continued press updates as well as through the Company’s social media channels.  As the bidding process is underway, the Company will continue to seek additional revenue opportunities in their commercial and retail outlets as well and plan to provide a more robust media update regarding their commercial sales division in the upcoming weeks.
