2,What is driving SHMP so fast and crazy???,anle0b,1Dru,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/anle0b/what_is_driving_shmp_so_fast_and_crazy/,1,42,"So I had bought in back in October for 30k shares @ $.006 a pop. Sold some time early January for $.03 and then bought another 20k for $.04 and sold @ $.085. Which, in hindsight, I want to kick myself in the ass...for obvious reasons. I’ve held this company because I did a good amount of DD on it and found it to be a solid company and I still do. Well, I bit the bullet and bought another 4K shares @$.18 and sold at .27. Now I can’t figure out if I should buy in again around $.25 or what. Because I just don’t know when this massive run will stop. Honestly, I’ve been busy and haven’t been able to find out what is pushing it so much. 

My question is, what do you think this stock will do over the next couple months? Also, how far do you think this thing will dip back down?? I’m kinda sketchy to buy in at $.25 but would hate to keep seeing it run and run and run like it’s been doing. I mean, it’s been steadily climbing every since I originally bought in back in October. Albeit it moved much slower the previous few months. But once this thing surpassed  $.05, it just took off very quickly.

8,"Why 4 Industry Analysts See This Company as Undervalued Based on Its Water Rights Alone [QTRRF, QTA]",ans7rd,rtomassini,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ans7rd/why_4_industry_analysts_see_this_company_as/,1,0,"Quaterra Resources Inc. (QTA:TSX.V; QTRRF:OTCQX), a small-cap company with a portfolio of assets in the historical copper mining area of Yerington, Nevada, owns water rights, valuable assets in the deserts of Nevada. And it has begun to monetize them.

""Controlling the water rights gives Quaterra a massive advantage in a very mining-friendly state where water resources are scarce."" - Keith Kohl, Pure Energy Trader
In September 2018, Quaterra entered into a purchase agreement to sell certain primary ground rights to Desert Pearl Farms LLC for $6.2 million. The State of Nevada Division of Water Resources needs to approve the change of the water rights from mining to agriculture, a process that is currently underway, and the company expects the deal to close shortly.

After the deal closes, Quaterra reported it will still have about 6,700 acre-feet per year of primary ground water permitted for mining on its 52 square mile Yerington property.

""These water rights are key to district development,"" explained Quaterra Chairman and CEO Tom Patton. ""These are already permitted for mining and milling, and have seniority it terms of priority of usage. Based on the recent purchase and sale agreement, Quaterra's 6,700 acre-feet of primary ground water is valued at about US$20 million.""

""The value of the company's water rights greatly exceeds its market valuation."" - Clive Maund, CliveMaund.com
The company noted that the 2012 PEA at MacArthur estimated water usage of 2,590 acre-feet per year for a 41,000 ton per day oxide project, and it estimates that a 50,000 ton per day sulfide mill will consume about 3,100 acre-feet annually. Quaterra additionally has substantial water rights associated with parcels of private land it has under option.

Analyst Sid Rajeev with Fundamental Research Corp., in a September, 2018, report, placed a fair value estimate on Quaterra shares of CA$0.49 per share. With 257 million shares fully diluted, that valuation implies a market cap of about CA$126 million, or around US$96 million.

Shares are currently trading at around CA$0.095, resulting in a market cap of approximately CA$24 million, or US$18 million, substantially below the estimated value of the water rights of US$26 million.

Rajeev commented that Quaterra's announcement that it had entered an agreement to sell some water rights is a ""very positive development as it is a non-dilutive way to fund advancement of the MacArthur copper project.""

Keith Kohl wrote in Pure Energy Trader on January 25, that controlling the ""water rights gives Quaterra a massive advantage in a very mining-friendly state where water resources are scarce. Without the proper water rights, development of the Yerington District would grind to a standstill.""

However, ""Quaterra doesn't need to sell these water rights right away, and can use them to their full advantage whenever it suits them. In the event that we start to see more consolidation in the Yerington District, these groundwater rights will be immensely valuable to Quaterra and its shareholders,"" Kohl stated.

Bob Moriarty of 321 Gold noted on January 28, ""At today's price, the market only values Quaterra at $8.76 million USD yet sometime between now and the end of March they will be closing on the water sale and will bring in $6 million USD. For all practical purposes, valuation of the water rights sets a floor under the price of the shares. Selling the surplus water rights gives an implied value of about $20 million USD for the remaining 6,700 acre-feet of water.""

Technical analyst Clive Maund wrote on CliveMaund.com on January 28, Quaterra Resources ""is in possession of valuable water rights that are much in demand, and in fact the value of the company's water rights greatly exceeds its market valuation, which should mean that either the stock price will improve or it will get bought up. . .Quaterra has already sold some of its water rights and will be in receipt of the proceeds soon, which means that it is solvent and can, if it wishes, proceed to advance its projects.""

Quaterra is exploring its property as demand for copper is projected to skyrocket, due to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, such as Teslas, along with the development of renewable sources of energy. Electric vehicles can use more than three times the amount of copper than gasoline-powered vehicles.

U.S. copper projects, in particular, are coming into the limelight, as manufacturers look for steady sources of metal. According to Reuters, pro-mining policies in the U.S. and increasing nationalistic sentiment in other countries are driving this trend, and more than $1.1 billion has been invested in U.S. copper projects.

The International Copper Study Group and DBS estimate U.S. copper production to increase by at least 8% over the next four years, Reuters reported, and four companies, including Nevada Copper Corp. plan to open copper mines by the end of next year.

""The copper industry needs areas of good supply with low political risk, and that's what we get in the United States,"" Stephen Gill of Pala Investments, which is Nevada Copper Corp.'s (NCU:TSX) largest shareholder, told Reuters. Located in Yerington, Nevada, Nevada Copper's Pumpkin Hollow project is less than 60 km from Tesla's Gigafactory.

The Yerington area, where Quaterra hosts several properties, is re-emerging as a copper district; it is the site of the old Anaconda mine. The area has more than 17 billion pounds of copper in the Measured and Indicated categories, and is 70 miles southeast of Reno.

Quaterra's properties adjoin both Nevada Copper's land and Mason Resources' copper projects that HudBay Minerals Inc. (HBM:TSX; HBM:NYSE) just acquired.

Quaterra map

""Quaterra's assets at Yerington have multiple development and redevelopment opportunities, significant exploration upside and are a logical starting point for District consolidation,"" Patton told Streetwise Reports. ""They consist of the MacArthur oxide and sulfide deposit; the Yerington pit sulfide and oxide deposit previously mined by Anaconda; the Bear porphyry copper deposit; and several untested exploration targets.""

The company is preparing a prefeasibility study for MacArthur, located in the north of Quaterra's land position. A 2012 preliminary economic assessment (PEA) estimated the production of approximately 748 million pounds of copper over 18 years at an average operating cost of $1.89 per pound. According to the company, ""based on the three-year average copper price at the time ($3.48 per pound) the PEA estimated a pre-tax internal rate of return of 29.3%, a payback of 2.7 years and a pre-tax net present value of $284.1 million at an 8% discount rate."" Copper is currently trading at around $2.70 per pound.

Quaterra's properties have not escaped notice. Bob Moriarty of 321 Gold wrote on January 28, ""Quaterra is in progress with a Pre-Feasibility Study with the intention of lowering capital costs with the elimination of a $65 million acid plant, using a more timely base cost of $3 a pound for copper and using higher copper grades. They expect to complete the PFS within eighteen months with an updated resource model and an optimized mine plan.""

""The Yerington Copper District is ripe for consolidation. Nearby Nevada Copper is going into production at their Pumpkin Hollow deposit at the end of 2019. Hudbay Minerals only recently announced completion of a purchase of Mason Resources and their Ann Mason copper property in Yerington for about $31 million CAD. Other companies than Quaterra put value in the Yerington Copper District,"" Moriarty concluded.

Keith Kohl wrote in Pure Energy Trader on January 25, ""MacArthur truly is a huge low-cost, conventional project with near-term production potential. . . Right now, the company is currently working to solidify the PEA for MacArthur, and the goal is to move forward with the preparation of a Pre-Feasibility Study. . . As one of the best conductors out there, roughly 60% of total copper use is for electricity and heat. Copper plays a critical role for renewables, too, from photo-voltaic solar cells to wind turbines.""

Fundamental Research Corp analyst Sid Rajeev, in a September 2018, report, commented, ""A prefeasibility study (PFS) on the MacArthur deposit was initiated in January 2018. We expect significant improvements in the PFS from lower CAPEX and higher grades and recovery rates.""

NEW YORK, Feb. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OTCinsider.com News Commentary –  


Cannabidiol (CBD) products have had the biggest buzz in 2019. CBD-infused beverages offer the greatest potential to tap into this trend, with products that offer an entry point to the exploding cannabis market, which appeal to people just learning the benefits of CBD and those who have been diehard users for many years.

Even with the growing demand for cannabis products, Canaccord’s Bobby Burleson and Jonathan DeCourcey project that infused CBD beverages could outpace general demand for marijuana products by two-fold, taking 20% of the existing market for cannabis edibles by 2022. Recent reports indicate that the CBD market is estimated to grow 700% by 2020. Hemp Business Journal, a market intelligence research firm, projects that the CBD market will grow to $2.1 billion by 2020, an astronomical jump from 2017, when the market only had a value of $202 million.

CBD infused beverages has the most growth potential amongst the athletic inclined demographic, as this segment is traditionally one that has dispensable income to spend on CBD products. A majority of this segment is still learning about the benefits of CBD and will take some time to fully incorporate CBD into their existing regimen. There are a few companies that have positioned themselves to become mainstream beverages in the CBD-infused beverage space and based on their recent marketing efforts around the Super Bowl, are poised to gain exposure and credibility for their efforts, which will separate them from their competitors. 

Baristas Coffee Company, Inc. (OTC:BCCI), a CBD infused coffee brand,  had two digital ads that were transmitted onsite during the Super Bowl which featured its bestselling White Coffee (www.trywhitecoffee.com) and its EnrichaRoast CBD Coffee ([www.baristas.tv](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vPs-dC3S5CJVBA8gIdxvwgtrhGQqwqESzlcpmBTs9Oi1lVSwEj0laX9sSqV53S3Q_K2Y0PPgp-__2sF2q06cxw==)), a blend which uses a proprietary technology that infuses the CBD to the beans after they have been roasted. BCCI also had engagement with their advertising program during the halftime show featuring Maroon 5 and will be utilized again during the Grammy awards this weekend featuring recording artist Megs Mclean. These advertising programs during such mainstream events like the Super Bowl and Grammy’s is indoctrinating CBD and CBD-infused beverages into the national conscious, giving it credibility to be accepted as a regular beverage akin to chai tea or flavored coffee.

American Premium Water Corporation (OTC:HIPH), the parent company of LALPINA CBD also had a very visible presence at this year’s Super Bowl, sponsoring the R.Moss by Antar Levar launch party. The event, which was a launch for a tailored menswear collection designed by NFL Hall of Famer Randy Moss, was at the Willis &amp; Walker store, the big and tall brand of NBA All-Star Kevin Willis. HIPH, which began selling its LALPINA CBD product last August, has expanded its distribution to a wide variety of retailers including:

* Fit Food Fresh ([https://www.fitfoodfresh.com](http://pr.report/HC5GeutJ)) in southern Florida along with its fresh prepared food plans
* Come Back Daily ([www.comebackdaily.co](http://pr.report/3Rz8JVtC)) in New York, NY. 
* Sobe Finest Car wash in Miami Beach, FL ([www.sobefinest.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d4Xejx7FPJGQ5oJWOlIJH_JY3hfdpXE92D2ag0v2zn7jQX66xRNb8gRrYgZ-jXlm0jwk5tI6nwVZ8pJGeLyLjPIGSC4Ti8TGizKsP6trfUs=)).
* SingleSeed Online Shop [https://www.singleseed.com](https://www.singleseed.com/)

HIPH has done a good job getting mainstream publicity with its marketing efforts premium branding, which has leveraged the brand’s past as one of the first domestic pH alkaline brands to enter the marketplace in 2013. The Company has also been working with Jack Brewer, CEO of the Brewer Group to get integrating into more sports and entertainment marketing, as they were one of the presenting sponsors of a Snoop Dog performance earlier this year. Mr. Brewer, a 6-year National Football League veteran and CBD proponent, is a brand ambassador for the Company, and has the network of retired athletes that will assist HIPH in educating the public about the benefits of CBD, which has the potential to be an all-natural replacement for opioids, benefiting retired players, whose struggle with opioid addiction has been well documented.

There are other companies in the marketplace attempting to market CBD products, but OTCMarketInsider does not feel that these companies have positioned their brands for long term success. Profile Solutions, Inc. (OTC:PSIQ), which is the licensee of Cheech &amp; Chong brand for CBD infused products, is leveraging too heavily on this particular license, which could affect its ability to gain mainstream traction. There is already a misconception in the marketplace that CBD is infused with THC and combined with the association with Cheech and Chong, a brand that has been associated with marijuana for over forty years, it could inhibit PSIQ ability to achieve long-term revenue growth. Sipp Industries, (OTC:SIPC) is another CBD infused beverage company that so far has not achieved the revenue growth of its peers, which OTCMarketsInsider believes is partly due to the fact it has not created a compelling marketing program to distinguish itself as a mainstream brand. Its branding utilizing traditional cannabis leaf branding that traditional “pot” brands have adapted over the years, could continue to inhibit SIPC from gaining mainstream prevalence.",2019-02-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/antvet/sipc_bcci_breaking_news_these_cbd_companies_are/

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Feb. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eighties icon Kelly LeBrock (Weird Science) stars in an upcoming mystery series from Big Screen Entertainment Group (OTC:BSEG).  


“Tales From a Hidden Chamber” will be an eight part thriller for social media platforms with each episode between 5 and 15 minutes long to fit the format of Facebook video, YouTube and IGTV, Instagram’s new video platform.

The series, about what lurks behind a two-way mirror, also stars Erin Cahill (How I Met Your Mother) and aims to expand film company BSEG’s web presence and impact.

“Our goal is to make Big Screen a well-known and much-loved brand over social media,” says Sandro Monetti, BSEG’s Head of Content Development.

Creating such content for the web - which increases visibility, awareness and sales of the company’s films – is a key part of that process.

“Tales From a Hidden Chamber” is directed by Big Screen’s Stephen Eckelberry, an expert in the multi-platform space with over 1 million views on Facebook of a recently produced video.
