It's had nothing but a steady downward trend with a small pop lately but not enough to make me interested. They aren't profitable and their year on year earnings growth rate is negative. They have a lot more debt compared to income. The company has been around since 02 but everyone on their board and management teams have been with the company less than a year which tells me lots of shakeups and no results. Basically I think in my personal opinion is looks like shit. I wouldn't gamble on it unless there was a good press release and then it would be a day trade.,2018-05-19

As a day trader, do you think I should be looking for breakouts in support or resistance? I don't exactly have the funds to make the daily amount I want to make thru selling on pullbacks.
