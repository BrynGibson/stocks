But I’ve heard that thinkorswim is a pretty good platform although I’m not sure how much commissions are. I don’t day trade but I use tradingview for my analytics and Robinhood as a broker so you could consider doing something like that.",2019-09-29

Commissions will kill you - unless you call them and tell them that you want to move over from another platform (tastyworks) but want to negotiate commissions down. They’ll give you a deal if you tell them you’re moving like 25k or more over, so do that. You don’t actually HAVE to put that much in, they’re not gonna check at all.
 Oh and if they ask you how much you trade don’t tell them you’re new, the deal will be off. If you’re talking forex, tell them you trade about ~5 lots a day on average. If it’s stocks, i would say about 10% with tight stop loss. Options say about 3 contracts a day.",2019-09-29
2,TheEarningsTrader,f1vb0cu,/r/pennystocks/comments/davs7t/some_beginner_help/f1vb0cu/,3,"Use a few demo/paper trading accounts first, I have used interactive broker in the past but the software isn't that easy to get along with as it is rather professional. Same with CityIndex but I prefer cityindex because it is much easier once you figure out everything. 

Most brokers use the same prices for the demo as they do for their real accounts so you can see how much they charge in commissions etc and make sure you look for hidden costs. I was caught out once with a UK stock because the broker charged for both opening and closing the stock which was very expensive on a small account. Are you looking to trade both Forex and Penny stocks from the same broker? Because I trade both Forex and stocks so I use a CFD account because it is easier for me because of the country that I am in.",2019-09-29

If you've been around for a bit, I'd recommend getting level 2 services. Those data packages will bring you to a new level. Trading on Robinhood is great for being commission free, but it minimizes your market exposure. If you are trading under $1000 pertrade, Robinhood is your only friend. If you're over $1000 per trade, go to interactive brokers. That way you only need a 1-2% gain to break even.

If in Canada, use Questrade. I've used RBC active trading for cheap data, 30 trades in 3 months will get you free level 2 access.",2019-09-29

9,calvin50,f1wx2d9,/r/pennystocks/comments/davs7t/some_beginner_help/f1wx2d9/,1,You’re not ready: there are several good brokers. A lot of traders use TDameritrade for the think or swim platform. E*TRADE has E*TRADE pro also good. Both are payed trades. There are others that depending on your finances will be cheaper and better. For now you should paper trade on each broker to find one that suits you. I like webull for free commissions trading . I Day trader from my phone and they are fast . I also like there paper trade account. This is what you’re ready for a paper trade account. That way you will know you like the broker before you put money in,2019-09-29
