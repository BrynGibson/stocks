0,Are penny stocks slowing down? $BOXL $SEEL $CIFS $JMU,b7otfl,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/b7otfl/are_penny_stocks_slowing_down_boxl_seel_cifs_jmu/,9,15,"Are micro and nano-cap stocks started to slow down?

&amp;#x200B;

We see less and less great opportunities that we saw these past two months. No real great nano cap runners to trade only bouncing stocks, gap sell-offs and slow down trending price action is observed.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this is very natural and opportunities come and go. This might be the time that opportunities just dried up. So we should be looking for a new wave of nano cap runners in the future. But for now, it seems the penny stock niche is slower. Do you agree?

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, some penny stocks still move so let's look at some of the most interesting stock from this week.

&amp;#x200B;

$BOXL the past spiker gapped up but was sold down at the end of the day. The problem with this stock was that there was no real volume and no news associated with the stock move. As well stock traded in a very tight range. 4 dollars price level acted as a resistance level for this stock and last day close as support. But between this to points there was not really much room for price to move. I do think the stock will slowly fade away.

&amp;#x200B;

$SEEL is a very hot stock that has big interest from the public (my observation from looking at Google trends and Stocktwits). The stock gapped up and was sold down. On Thursday during after market hours the company released an update on pipeline developments and corporate highlights. So the real play was done during Thursday's aftermarket and Friday's pre-market sessions. So when the stock opened on Friday sell-off was intact. Hard to tell if the stock will fade so quietly as most of the penny stocks do. Looking at price action it seems that stock can squeeze and price can increase. But we will see if this true in the upcoming week.

&amp;#x200B;

$CIFS $JMU were stocks that you should not chase. I know some off you might be looking to buy these stock because of Thursday's price action. But be aware that the main price increases for these stocks already happened and this type of the price action we saw is called dead cat bounce and should not be mistaken with the genuine price increase. Stocks can be squeezed and some price increase possible but most likely not a drastic jump and long term prices for these stocks should fade away to lower lows.
