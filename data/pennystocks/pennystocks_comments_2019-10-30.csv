Seems like the FDA has been helping them along and really wants this one to work since it's the only drug in its class with this delivery mechanism, good confidence it'll be approved because the FDA could've pulled the plug much earlier if they had legitimate concerns. Just need to make sure they have cash but reported they're good until at least 2nd half of next year.

Price target is around $2 but it was within mid $3s before denial and some sites have it after approval at $8. Even on the rumor alone a few months back it popped from $0.50 to $1.3 in a day; been bleeding a little bit since but this week has seen buying volume uptick and much less short interest, setting up for something real special.",2019-10-30

Your stock is going back and forth between $.000001 and $.0001.

That basically means that’s retail traders are putting up their shares for sale on the Ask at $.0001 (because they can’t ask any lower). 

The trades getting executed at .000001 occur when retail traders do a market sell order. But since no retail traders can Bid below .0001, those lucky guys catching those .000001 dumps are the market makers. 

Then the market makers are probably getting first dibs at selling at .0001, forcing retail to dump at .000001. Must be nice for the market makers.",2019-10-30
