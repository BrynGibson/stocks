COSTA MESA, Calif., Jan. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- Sipp Industries, Inc. (OTC: SIPC), a multifaceted corporation specializing in technology, manufacturing and distribution of commercial and consumer products, announces the second run of Major Hemp H-IPA has been completed and will be packaged this month for immediate distribution.   


In less than three months since its launch, Major Hemp H-IPA has been placed in over 75 establishments throughout Illinois.  With brisk sales momentum and month over month growth, the company is in the midst of hiring a dedicated Sales Executive/Account Manager to conduct new prospect marketing and hemp brew tastings while attending craft beer events around the state.  This individual will also manage and expand business with major accounts such as Binny’s Beverage Depot and Armanetti’s, along with new major grocery and convenience store chains that are coming online.

Based on feedback from customers, the company has released a new, eye-catching, Major Hemp H-IPA label design which can be found on the company’s website and social media.  Current buyers are excited about the new label design and Major Hemp’s distributors believe it will further enhance sales within the existing customer base, as well as attract new accounts and patrons.

President Ted Jorgensen of wholly-owned subsidiary, Major Hemp, commented, “We are very excited to have achieved this landmark milestone of attaining over 75 locations in less than 100 days after our launch of Major Hemp H-IPA.  Sales have vastly exceeded initial projections and that’s a testament to our combined sales efforts with Wein-Bauer in tandem with the quality of brewing by Church Street.  Due to our accelerating growth, by the end of this month we expect to hire a new team member to assist us in the further development and saturation of the Illinois market.  Furthermore, we are excited about the recent enactment of federal hemp legalization and the Federal Drug Administration’s (FDA) decision to certify the active hemp ingredient in our beers, hemp seed protein, as a consumable ingredient in the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) category.  We believe this will provide a definitive answer for the breweries and distributors that had remained on the sidelines awaiting further clarity on the legality of hemp seed beers, opening up additional business opportunities with well-established partners moving forward this year.”

Sipp Industries is prepared to submit multiple additional recipes and label designs to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) immediately after the conclusion of the government shutdown, including a recipe on the very cutting-edge of America’s palate in 2019.",2019-01-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/agni2f/sipc_sipp_industries_completes_second_brewing_run/

11,Why investing in cheap Canadian Health services is a risk with a big reward.,aglpyw,Krisforfun,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/aglpyw/why_investing_in_cheap_canadian_health_services/,1,0,"1) medical cannabis is making its way to pharmacies, which means it's likely to make its way to the doctor's office as well. From the professionals I've spoken to, none of them are comfortable enough to advise their patients on how to use the medication. That can mean companies like PHGI are needed.


2) it appears everyone in the country hates the liberal government in power because all they do is lie. You're very likely to see either a far-left social government in power (which means way more money spent in the healthcare industry) or a conservative government in power, you love the idea of a two-tier healthcare system. 

3) the baby boomers in Canada are getting older, and they will be the next ones to enter the nursing homes in the next 2 to 3 years. Young Canadians are lazy for the most part, and don't take care of the seniors simply because they don't know how to. they will be way more reliant on the healthcare system to take charge. 

4) there are serious problems with the doctors unions in Canada right now, and there's a whole lot of fighting / breaking up amongst themselves. When this happens, you either get the creation of a new Union, or they dissolve completely. Regardless of what happens, they will start looking for alternate business partners to align themselves with when it comes to computer systems, information and databases. 


This is just a little food for thought. As I said before I pay attention to how these organizations operate, and when there's power struggles people tend to split up, and spend their money on something new. 

Healthspace data systems, PHGI, and medical cannabis companies may be a good look.

I'm not a professional, but I've had my own dealings with the healthcare system in the last year and it's an absolute shit show. No one is happy with it from the people I talk to,  including the doctors.
