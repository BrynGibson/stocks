Looking at the chart, I would not expect to see this stock pop, especially to $55. The stock has been not above 1.2 for over 80 days. Go back further, you can see that this stock has been headed down since February '19. 

I can see no reason this stock would break that 80 day streak (1.2). 

Still, 1.2 from current levels is a 80% gain, but you have to get past that 1.10 resistance trend. 

What are your reasons for looking at this stock. I am especially interested in the fact that you think this stock is going to break $50.00. This would represent a 34,000% increase from where it is now. The stock has never been worth that much, when you take into account the splits, etc.",2020-03-04
