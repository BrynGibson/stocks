The financial outlook is questionable. They had hardly no cash on hand, and had reasonable amounts of debt. The company is also pending cashing in on convertible notes for the payment schedule from Optima Fixed Income once they reached their milestone. Which will keep them solvent, but dilute shareholder value. May have potential for scalping gains on a spike up, as it has a history of doing it, but I would only day trade it and not risk holding on such a day, and assuming it has much higher than usual volume. 

But they are nearly insolvent. Excerpt from their 10Q;

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $179 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $5,237 in negative working capital, a stockholders‚Äô deficiency of approximately $5,265 and an accumulated deficit of approximately $18,390. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern. Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions and revenue from operations. Management anticipates their business will require substantial additional investments that have not yet been secured. Management is continuing in the process of fund raising in the private equity and capital markets as the Company will need to finance future activities. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.‚Äù

For the record, I‚Äôm not a licensed broker nor is this investment advice. Just purely educational based off the education I have and my experience.


When I see a jump in price like this and miss entry after hours, I remain patient and wait until premarket shows support and direction. I usually enter with a small percent, usually 10-25% of my buying power on a pullback assuming that doesn‚Äôt break the bull run (which is what it looks to besetting up to do,)

If it does break out another level to the next resistance, I wait for a pullback and buy another partial, make sure it holds support, and then do the same on the pullback thereafter. Granted this is just how I take an entry, but I take profits similarly as I go. I‚Äôll sell into the next spike up, buying more on the pullback.

Anyways, not trying to give unwanted advice, but provide insight that‚Äôs spared me in situations like you described.

You may miss out on some gains, but if there‚Äôs a sell off at open,  you cut losses quick and small, and then wait to see where the next support is and if it holds.

Best of luck",2019-06-27

Just be sure to cancel it so it doesn‚Äôt renew right after you purchase if you don‚Äôt want it to renew at cost.

The book; ‚ÄúThe Market Whisperer‚Äù by Meir Barak.

He is an excellent educational resource, however I personally don‚Äôt advocate for his training program unless you‚Äôre just taking advantage of the free challenge competition / live trading room. The trading room is the best part of their online education, and I would advise reading his book while being a part of the live trading room.

Even if you don‚Äôt trade alongside them, just watch and learn how they plan, enter, and exit trades. There is a lot to be aware of, but profitability is attainable in 6-12 months if you work your ass off. Just remember it takes time, persistence, and discipline. Don‚Äôt get discouraged, and if you are using an amount of money that when you lose, it discourages you... you should downsize your positions to what you‚Äôre willing to lose and be ok with. Sounds like an oxymoron, but one of the biggest elements to trading profitably with consistency is overcoming the psychological disadvantages the money can influence in our trading styles.

Anywho, hope you get around to reading the book and check out his training program. I would not advise paying to sign up for his program, but simply do the free trading room / challenge they have, as the challenge inherently includes the trading room access for a week. It was the biggest help in starting out my trading career. Could even convince family or friends to sign up after your trial expires so they can share their access and give you prolonged access.",2019-06-27

But if you were watching Bitcoin the last week you saw it did indeed tumble down to 9,600 at its lowest. I honestly thought it would drop as low as 7k so I didn't buy at 9,600 (if I did, I would be sitting on some big gains :/ and covered my losses from the Coinbase crash)

The main reason I had for this is many people bought into the hype and raised the price to an unsustainable level (often happens in stock trading, where the price is far above fair value), so the price would correct itself to a more reasonable level.

Contributing to the tumble would be the fact that many people bought high, so everyone would be selling en masse to cover their losses, and those people that bought low, would be selling once they realized the price was not going to peak again anytime soon.

The whole Libra thing - I've found a lot of people torn about. Some believe it did push Bitcoins price up during the rally, others thing its just a coincidence, I'm on the coincidence side of the argument, but don't have too strong of an opinion.
