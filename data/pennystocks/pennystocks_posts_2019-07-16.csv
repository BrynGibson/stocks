15,$TRNX ($MNGA) - wut is you doin bby?,ce0quu,block_bleeder,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ce0quu/trnx_mnga_wut_is_you_doin_bby/,11,16,"I won't get into this company. Okay fuck it, a little bit. I got my nut from $0.67-$0.95 in a big way, but I've been following Taronis for fucking years. 

Flash forward to today... $TRNX trying to break $0.50 amongst hysteria, and offering equal credit in 8/15 parent spinoff. 


I don't know where to start....  I don't make threads ever, and I'm never on here. But I'm overly familiar with this. Here's my 0.02 if you want it:

I've been a commercial contractor for 13 years. I work nowhere near this stuff, but I have close friends in the welding industry, and contacts who have been exposed to this stuff. Since 06'-ish, I've been infatuated with the oil, gas, PM, ect. markets. I don't offer my opinion often, but this is 1 of the 2 stocks I have traded in the past 4 years. (futures and options exclusively for me) 

$TRNX is fucking garbage.

I use such harsh words, because they have really fucked over investors (myself not included). This company is all over the place, and knows how to burn money. TRNX is a collab of subs engaging from water filtration, waste repro, welding from a retail standpoint - which hinges on their baby...

**MagneGas**

Patented by Ruggero Santilli (mad fringe scientist), 69.5% hydrogen, 28% carbon monoxide, 1.4% methane, .67% nitrogen, 0.22% oxygen, and some other junk. It's not revolutionary, and it's not taking the industry by storm. In short, there's nothing miraculous about this. Call it what it is, it is a syngas.

It works though. It does compete (and beat) acetylene almost across the board, but it comes with uncertainty. Behind one genius mind, are a lot of coat riders. This board has been filled with dolts from the jumpstart. No vision, no market, a complete circus. This jumped almost 100% last year when certain family members resigned their positions... (just one small event among the chaos)

Outside of juiced in family, it's still the same board. Same stagnated people. This entire operation has had a ""learn as you go"" mentality from the start. Lawsuits, deaths, their reputation is terrible.

People are excited over smoke, and mirrors here. Taronis is a legitimate syngas marketed as a magic potion. It doesn't separate itself away from the competition or alternative enough to justify the risk and uncertainty.... yet???

This can only be built on structure, and reputation. As long as guys like Ermanno Santilli, and Robert L. Dingess are sitting on the top of this thing, it goes nowhere. If/when a top governor of propane switches sides to head this thing, Taronis would go bonkers. If they can keep up a concrete reputation for 4-5 years, it's inevitable. Are they capable? With this bunch? Shit, maybe!

1 $TRNX = 1 $TFUEL on 8/15/19

$TRNX is essentially worthless, and is acting in place of what public interest gauges TFUEL will be sans a couple cents. Pumped to exhaustion, and blows up before the deadline. The smart money who is holding long here dumps before the split, and re-buys OTC. 

All of you who are long and baghold, should obviously average down OTC. It definitely should pay off, and possibly in a big way. This will never be widely accepted though in the near future. This company has plenty of forced installation through their accusations, and have done their job internally promoting this from the ground up on impressionable new minds. 


TL;DR: this cult-like company has a syngas that is an alt to acetylene. they believe it cures cancer, but it actually is an efficient alt to acetylene. 

-- Anyone buying this to hold $trnx will lose.
-- Anyone buying this to hold into the split at $0.40 - $0.50 + will lose (almost guaranteed)


All my honest opinion of course. I hope Taronis Fuels flourishes. It won't happen until an overhaul is made, and a reputable name in the industry puts his name behind this.",2019-07-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ce0quu/trnx_mnga_wut_is_you_doin_bby/

*Company adds established branded passenger excursion line to growing portfolio of shortline railroads*

LAS VEGAS, July 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- United Rail, Inc. (OTCPK: URAL), a short-line railroad consolidator and owner of the SmartRail brand for Precision Railroading, today announced that it has acquired the assets of CA-based Key Holidays and Key Tours International.

Key Holidays is well-known in the U.S. travel industry and is designated as a full ticketing and Regional Tour Operator for Amtrak, as well as all major cruise lines such as Princess Cruises, Cunard Line and others.  Key Holidays offers a variety of quality travel tours with its vast experience and venue relationships. 

Michael Barron, CEO of United Rail, said, “I am pleased to announce that we have acquired Key Holidays.  They have been in business for 36 years and have established a strong recognized brand in the travel business.  The Key brand will remain as our primary tour operator going forward and selling our products under the Key brand.”

Mr. Barron continued, “Key is well-known for its Reno Fun Train and Sierra Scenic Train.  The 500 passenger, 15 car Reno Fun Train is an over 21 party train and will be re-branded as The Reno Xpress, a sister company to the coming Las Vegas Xpress, coming in 2020.” Mr. Barron added, “The Sierra Scenic Train will also be re-branded as the Reno Xpress.  The Donner Pass route is the most historic and scenic rail line in America.  Add the snowy beauty of winter and it is spectacular.  We have onboard entertainment, live music and lots of fun for all.”

“Our plan is to relocate the Key Holidays office to a new centralized facility for all of our passenger train and excursion bookings including The Reno Xpress, Las Vegas Xpress, X Wine Railroad, Polar Bear and our additional planned acquisitions,” said Barron.

Key Holidays offers regional Amtrak tours primarily in the western U.S.: Yosemite, Sequoia, Santa Barbara, Hearst Castle, Monterey, San Francisco, Reno, Portland and Pacific Northwest.  Key Holiday packages usually include Amtrak ticketing, hotel accommodations, transfers and sightseeing.  Some tours include meal or discounted meals. Key charter trains are a combo of Amtrak cars and private rail cars with optional hotel package.
