It touched 2.00, then crashed down to 1.00 at the end of the day, so I was already suspicious of it.  They were in a tremendous amount of debt.  It opened at .87, but 6.00am, all of a sudden a bunch of offers at 1.50, 1.70, then 2.25 started getting taken for small orders.  Clear pump and dump.  This all happened in a few minutes
