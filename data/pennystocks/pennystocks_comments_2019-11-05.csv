Summary

Discovery Gold Corp (DCGD) is a $150M+ empty shell – an unheard of valuation for a shell with no cash, no assets, and no business.
Investors appear to believe the company’s new CEO, Justin Costello, is an exceptional businessman in the cannabis sector, but our research reveals that is not the case.
Our research suggests that Costello didn’t graduate from Harvard Business School, despite it saying that in DCGD’s SEC filing and promotional websites.
Our research shows that Costello’s company, GRN Funds, is not a registered hedge fund despite the company saying that it is.
We have tipped off the SEC to these falsehoods and submitted this report to the agency.
At the moment, Discovery Gold Corp (OTCPK:DCGD), is an empty shell stock with a $150M+ market cap. This is an unheard of valuation for a shell. Right now, investors literally own nothing except the stock symbol listed on the OTC exchange. It has no cash, no assets, and no business. Shells generally have an intrinsic value of about $500K, which is on average what they sell for on this website.

We believe once all the hype settles down and DCGD finishes its reverse merger, investors will experience a 95-98% decline in share price to about $0.02 or less.",2019-11-05

I have been trading stocks since I was 18, with the rise of zero commissions I am full force back in the game. here is the way I do it

I have a daily scanner that shows stocks with unusual (high) volume, a high market cap, and a specified price range (under $10)

&amp;#x200B;

from there I start looking for indicators: Research these and how they work.

my first look is a MACD that has a large gap followed by a  positive crossover below 0

a stochastic indicator that is spiking above 30%

a high ATR

and an RSI showing overbought that is indicating that the MACD gap is in fact true

&amp;#x200B;

(this can be used for swing trading or day trading, always check the 4 main charts. YTD for support/resistance. the 30-minute chart for indicators (this is the main I use) the 15 minute to confirm daily trends and the 1 minute for the strongest(cheapest) entry point possible.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, these are all technical indicators. there are many more aspects that understanding business, accounting, and economics will address but this is a good place to start. A great example of this is $SLM on October 24th of this year. it hit the highest and lowest point that it had reached that month within a single day. using these idicators I was able to buy at the absolute lowest price available and sell for $1.50 higher per share 2 days later. 

with 100 shares I made $150 on that trade then went to work and made the same amount. if you study and work hard, trading truly can become a supplementary or full-time income.

&amp;#x200B;

if you understand these concepts you can also use this method for shorting stocks",2019-11-05
