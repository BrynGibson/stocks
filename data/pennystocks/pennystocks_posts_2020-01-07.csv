Up 2.72% after this one day of selling.  I'm playing low, real fucking low.  I see some comments here that people have 1000s of shares.  Like, are people spending hundreds of dollars on these stocks?  I saw INPX at 18 cents. That is 180 dollars, already more than I decided to start with lol.  I'm having fun reading and watching, and having a good first go at it.  My goal is to be able to spend that kind of capital from gains made from this loe account.

5,HUSA on the 'move',el3let,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/el3let/husa_on_the_move/,1,37,"Hey all. I hope you guys cashed big on INPX, and those got out too late you have my sympathy. Believe me it's nobody's fault other than the CEO himself. Quite honestly I find it repulsive to hurt stockholders trust by deciding to go with a reverse split. 

On a different note I mean taking a look at, HUSA with overnight activity and its chart. While I do want to believe this is not a pump and dump, instead I consider this one another good outside bar chart similar to LLEX as well. I would have bid on ZN today but I rather have my money played in HUSA more than ZN because realistically ... The whole biblical oil searching sounds a bit too much for my rationality taste.  

HUSA also holds a long black candle on the daily chart which indicates the bulls are in control of this chart, held above the 0.20 support, with a resistance of 0.26.

**Just started trading around 3 weeks ago and have managed my way to doubly my robinhood investment of $525, and finally get back to positive on my TDA account of $3500 (mainly use it to day trade but have found the robinhood account has led me to be more patient and not panic sell bc of the day trade rule). Along with a $60 gain on bluechip stocks on cash app (800inv)

Anyways I feel very lucky as I think most of it was from $INPX, $FCEL, $ZN, and $HUSA seems to be coming. I lost a lot on $FCEL‚Äôs drop because I thought it would go back up and got out of $INPX after it stayed at .46 all day (thank God) prior to it dropping to .18.**

I have a meeting tomorrow at 9:30, usually lasts an hour.. not sure if I should hold the volatile oil stocks like ZN, ROYT, HUSA, etc. - and I‚Äôm not sure what an appropriate stop loss is to avoid a dip that just goes right back up. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äútake profits‚Äù with penny stocks, but also - taking profits would have been silly with the way some of these popular penny stocks are going 

Tldr I don‚Äôt want lose on ZN and I like my Gains but not sure how low the dip will be, what should my stop loss be if my avg is .35(ZN) and HUSA(.19) ROYT(.67) - I haven‚Äôt figured out reasonable dips yet",2020-01-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/el5l54/stop_sell_price_zn_husa_oils/
