And I couldn't even find what the rumor is. It's a short squeezed chart. Hopefully it doesn't go full crazy like $DRYS or $BPTH. I'll be covering my short that I did at market close if it looks strong in pre-market hours on Monday.

Hopefully they release some ""news"" on Monday morning which nobody cares about, and everyone who is long, panics and sells.",2019-10-26

Yesterday Chinas president made a huge announcement about how China plans to start adopting and utilizing blockchain (Google ‘China Blockchain’). XNET is one of the only microcap Chinese companies that has large involvement in blockchain, so naturally it spiked largely.

This is similar to when big announcements in bitcoin would be made in the US, RIOT would spike largely.",2019-10-26

With a cash account you can trade w/o PDT restrictions but you can only trade half the value of your portfolio each day if you want to be able to trade *every* day. But trading more than half your portfolio each day seems unnecessary to me. I started w/ a small account ($1500) and now that I have over $25K in my account I still use a cash account. I don’t need it all everyday, half is plenty enough for my strategy. But I do get everyone’s gripe, I don’t use margin but I assume that’s a big issue here.",2019-10-26

10,RealStratBeckerYT,f5aufhg,/r/pennystocks/comments/dn6w4r/concern_with_xnet/f5aufhg/,1,"I see that now. But isn't the sheer volume amount completely irregular even if that was a thing that some people knew? It's the highest daily volume level ever over 30,000% above normal levels",2019-10-26
11,Hummerz_96,f5b6vgd,/r/pennystocks/comments/dn6w4r/concern_with_xnet/f5b6vgd/,1,"First, if you adjust the volume for the price that it was trading at, then it is not the largest amount that it's traded. Yesterday, It traded \~60 mil shares around $3-5, but in the past traded 30 mil shares one day at $16-18. So, that day it traded more in dollars than yesterday. 

Second, irregular volume doesn't really correlate to a stock being over or undervalued. It just means that a large enough announcement happened to convince others to trade the stock.

The stock in the long term has been a straight line down, so I think it will eventually crash, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a chance of doubling or tripling in the very short term just from the hype of blockchain.",2019-10-26
