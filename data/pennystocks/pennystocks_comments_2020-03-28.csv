While stem cells is not my area of expertise, I probably have more education in this that most people here. Happy to defer to someone with more experience in the field. 

We've had stem cell ""treatments"" for well over 10 years now. The reason there are actually very few treatments approved and on the market is because we don't have good success in getting them to do what we want them to do. You also can't always control what else they do. What happens if the cells start doing other things you ask? Short and simple, they'll usually become cancer. 

Right now: We don't know the extent of the dammage caused by COVID19. We also don't know how it's being caused, in how many people, and what the long term implications are. We just know that there is limited evidence that some long term damage might be happening. We also don't have the resources to really study this right now since the building is still on fire and we're just going to focus on putting out the fire first.

No doctor would try and treat an unknown damage, while it's still being caused. You would also NEVER rapidly deploy a stem cell treatment. Not only is it unnecessary, it would be very dangerous. Stem cell treatments need to undergo rigorous safety and efficacy trails (where 99.9% of them fail). It really just makes no logical sense to start treating what will be chronic damage while the person is still infected. It could actually stress their body even more leading to increased mortality. 

Finally, we can barely treat simple tissue damage in joints with stem cells. That doesn't bode well for a treating a complicated vital organ where we still don't even know the extent and characteristics of the damage being caused. 

And just for emphasis because it's the dumbest thing I've heard all week. YOU WOULD NEVER RAPIDLY DEPLOY AN UNPROVEN STEM CELL TREATMENT. 

This is absolutely the worst attempt to jump on the COVID19 train I've seen all month. Any new treatment (stem cell or otherwise) to treat the damage caused is at least 5 years away in a best case scenario.",2020-03-28

The key difference is the timeline. Multistem has been going through clinical trails which takes years and following the normal validation process. They've been working on this specific application for years and they don't appear to have changed their timeframe or made any wild claims. The only thing I've found on their website relevant to the current crisis is that they say it might be applicable to COVID19. They aren't pumping it as this miracle cure. They're only suggesting that it could increase demand for the stuff they've been working on for years. 

They also aren't making any claims about rapid deployment. They have a set timeframe and process, and they haven't changed that based on the current events. They received fast track designation over a years ago which means it was based on evidence, not current events urgency. 

I can't predict if they'll succeed or fail, however they seem like a legitimate company who may have just gotten lucky by timing. I was also not suggesting that all stem cell treatments are scams, but rather that most of them fail and those that do succeed take years to validate and deploy. If you look at multistem, they support this given how long they've been working at it and despite the current crisis, they haven't changed their outlook or timeframe.

May be a while until people like what they see but the longer this drags on the more riskier this stock may be, they may not get the sale numbers they want, the product has QA issues, or a competitor has a better test kit who knows.",2020-03-28

It went back down and leveled out shortly after. It's still up a lot for what I put into it and as long as it doesn't crash and burn, I can do pretty well with it.
