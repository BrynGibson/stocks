4,I've decided to go long for IGC,c0fo4t,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/c0fo4t/ive_decided_to_go_long_for_igc/,0,8,"Understandably, seems cannabis is the biggest interest in the field of every possible thing you can think of; therapy, medicinal use, etc. The company with a market cap of 33.65 mils, authentic of its existence not located in some ... strange apartment.
