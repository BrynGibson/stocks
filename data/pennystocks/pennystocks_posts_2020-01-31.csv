10,Medmen announces today that Toxic CEO Adam Bierman has resigned.,ewqzdt,love_money_guru,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ewqzdt/medmen_announces_today_that_toxic_ceo_adam/,1,16,"Medmen is up today and currently trading @ $0.59 cents CDN at the time of this post.

Today they announced that Adam Bierman will step down as the CEO of the company.

This is good for a number of reasons...

1. Adam has been very toxic to Medmen's share price since the IPO a few years ago. His bonuses were ridiculous and his compensation was enormous.
2. He is giving up control of the company by eliminating his and the other co-founders 'super voting shares'
3. Medmen has recently undergone some restructuring which will cut their costs down significantly.
4. With Adam gone and super voting shares gone, this company can start moving forward with a new CEO at the helm.

Not professional advice, and I am currently invested in Medmen $MMNFF $MMEN but I do believe if this company pulls through on the next few Quarterly earnings that we will easily see this between $3-5 per share by late 2020.

Thanks for reading and here is today's new release.

13,Gold Junior Signs $9M Financing and Selects Targets,ewq86i,SureSpeech5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ewq86i/gold_junior_signs_9m_financing_and_selects_targets/,1,0,"GUYANA GOLDSTRIKE SIGNS US$9 MILLION GOLD FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Guyana Goldstrike Inc. GYA.V / GYNAF has signed a definitive gold forward purchase agreement dated Jan. 24, 2020, with an arm's-length investor for proceeds of up to $9-million (U.S.) for the Marudi gold project, located in Guyana, South America.

Under the terms of the agreement, the investor will make an initial payment of $2-million (U.S.) on or before April 14, 2020. Thereafter, a second payment of $7-million (U.S.) will be advanced within 30 days of a royalty interest in the project in favour of the investor having been registered.

The agreement is non-dilutive to the company's current share structure as no shares or warrants will be issued to the investor. The proceeds will enable the company to finalize its purchase of the project and further explore and develop the resource potential of the property.

In consideration for providing financing, the company has agreed to deliver 30,000 ounces of gold, representing approximately 10 per cent of the project's current mineral resource estimate (please see mineral resource estimates section herein). Deliveries will commence within 120 days of a declaration of commercial production from the project, or within 36 months of the initial financing under the agreement, whichever is the earlier, with an annual delivery schedule of 3,000 ounces. The company has also agreed to grant the investor a right of first refusal to acquire a further 30,000 ounces of gold, on terms to be negotiated between the parties.

The delivery obligation of the company will be secured by a 12.5-per-cent net smelter return royalty in favour of the investor, to be registered against the project. The royalty will not be payable while the company meets the delivery schedule and will expire once all delivery obligations under the agreement have been satisfied.
