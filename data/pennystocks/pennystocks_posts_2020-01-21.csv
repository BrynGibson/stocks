Hello to all!

I have a question. Why all oil extracting companies lowered their stocks with 10-20% for just a week and around 50-80% for a year when the oil price hasn't dropped in a year as well as in the last week. Why are the graphs not related? Example companies are Chesapeake Energy, Denbury Resources and Southwestern Energy.

Chesapeake is the best example as it looks like a staircase and like it wouldn't cost more than 0.30$ in a year...",2020-01-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/es2dv2/oil_price_doesnt_affect_oil_companies/

I am new to the stock market. Right now I am using redditb of course, and my experience and knowledge in biology to decide on small but promising investments. 

Both of these companies I mentioned in the headline accomplished important steps recently, the first completing a second phase 3 trial for a new hep b vaccine, which may surpass the current gold standard vaccine in North America, planning to start distributing it by the mid of he year. The second has announced today that a lung cancer drug they developed was aproved by the FDA and might go through a fast track, and may be used to treat other cancers if I am not wrong. 

While buying is almost an easy decision, based on this information, when should I sell? I am following up daily in these companies now (atleast vibv) to see if there are any developments, but are there any speculation on the  best time to sell?

Thank you!",2020-01-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/erwoje/vbiv_and_gnpx/
