46,Slightly_Damaged_Car,ep6xr6m,/r/pennystocks/comments/bu3uug/trading_advice_newbie/ep6xr6m/,1,"My guess since you are new and posting on the penny stocks forum is that you see a stock that is up a big 8-10% and you buy in hoping for a win and then it goes back down you sell and you are out money. That or you are getting scared when a little dip happens and are selling out before waiting for the price to go back up.

If you are going to keep playing with pennystocks. Do research about past performance, and what the price is currently. If it is really high its probably not a good idea to buy. If the stock is trending up, buy a when it dips and hold it until you get an increase. Or if its a constant price stock and trading at lets say 1.25 all the time but dips to 1.20 buy in and sell when it comes back to its normal range. Penny stocks can make big margins but also lose big. I have a list of penny stocks that I Limit buy in and Limit sell all the time because they fluctuate fairly regularly.

If you are just getting into trading you make have more luck learning with index funds or larger stocks that are mostly guaranteed to be trending up, so even if you are stuck bagholding for a while the price will eventually go back up, some penny stocks go up 40% in a day but those same stocks are almost 100% guaranteed to go down in the long run, meaning it is very hard to get on the winning big side of trades, and really easy to lose out.

If you are truly new to this, you may feel more comfortable using a trading simulator like [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/) to get some feel for things without using your own real money.

Penny stocks are in many many cases a sham and subject to a lot of manipulation, so be wary of this -- the swings can cause more damage in a penny stock than owning stock from a larger exchange.  This is because you can buy so many shares at pennies versus a few shares for dollars.  That is the draw as well -- an upswing can be hugely satisfying if you have a lot of shares BEFORE it happens, but you have to expect that you'll not always have the market go the direction you want it to.

Sometimes it pays to simply create a watch list and look at the patterns over time to see if there's something you can take advantage of.  I've seen many stocks swing periodically and with enough forethought and some luck, you can figure out when things are in a trough to buy rather than buying as things are rising (and potentially nearing the end of a climb).

It takes patience - this is something many folks can't deal with because of the prospect of instant gains.  Researching some of the investments you want to make is very helpful -- you can read publicly available filings and get a better feel for the state of a company.  If you learn to read financial statements, this can provide a wealth of insight into how a company operates and whether their outlook is good, bad, or even if what they are saying is garbage to appease investors.

Bottom line is that there is no ""silver bullet"" to investing that I'm aware of -- but there are some strategies to tip scales in your favor some of the time, and luck seems to play a significant part as well...",2019-05-28
