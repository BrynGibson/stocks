Summer is 2018 was when all available chemo-therapy treats were exhausted on him and stopped working to stop the cancer. By January of 2019 his bone marrow was 98% cancerous and he was expected to die within months. Now, why am I telling you this? Because in March 2019 he started a clinical trial for cancer treatment at the **Swedish Cancer institute in Seattle**, and as of June 10th, he's cancer free. No signs of the cancer in his bone marrow biopsy, no signs of the cancer in his blood, and now signs of the cancer in his urine. They haven't officially said it because they have to see if come back within the year but the clinical trial looks like a cure.  So, there's that is you want to start looking at companies associated with cancer treatments.",2019-06-12
