23,born2rock4life,ekrylkx,/r/pennystocks/comments/bckufe/who_here_has_bought_timothy_sykes_vip_program_and/ekrylkx/,1,"I can attest that what he teaches is extremely profitable. Also look up Steven Dux and William Karajan. Both share his strategies, and Steven was a student of Timothy Sykes who turned his $20k into $970k within 13 months. He has a lot of great content/DVD’s that teach everything from shorting, penny stocks, reading SEC filings, basics and fundamentals, and more. If you follow what he teaches and not just copy cat what he trades live, you will find success. 

Anyone saying he is a scam either doesn’t agree with his style, doesn’t like his character (he can be abrasive, but is bluntly honest,) and/or most likely has never been involved in his programs and teaching.

He gives the basic secrets to his style away in this interview I linked below, and I would say judge for yourself based on whether or not his style appeals to you. Everyone has a method that works best for them, and the more you hone in on a style and perfect it, the more consistent you will become and more profitable as well.

He teaches both long and short methodologies, so even if shorting isn’t your ideal style, you can still find other programs and lessons of his that teach long strategies, scalping, etc.

I haven’t had the extra income to invest in his challenge myself, but I’ve watched most all of the content while at a friends house and can speak to this as a review. I’ve since become more consistent in attaining profits, quicker and less emotional about cutting losses quickly, and many other key elements that makes the difference in becoming part of the 10% of traders who don’t fail.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions further, or reply in-line and I’d be glad to answer them.

As far as his credibility; Tim, Steven, and others share their profits for all to see on www.profit.ly so anyone can verify his success independently. 

He is transparent about what he does and emphasizes that anyone who teaches should be, as everybody can have a Green Day, but that doesn’t mean they are consistently profitable / not losing more money than they’re profiting overall.

My review was intended to inform people, not convince them to buy the course. Someone who has $100k to start would benefit greatly from the material and the investment to them is far less than risking it all and taking a small 2-3% loss.

Granted most of us penny stockers start with much smaller capital investments, which is why I emphasized watching the interview to learn a few things from his style, as it’s freely accessible on YouTube.

I can understand why he relinquished after people flamed the post, much like you’re doing without giving feedback on his strategies. You want to lump him into the category you’re painting with broad strokes, which is fine if you have credibility and can back that up. 

But you aren’t even critiquing what he teaches, which tells me you likely don’t know anything about the course, haven’t partaken in it, and are here despite that to voice your opinion. Go right ahead, but that’s pretty ignorant to spread misinformation assuming you haven’t.

31,HodlGang_HodlGang,eksedmw,/r/pennystocks/comments/bcmwx2/to_the_person_who_wanted_a_timothy_sykes_review/eksedmw/,1,"I’m opposed to advising that in order to learn to trade successfully, one must follow a gurus teaching or ‘strategies’ - not necessarily Tim specifically - but in this case, Tim and any of the other YouTube trading gurus you’ve mentioned. 

I’d recommend people experiment and find what they like to trade, and then go from there. For example, learning to trade options is something Tim doesn’t teach, and yet options are often more volatile than penny stocks - and they’re tradeable in highly liquid stocks like amzn. 

Which mean your strategies can scale further than they could in penny stocks. Where liquidity is often less than $50 million per day - why would you want to pigeonhole yourself by staking all your initial time and money learning penny stocks from Tim. 

He’ll admit that it’s not something you can trade millions of dollars in. Let’s assume it’s all true for a moment - making $10k/ week sounds great -  but you really need a 6 figure account for that to be even remotely possible. 

And don’t forget 90% of traders lose money consistently. Which includes every one of Tim’s subscribers. Just because you’re watching some YouTube gurus videos, or paying them money, means you’re automatically inducted into the special 10% of winners.

&gt;why he relinquished after people flamed the post, much like you’re doing without giving feedback on his strategies. 

You mean the strategy which surmounts to buy the pump, and short the dump? All the support resistance, patterns, breakouts, break downs, washouts, cut losses quickly, higher highs, lower lows, 10% gap scanner... I could go on? - I still would not recommend paying or subscribing to Tim or any other Profit.ly gurus. Nor even trying to copy what they’re doing, because you’re “trading education” shouldn’t be learning to follow what some guru tells you to do. 

That’s not learning, that’s following. 

&gt;But you aren’t even critiquing what he teaches, which tells me you likely don’t know anything about the course, haven’t partaken in it, and are here despite that to voice your opinion. 

Tim and his gurus all sell several courses. Exactly how much money and time must one spend to satisfy you?

I’m objective to his claim that if you pay him money, in return he’ll teach you “How to make Millions” which is a claim he makes as the title of one of his most popular courses. So yeah, I know a bit about the guy....

&gt;Go right ahead, but that’s pretty ignorant to spread misinformation assuming you haven’t.

Because, in order for you to assume you’re right, you must first assume I’m misinformed. Which is an awfully convenient argument....

It’s cool that it has sec filings right there but he’s charging retarded money for information you get with almost any broker software you can find the sec filings for free on nasdaq.com as well as many many many other sites.

Profitly is interesting but I mean really you can find trade ideas by using a gap scanner and looking at the top% gainers on literally any site including nasdaq for free.

He always brags about his free content on YouTube. I’ve watched all of Stevens videos and all of grittanis and sykes are by far the biggest pile of shit. Why ? Maybe because I don’t want to hear : hi my name is time Sykes I trade from crazy places my millionaire students my millionaire students my millionaire students for 9 minutes on 200 videos with no actual content on the video except that. You don’t even get what’s in the title. The only free content he has that is worth a damn is trader checklist.

Why would I pay 9 grand to listen to someone that is supposed to be a millionaire use the goddamn mic in his laptop( millionaire can’t even buy a fucking mic) while he taps away on his keyboard with the worst audio on earth.

Same problem with dux and grtanni but they actually give out information on their trades.

I was going to try out his trader challenge or penny stocking silver but once I heard the attached price tag I said (nah this isn’t for me) and buddies like well you could float the cost on your credit card! I was like ok this is so scammy it is not even funny. The constant spam emails you get with links to seminars that are actually just his YouTube videos with bots in a chat. 

Then I watched all the podcasts his first student made and while some people make money a lot of them lose as well on his program so it’s not exactly fool proof. 

He now makes almost all his money from teaching and man oh man it’s a fuckload. 

The reason I find him scammy above and beyond that is because he could easily fake his trades these days as he owns the software he posts to and he owns the software he posts from. He uploaded his tax returns but that would be really easy to fake.


All in all if you do pay for his content there’s a lot of good stuff in his DVD’s but you can get it pretty much anywhere for free. Like how to read sec filings there’s billions of free videos and websites. Like Steven dux says 90% of the content he and other traders put out is completely useless. But combining all of the 10%’s make a useful way to trade.

$ATBPF / ATE.V - This is a /r/pennystocks favorite and for good reason since they have a very easy to understand drug pipeline with the potential to completely replace existing NSAIDs (first), certain opiods, and even aspirin with a safer alternative.  Phase 2 results on the NSAID replacement were phenomenal.  Their [investor presentation](http://www.antibethera.com/wordpress/pdf/presentations/Antibe%20Investor%20Presentation%20-%20February%202019.pdf) explains everything quite clearly and since it's just pain killers you do not need to be a medical expert to understand the implications.  Only downside is that they've issued tons of warrants over the years so there's lots of dilution but it shouldn't matter too much if their drug makes it to market.

$EYEN - Interesting IPO from 2018 with 3 Phase 3 drugs in the pipeline along with an OTC product they plan to start selling in 2019.  Again, it's a super-easy to understand drug company; they're trying to replace eye-droppers with a sophisticated spray device that allows them to deliver smaller dosages.  One side-effect of the smaller dose size is that it unlocks some already-known drugs which are not widely used because they cause side-effects at higher doses via eye-drops.  It was a super compelling buy at $2.50 in December because they had about $2/share in cash at the time... but even at ~$5 I think it's worth looking at when you consider the size of market they could address (their myopia product could be massive in China but that'll be more like 2021 timeframe).

$SCON - If you're patient enough and have the nerves to survive the dilutions this one could some day be a 1000 bagger.  They are one of only a couple companies with the specialized manufactoring capability to produce some new barium copper oxide rare-earth superconducting wire (the wire which composes most of a new generation of high-energy superconducting electromagnet that can operate with liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium).  There's a lot of interest from the military, utilities, and cutting-edge electric power startups.  I view $SCON as a way to get indirect investment access to MIT's new Commonwealth Fusion Systems startup (Bill Gates is an investor) since they will need massive quantities of this wire if they are successful in their new fusion design.  The high-temperature superconducting magents are *the fundamental physics advancement* that enables the possibility of a small-radius (i.e. inexpensive) tokamak fusion reactor.  The time scales for this investment are decades though; and specifically for next year or two $SCON will have to keep diluting the stock so just keep it on your watchlist; it looks like they could see serious revenue by 2021 though.  I have a very small position just so that I have some exposure and never forget about it.  The price is definitely compelling at a $5MM market cap considering this could easily become a &gt;100 million revenue company some day.",2019-04-13

Gripes aside with the audio recordings (I am a professional musician, so I loathe the audio clipping heard in the short stocking DVD series,) his material is useful when it comes to learning.

I agree the cost of the challenge is more than I would pay without h I get the income to dispose, which is why I haven’t joined yet myself. Once I have the means, I will, but more so to give credit where it’s due since I’ve seen most of his stuff free as I mentioned. The subscription based approach is good and I think a better bet for most. While his watchlist is one thing you said is useful, you are correct that you can do it all yourself for free. I use ThinkOrSwim scanners and never rely on anyone else for watchlists, which he encourages also in his videos, As does Steven, which he mentions he does in the interview.

I’m a huge advocate of free education myself, and anyone with a little tech savvyness can find torrents on the pirates of the bay with most of the content. I don’t advise such, but just saying.

I also read his book thingy that he always advertises is free, more like a magazine that just has some common sense stuff in there nothing really useful.

Free education is awesome but for people to pay you have to put out quality stuff. Also knowing people who are successful isn’t worth that money.

I agree with a lot of what you say. I’ve learned from many people, books, strategies in all the content, etc. and doing that and finding what worked best for me is why I speak up and provided the review I did. I don’t care if you believe me, that I’m profitable, or otherwise. I’ve achieved success (and not just in trading,) but am simply trying to help inform the person’s whose original post was deleted, and for others who wanted to see a review otherwise.

That said, I’ve had many $1-2k days, and that was when I was at $5-10k capital. Six figures is far from necessary to see these kinds of gains. Maybe for blue chips that move 3-5% on a daily basis at most, but surely not volatile penny stocks.

Options are a great thing, and as you mentioned can be highly liquid while dealing with larger sums of capital. The purpose of the post being in the penny stock subreddit forum is because most of the times people trading them don’t have lots of capital, and given that, slippage isn’t something they’re likely to experience when buying and selling since they’re not making orders for hundreds of thousands or millions of share at once.

As far as learning what to do, rather than learning the principles of why they do what they do, you are correct. If you copy cat their trades and not understand the underlying reasons they make the trades, then you’re setting yourself up to get stuck bag holding/taking losses in volatile penny stocks. If you know the skills and think for yourself, you will find yourself ahead of the game, so to speak.

As far as paying for him to teach you how to make millions, isn’t that pretty much what college does? Except most people spend tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, which they pay interest on top of. They’re scams too, just because most people don’t make millions? Tim openly states that so far only 6 students of his have become millionaires, so he’s not misleading, just stating the possibility. He isn’t guaranteeing that is the case for everyone.

Never mind that’s why Aaron Schwartz shared so much knowledge for free that he downloaded from MIT. So people could obtain knowledge and make use of it. What Tim proposes is no different, and he advises learning everything you can, particularly for the same reasons with the internet having all of the material for free if you look hard enough.",2019-04-13

To the unexperienced trader, they may not recognize what's beneficial as they aren't experienced and aren't aware of what they're looking for, and you can't blame them

As far as the programs he, Steven, or any guru puts together and sells, they all do so to help people, but of course are putting a price on the work they put into it. Their time is valuable.  I personally recommend the book ""The Market Whisperer,"" for those who want a cheap/free approach to learn the basics and fundamentals, as it's free with a 30-day trial on Amazon Kindle Unlimited. However, Steven does disclose why he's entered trades, though his English isn't the best it does explain why he entered the trade. William Karaman as well. I only speak to people I've watched and learned from, then applied which has given me better success. I can't say much for many other content creators because I don't know them or their programs, and you won't see me doing so, as I believe providing an opinion on something I'm not educated upon is doing a disservice.

If people are looking for free resource otherwise, I'd recommend ""EatSleepProfit"" YouTube channel. He shows the basics of what penny stocking is, how to setup scanners/find news, etc. But that wasn't the point of my post, which I restate is to provide a review to someone who asked for one yesterday when their post was deleted/removed particular to Tim Sykes.

As far as news; FinViz is great, and they have good charts/scanners built-in. I also use SeekingAlpha for news and TheFly.  I use https://volumebot.com to identify short volume which is free.  Outside of that, my scanner setup was built off the framework from the guy I mentioned earlier's youtube channel, EatSleepProfit. It does the job well for finding low float, low cap stocks with volume in order to find potential runner candidates, gap-ups, etc.",2019-04-13

Colleges generally make the claim that you can get a job in specific areas of study given you earn a degree form their school. But when it comes to making millions, the odds of finding a job which will get you there are very small. In reality, you probably need to start a business. And from personal experience, studying business, and conducting successful business are two very different things which no school can prepare you for. Some things you just can’t learn in classrooms. That said, I do think schools are primarily scamming students if they don’t actually lead to related careers, which is all too common. 

&gt;Never mind that’s why Aaron Schwartz shared so much knowledge for free that he downloaded from MIT. So people could obtain knowledge and make use of it. 

Following your logic, Aaron would more likely be the one to pirate and distribute Tim’s videos rather than advise people to pay money. 

I’ll just restate my objections aren’t with Tim’s teaching. I object to the validity of certain claims he makes, and I object to paying to learn a subject where the teacher knows 90% of students will fail. 

He doesn’t qualify or filter his students at all to weed out the 90% which are destined to fail. Of course not - he’d be cutting his revenue by 90% if he did that - so of course he takes their money anyways, and tells you anyone can be a millionaire if you follow his teachings   - which at best is only 10% true - and it’s no wonder he makes no guarantees - 

So yeah, I think Tim runs a shady business.",2019-04-13

I for one was a Sys Admin and then engineer all through self-learning, Ceres, and compounding experience. Unfortunately many careers require a degree, not to mention pay far less than the tech industry, like teaching for example.

RE the Aaron Schwartz reply; you can find Tim Sykes content for free online. He knows that and advises people to access as much as they can since the internet provides the content for free. He likely wasn’t intending that to mean pirating his material, but regardless, it’s available if sought out.

He runs a business, and at least is honest about it being there to make money. He has the costs stated upfront, and recites the fact numerous times that 90% fail.

I guess comparing it to what many penny stock companies do when they lie to their shareholders and say things are great right before filing bankruptcy, R/S and then selling warrants and grays, etc. I wouldn’t call it shady, just not well-liked. Plenty of companies we have on the boards and try to profit from, whether long or short, are only looking to ensure their financial gain and not share holders.

I’m cautious about Canadian companies that are just starting out because I feel that in the relatively near future there could possibly be overproduction of weed in the country and that could cause problems for the smaller grow ops, possibly putting some of them out of business. 



In the US, craft beers are really blowing up in terms of popularity and if Canada is similar in that respect then I could see something like craft weed doing well even in an over saturated market but I’m not sure if there are companies like that exactly. Also the market might have to mature a bit before that picks up.
