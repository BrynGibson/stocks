Transparent Trader, your website sucks just as much as your DD... But nothing sucks as much as your pump and dumps.",2019-05-18

Yes. I think this company is the real deal. They have a product you can buy, right now. I believe they will be in retail stores in North America in the next 6 months.",2019-05-18

5,Tricombed,eod3gle,/r/pennystocks/comments/bq374m/massive_dd_package_for_otc_ticker_gmgi/eod3gle/,1,"They diluted to pay off of convertible debt and then the CEO bought all those shares to keep the O/S the same. 

So they currently have no debt, have stated they do not plan on doing an R/S,  have over $700k in revs the last quarter up 100s% since last year, and are not actually losing money. 

They are in a position pretty much unheard of for a penny stock. 

Also itâ€™s not his DD he just reposted someone elseâ€™s work.",2019-05-18
