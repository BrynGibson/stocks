5,How come a company that loses money still hiring,e5hiz9,drcyber94,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e5hiz9/how_come_a_company_that_loses_money_still_hiring/,1,4,"Ok so I need to understand something , so please if you can just help it will be great. 

The thing is that there is a company that loses more money than it's generating quarterly (more than 2x) but still it's hiring more people while it's stock is below 0.3 cents. (Market cap just 10 mil) expenses near 5 millions
Revenues ~ 2.2 millions

So ....... How can this be a good idea to hire more and generate in such a critical time and burn more money?",2019-12-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/e5hiz9/how_come_a_company_that_loses_money_still_hiring/
