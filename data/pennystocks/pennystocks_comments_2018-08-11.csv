They used a labor intensive method to target their ""good wheat"" traits. These initialized the breeding program and have been improved to the elite cultivar status of high yield, disease resistance, and quality baking and taste. This is why they will have an edge over competitors. It takes a long time to build in novel traits like these. Apparently they had foresight about the 'celical disease epidemic' and selected these traits years before it became a hot button issue.

 Arcadia’s RG product is a non-GM, patent-pending, identity preserved specialty wheat in which allergenic glutens have been reduced by 75 percent and overall gluten content has been reduced by 60 percent. At the same time, the levels of glutens important for bread-making are not changed.  

They have a Resistant Starch line as well which acts as high fiber bread that is also good for the microbiome ( they claim) which if true is also a big shtick, more realistic than the low-gluten but that will bring in the PR.

The products that use their wheat will have a ""GOOD WHEAT"" stamp on it similar to the Non-GMO butterfly you've seen adding a premium to products using it

&gt;what other wheat is currently doing this? 

Technically no, however there have been groups who made use of a novel hybridization betwen durum wheat (standard bread wheat) and wild barley to acheive something similar. This is a shortcut and has the consequences you mention of affecting characteristics of the baking and consumer tastes. Others are surely doing it, but it is unclear where in the 10-year breeding pipeline or which genetic targets they have focused on. The advantage comes from the NON-GM angle where they've been breeding exclusively with durum wheat for the past 10 years.

\&gt;  Another pretty large factor that shouldn’t be over looked is taste. I’m assuming all these will be answered after the testing that you talk about. 

Yes.

 \&gt;When exactly is that supposed to occur / will there be an article or write up published somewhere for it?  

From the latest confernce call: This is how wheat breeders have operated for decades. This is the final step to show that their long hard-work is valuable and they will be doing it now. I believe the low-gluten is a year behind. Since it is commercially available, that means Millers have been using it and will likely publicly announce a partnership with them, I believe in this next quarter. Perhaps exclusive rights to the good wheat brand, from the biggest miller in the U.S.

* Advancing GoodWheat Commercialization Plan. Arcadia’s focus in Q3 will be on building and expanding partnerships throughout the wheat supply chain with growers, seed companies, millers and food companies. The first product in the GoodWheat portfolio, Resistant Starch wheat, is anticipated to be commercially available in 2019, so these partnerships will be key to launching innovative wheat ingredients and forming the foundation of a long-term, sustainable business.",2018-08-11

This is just a guess based on what I witnessed from TNDM before they blew up. They did several dilutions in a short time frame, perhaps to cover liability insurance or something with the partnerships they've signed, I am not extremely familiar with business practices at this point of a company's life, but it wouldn't surprise me to see one more, but not two+",2018-08-11
