CVB has mines in Mali, Africa a gold hotspot. They struck gold on past occasions. More recently in there last assays they struck dirt with a few flakes of the good stuff. Why is this good do you ask?

This is good cause it gives you and I more shares on the cheap. So get at it.

I was swinging it for months so I haven't lost any money but I could have kept large profits and I didn't. It was a calculated risk that didn't pay off and not an emotional move, so I'm disappointed with the results, but not so much my choices. 

It was obviously a mistake expecting news at the conference but I still think it was a reasonable expectation and not FOMO. Even without news, I didn't expect a fall-back this hard, all things considered. I do think this is now oversold and will rebound some on its own.

Hopefully, with two more conferences and the filling of the P3 trial expected this month, it reverses and begins an upward trend so I can exit.

If I can get out at or near profit on this current trade, any time before May, I will. The P3 results aren't until June and there should be re-entries before then. Otherwise, I'm taking it up to P3 results.

OGEN

Another swing stock for me so I'm actually still up pretty nicely. I was so focused on the ONTX conference presentation, I missed my exit(s) on OGEN. I also didn't know OGEN presented so early in the day for some odd reason. Next time I'll use a stop-loss. Not sure why I didn't have one in place as I usually do other than distractions.

They present P2 results in late Q12020 so I'm staying in and will probably add if I get to exit ONTX soon.

There is a higher risk of further dilution than with ONTX so a lower entry may be in the works. Hopefully, they go through P2 without it.

Hey, these are the risks we take in bio-pennies! I accept that. If you got out with a profit, congrats! If not, I wouldn't panic sell either of them.
