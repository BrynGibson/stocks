They need to continue cutting cost as well as cutting/selling stores that don‚Äôt do well and strategically opening ones in good locations.  I also want them to continue to cut down on inventory and found on what items sell and which don‚Äôt and cut those that don‚Äôt.  Next they need to advertise like they did last year and be aggressive with it.
