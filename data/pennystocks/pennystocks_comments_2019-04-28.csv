He sets up fake free web seminars and sends them to you in emails constantly and when u watch them they are just YouTube video that has chat bots.

His platform stocks to trade is glitchy and slow as all fuck and constantly disconnects. And it’s 179p/m it’s pretty shit. It has some cool features but every other broker software has them minus float sec and tweets.

He sets his advertisements up for his trader challenge so : we pick u if you are determined. But he charges you 9 grand. 
His base program is 2 grand a year.

Now on top of that he says he gives away butt loads of free content on YouTube. If you’ve ever watched a Tim Sykes YouTube video you’ll know what I’m talking about. It’s a clickbaite title, but when you watch the video it’s him talking for 9 minutes about his millionaire students where he trades from or his cars the title content is nowhere to be found.

All of his content is a data funnel designed to make you buy his program because he gives you no info anywhere else. He does throw out one small nine that’s worth a damn. His trader checklist.

He’s also a cunt who pretends like he’s saving everyone or something. He’s not a complete idiot but all that he teaches is pretty basic like how to read secs news emotions of stock trading. 

His whole philosophy can be summed up in a few sentences:

Trade low float stocks with an avg vol of 200,000. Trade panics and reversals. React to the stock market.
Everything he offers is free you just have to look for it.

If your a trader with about 25000 or more check him out his program is hella expensive so before you even get to market half your money will be gone. All his traders started with 15-30 dollars as did he so don’t let him fool you with that tiny account stuff. Grittani blew up his 1500 dollar account and borrowed 15 grand from his parents.

To sum up. Will you make money with Sykes? Maybe the ones who succeeded probably would have made it in their own anyway. The rest of his students make a little or fail and quit.
 

I’ve haven’t purchased his program but I have used stocks to trade trial for 14 days for 7$. I just can’t justify spending that much on info I can get anywhere. Nasdaq.com is free as is your broker software when you set up an account. I’ve made money on my own.",2019-04-28

He is giving brutal advice to be honest. I know nothing about this stock other than a couple small pieces.
A reverse split doesn’t indicate anything other than an attempt to prop up the visualized share value for a stock. 
49.5 million shares outstanding, so there is not much room to reverse to in my opinion. 

Who care if they reverse split. Look for info whether the company is sustainable. Also, you’re holding a stock which rates -$2.21 EPS. Over the course of the last year, has lost 91% of its value. It’s been negative since a month after IPO. 

You are holding a time bomb friend.
