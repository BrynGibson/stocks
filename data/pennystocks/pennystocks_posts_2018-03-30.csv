5,Why does everyone here seem to invest in penny stocks rather than treat them as the volatile stock that they are?,888r8g,acorneyes,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/888r8g/why_does_everyone_here_seem_to_invest_in_penny/,6,32,"I'm not saying I'm making a better choice or anything, I'm not even legally allowed to trade on the market, but I just see no one talking about shorting certain stocks, or only holding money in a company for a day and not more.

On simulations I find the volatility with CCI, then I look at the trend with RSI and 2 EMA lines and a BB. 

It's done me very well, and the whole point for me of penny stocks is exactly that volatility. It's got giant returns compared to some more premium stock like Amazon or AMD. 

In fact, despite being illegal, I see pump and dumps occuring constantly in penny stocks, and it's prime for shorting.",2018-03-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/888r8g/why_does_everyone_here_seem_to_invest_in_penny/
