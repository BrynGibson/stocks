“KemPharm has an extended runway into 2021. Here are 10 important points to consider.
1. They have cut their expenses to $1 million a quarter. With no new milestones they have more than enough cash into 2Q 2021 IMO.
2. Yes they have some $70 million in debt but with KVK they have $53 million in milestones and with  GPC another $483 million in milestones. With $536 million in milestones that debt could disappear very quickly!
3. GPC can file the  KP415 NDA any day now.
4. Apadaz sales started last November. KemPharm gets 30-50% of net profits.
5. GPC could file a KP484 IND at any time.
6. GPC also have options on KP879(SUD) and KP922 (amphetamine prodrug).
7. Deerfield have options on two prodrugs.
8. There are several more undisclosed partnerships which could enter the clinic this year.
9. Tax loss selling drove the share price down to the current silly levels. Once the share price is over $1 it should move up quickly.
10. KVK or GPC could easily take a partnership interest, or buyout the company...as could Takeda or other future competitors.”",2020-01-03

190,Harlequin_Winds,fcza7cr,/r/pennystocks/comments/ejngub/blozf_and_babyf/fcza7cr/,3,"I just posted about this company last night. I jumped on the BABYF bandwagon a while ago. There is just way too much potential to deny. There are no purely plant based formulas for toddlers, babies, or adults like this out there. According to the company they already have line-ups for the product(and it tastes good apparently). It is a known fact that dairy alternates such as soy can have negative effects on the reproductive system. And dairy has hormones and other contaminants in it from the livestock. So this plant based alternative will most likely attract hordes of parents and consumers. This product should alleviate the negatives surrounding soy alternates, lactose intolerant, those afraid of hormones, and the environmentally conscious, I am sure there are more reasons. 

Now the general consumer buying this product is a huge plus. But imagine this gets picked up in the healthcare industry. This stock will explode and fly to planet X where ever it is.

It is a gamble, but an educated gamble. Plant based foods are the future of foods whether we like it or not.

Only US brokers are subject to that 25,000 dollar day trading rule,  so you should still be able to day trade here with British brokers. The US brokers that I've seen are interactive brokers, sure trade, tradestation, tradestation global, tradezero, . Both tradezero and and suretrade bypass the PDT rule since they are offshore.

Reckon I'll go for either of the off shore ones, or maybe IG - and then move onto interactive brokers with 25k dollars. interactive brokers is easily the best broker.",2020-01-03
