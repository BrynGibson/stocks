i made 30k on this.  insider info is it will keep pumping tmrw and might hit 2-3 dollar share price in a week. massive gains

[https://www.google.com/search?q=cei+stock](https://www.google.com/search?q=cei+stock)

you  dont even have to take my word on it. look at the graph. after market  closed, in after market hours, the share price increased massively. a  pennystock never pumps up in after-market unless the insiders obviously  know its going to pump tmrw

buy at market open tmrw. get free gains. thank me later

out  of my 4 picks.  this stock has the highest percent chance of blasting  off tmrw. 99&amp;#37; chance to rip to new highs. the chance is so high everyone  smart is getting in during after market

2) CYPE

made  20k on this. i bought in yesterday. insider info is it will pump 2 more  days then have a massive dump. take gains for 2 days then sell off ASAP  on monday

3) PLG

insider info is this stock will hit 2-3 dollars within 2 months. their mines  have more platinum/gold than predicted. news release comes out in a  week. i got 100,000 shares for 9.5k a few days ago. price as increasing  in after market as insiders are loading up on shares

2,How do penny stocks work?,8un8ut,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8un8ut/how_do_penny_stocks_work/,1,5,"Hi Redditors. I am continuing my video project where I use Google’s search engine data to answer most asked questions and explain searched terms related to penny stocks

I thought not to make video to answer this question (how do penny stocks work?) because I thought I will not make more valuable information as given in previous videos but after thinking more about what person might be asking here I started to realise that what can be important to note for beginner trader is how penny stocks and stocks, in general, begin trading on stock exchanges or OTC markets. I will give a brief explanation about OTCs and regular stock exchange differences.

For the start, you need to understand IPO process. IPO or what is known as the initial public offering is when private company mostly with the help from investment bankers offer its stock to the public for the first time. These companies go public in order to raise capital for their business needs. Stock exchanges have listing rules which companies must satisfy in order to be listed on stocks exchanges. If company undergo IPO process successfully we can then trade them for the first time through our online stock brokers’ platforms.

Check it out some recent IPOs: [https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=pricings](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/activity.aspx?tab=pricings)

But most real penny stocks, these nano-cap stock companies (with market capitalization under 50 million dollars) do not satisfy listing rules because they are too small and IPO process itself is very expensive for these companies. The smallest companies that undergo this process is at least microcap stocks that are in a higher bracket (with the market cap from 100 to 500 millions dollars). Most of the time companies that undergo IPO have the market capitalization of at least over 300 million dollars when they start trading on a stock exchange but I saw stocks that get listed with lower first-day market capitalization.

But what to do for smaller companies that cannot be listed on stock exchanges due to lack of resources and size?

These companies can be listed on OTC markets. In USA “OTC Market Group” controls most of these OTC markets. But you might be interested to know how OTC differs from a regular exchange?

To simply put, trading on OTC markets is done through broker-dealers which act as market makers who quote stock prices for those who interested to trade it. Here explanation from Investopedia to get a better understanding: “On an exchange, every party is exposed to offers by every other counterparty, which may not be the case in dealer networks. There is less transparency and less stringent regulation on these exchange,"" so unsophisticated investors take on additional risk and could be subject to adverse conditions.”

In general OTC markets are less regulated and have less listing rules but in contrast, it is less expensive for small companies to get listed there. What is needed for a small company to get listed on OTC markets is to comply with OTC Market Group listing rules than to find broker-dealer which will need to fill form 211 to satisfy SEC rules and boom - stock is trading on OTC markets. We can know trade through our trading platforms.

But if you are interested to see some examples and more ways how companies can list their stocks on stock exchanges or OTC markets check the video link below. In the video, I will talk about regulation A and how companies can use it in order to get listed on stock exchanges or OTC markets. In addition, I will talk about reverse mergers and how private companies use existing public companies called shell companies to get their company shares traded publicly. Reverse mergers are used by big stock manipulators and it is very common in penny stock niche.

Now I only put 50 bucks in to start because well I have no idea what the hell I am doing. I am curious what to look for in penny stocks I got lucky and had bought MGNA early in the week for like .32 and sold today for .88. Now my next questions is how the hell do I do that again. Is there a good subreddit to help me out or a good one for monitoring stocks throughout the day? Still very new to trading but something I would like to eventually do more of.
