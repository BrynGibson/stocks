* Even if the FDA decision goes your way that's no guarantee the technicals will go your way. That's why so many get caught holding their limp dick and ask ""but...but....they approved it!"" As they see their investment go to zero 

* in fact, because you have no clue whatsoever what will happen when the news comes out (whatever news it may be) you've set all odds against yourself. 

* nearly all of these stocks fail to zero. Treat them like the garbage they are. Make 20%....50%....100% holding no more than a couple of days (NEVER in anticipation of news, earnings, or approval) and move on.
