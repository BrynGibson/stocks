Hi team,

I am following on my previous post on $MRS. The water has just started flowing with merger being completed and contract awards being handed out. **In 1 month, we received 10 million dollars worth of contracts.**

**RECENT NEWS**
http://www.mrscorp.com/mission-ready-announces-additional-unifire-award-of-cad1-3-million/

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/b19r7d/mrs_mission_ready_solutions_follow_up_35/

**What has changed since the previous post?**

Since the previous post, MRS has closed the Unifire acquisition and is on there way to becoming a multi billion dollar company, thanks for their line of credit that they can tap into and the fact that Unifire was one of the 6 companies to be part of the $4 billion in awards from the Defense Logistics Agency. Unifire has a good reputation with the DLA but hasn't had the ability to generate more contract awards due to their limited capital as it takes time and resources to have the supplies on hand in order to service the DLA. With the backing of a public company and its reputational risk, Unifire was able to secure a line of credit that can go up to 100s of millions of dollars. This would help the company have the supply on hand to service the DLA contracts.

**ADS Inc Tactical Loses their Small Business License**

The big fish ADS Inc was caught with defrauding the government and lying about being a small business in 2016-2017. 2 years later, they;ve lost their business license and the good news is that there is a highly unlikely chance they will receive it again. These are some serious allegations that have taken years to develop. With ADS Inc out of the way, who used to take 90% of the billion dollar contracts, it just means that MRS and Unifire have a chance to obtain more than $100million a year in contracts at a minimum.

SEATTLE, May 08, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- SinglePoint (OTCQB:SING) today announces a strategic national distribution program that will provide qualified fast growing CBD product companies a path to get their products into National Retail Distribution.  


The ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program is offered in partnership with a national distribution company that has nearly $2 Billion in annual sales to mass-market stores including CVS, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Giant Eagle, Meijer and Kroger grocery stores in addition to a long list of regional and national convenience stores.

According to SinglePoint President Wil Ralston, ‚ÄúUntil now, startup, established and fast-growing CBD product companies have faced tremendous challenges in growing their business beyond e-commerce and regional distribution due to the enormous capital and logistics involved. We are excited to roll out our ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù marketing program with a major national distributor that is receptive to building a portfolio of fast-growing CBD products and providing those products to their established mass market clients‚Äù.

SinglePoints goal is to seek out and recruit innovative and fast-growing companies that manufacture or distribute CBD retail products, and who desire the opportunity to have their products distributed nationally. SinglePoints ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program is extremely affordable and offers un-paralleled access that can translate into millions of dollars of orders for their respective CBD products.

Ralston added, ‚ÄúAs we have stated, this market in growing exponentially and SinglePoint anticipates that shelf space will become increasingly difficult to obtain as the market matures. To capture this opportunity and firmly position Singlepoint in this unique B2B opportunity the company is acting immediately to screen prospective companies for its ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program and present those companies to our National Distribution Partner for consideration.

‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program partner companies will have added benefits including membership in SingleSource, a cooperative supply chain that allows members to purchase raw materials like CBD Distillate, CBD Isolate, Hemp Flower, and Biomass raw materials simply, and very competitively. ¬†Secondly, members have access to SinglePoints subsidiary SingleSeed which offers access to expanded product lines, manufacturing, custom formulation, and private labeling services.

SinglePoints ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program is available immediately. Principals of companies are encouraged to reach out to [Don@SinglePoint.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KLArMPkamjlj2fuvTgeCNVJk2GN-Aupm4LZhxK-9MBe58gEml0GmjGw2dmuv_WKuug__N4xWSqGU5Yjs4bv27e7GWLMYZjQIBopqvb-e5-Q=) subject line ‚Äú(Company Name) Strategic CBD Distribution‚Äù or call 855-203-3318 for more information. SinglePoint can supply Hemp bi-products including CBD isolate distillate and more to any company in need. To be considered for the ‚ÄúStrategics‚Äù program companies must have annual revenue above $2,000,000. At this time SinglePoint will not disclose our partner due to competition and prescreening process. Approved companies will have the opportunity to present directly to our national distribution partner.",2019-05-08,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bm8t53/sing_singlepoint_introduces_national_distribution/
