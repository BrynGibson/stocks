* We will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

With all that said, it seems dilution has already happened from the $2.5M public offering. It seems it could be a decent product but a CES announcement shouldn't skyrocket the shares up ~80% in 5 days. After all, CES is a registration not invite-only and promotes thousands of companies.",2018-01-05

Similar to what cryptocurrencies use. The reason it's so valuable, it basically negates theft or forgeries. When companies turn blockchain, it's anticipated that there missing profits will turn up, and numbers that have been mismatched for so long will be found in the rubble. Blockchain kind of gives small companies in big companies like the same exact transactional opportunities as what we would think of four Banks, or international trade.

It basically works like this: say you want to transact the dollar to your friend. That dollar represents a AAA, the middleman, whatever Bank you use or whatever, represent AAB, and the final part of that transaction when the dollar gets to your friend is now AAC. At this point, the entire transaction becomes Global, everybody can see how everything happened... that dollar isn't lost, because we know exactly who came from, and where it went to. That's how it negates forgeries and mistakes, block chaining allows us to watch and Trace every step of a transaction process.",2018-01-05
