Do this, but the book called The neatest Little guide to investing in the stock market by Jason Kelly. That should run you about $12. Read and study it.

Then open a paper trading account for just $100-$1000. 

Trade and you‚Äôll realize, you can make money pretty fast. But that‚Äôs without the realization that your trading with your money. 

Now try with a live account for $100. You‚Äôll make impulsive decisions as all traders have. You‚Äôll lose everything to penny stocks. 

Now you read over the book again. And realize all your errors.

Then you‚Äôll have he knowledge not to focus on penny stocks and realize the fastest way to get rich means the slimmest chances of you succeeding. ",2018-07-01

He and his chat room plus alerts have more than paid for themselves. But do not pay for it until you yourself have developed a good understanding of how Kenny Stocks work, and use free resources and like the other commenter said you can also practice paper trading. 

Personally I started reading with real money at the same time I did paper trading. What I did however was whenever I bought a stock with money I also did a paper trade and would do the opposite on paper. 

For example if I sold my shares of real stock, I would hold onto the paper to see what would have happened and to help me not make emotional trades. 

Second thing is this...never trade based on what someone else says, always do your own research and expect to lose your entire investment balance at least a couple times.

Once you feel comfortable, and you can spot potential breakouts and read supports and resistances you can use a guro, again I say Tim Sykes because he does all the trades he talks about and posts it all before market opens and starts with a fresh $5,000 account ever year to prove you don‚Äôt need a huge amount of money To start.  But the best thing for me was having s Chatroom where people would alert things. 

Now I just use reddit mostly ",2018-07-01
