If this continues LVVV could see new highs this week, with gains over 50%.

It means these are great plays and charts that can run for a couple hours at most or provide good dips buys. That being said I have been fairly accurate recently and april has been a good month for OTC. One of the best. AXXA and UHLN would have earned some serious money yesterday and always keep CELZ on the watch. 

AXXA is just a wild one I tried to alert yesterday to everyone. Hope people took some serious profits from it. Up 150% writing this at least. Might get in a minute before close. Thing is wild and hard to ignore the chart. I think we see a mini crash before close though. If nothing else a great morning play. 

IFXY is a much more thinly traded one and not the liquidity of the others but I think it will prove to be a good overnight if you do not chase. Watch the close. 

UHLN is a fun one for sure. Got out near the top in mid day from small overnight position. Huge dip buy earlier and I think it runs in the morning for sure but mid day it could be a dumpster fire. 

BRKK is an interesting one for sure. Medium for liquidity and good chart. Somewhat strong recommendation on this. ",2018-04-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8g1z7a/overnight_plays_for_430_axxa_ifxy_uhln_brkk/

18,For anyone wondering what happened with OMVS,8g2n8h,VPride1995,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8g2n8h/for_anyone_wondering_what_happened_with_omvs/,10,18,"I’ve been following the OMVS story for around a year now, and I tried warning people about it but was ignored. Now the stock is trading at .02-.03. I saw many people arguing it would trade at $1-$5 by this point. 

The merger between OMVS and RAD was likely a scam perpetrated by SR and RAD. Early last year OMVS saw a spike in its stock price. This temporarily saved the company from being diluted into oblivion by convertible bonds. 

Say you have a $1000 bond that is converted at a 50% discount. If your shares are trading at .01 then you must issue 200K shares upon conversion. If your shares trade at .2 you must only issue 10K shares. 

The temporary hype around OMVS saved it from massive dilution. However, that hype wouldn’t last. So OMVS (its CEO and only employee) found a way to extend the hype and protect OMVS from this dilution (and protect his job). A merger with RAD would boost the share price to protect OMVS from dilution.

So what does RAD get from this? Well RAD was and is making no money. The hype from the merger allowed RAD to acquire a shell it could use to sell shares and raise more capital. The hype from the merger essentially is keeping both these entities (now a single entity) afloat. 

This should be obvious. Why would a company with a supposedly bright future (RAD) voluntarily merge with a shell carrying $20M in debt?

I also think most shareholders misunderstand what RAD actually does. RAD is a dealer for SMP Robotics. SMP manufactures and programs these security robots and sells them to RAD. They were listed on the SMP website as a dealer before the merger. This distinction is important when you see people saying “RAD gets XXX in revenue per bot.” Revenue doesn’t matter. Margins matter. The latest Q indicates a margin of ~25%. Without the derivative liabilities and assuming operating expenses remain relatively fixed (with the exception of COGS) OMVS needs to lease ~250+ robots to break even. The last Q indicates 2 are currently leased. 

I predict that the reverse split and name change will be accompanied by continued dilution until this firm eventually declares bankruptcy.",2018-04-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/8g2n8h/for_anyone_wondering_what_happened_with_omvs/
