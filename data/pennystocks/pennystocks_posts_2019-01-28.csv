# TOKERS &amp; JOKERS | CANNABIS STOCKS START THE WEEK STRONG

Posted on [January 28, 2019](https://themorningblunt.com/2019/01/28/tokers-jokers-cannabis-stocks-start-the-week-strong/) by [Amber Wagner](https://themorningblunt.com/author/amberwgnr/)

US and Canadian cannabis stocks were largely on the rise Monday, with only a handful of stocks ending the day in the red.

Last week Ohio-based **Green Growth Brands (OTCMKTS: GGBXF) (CSE: GGB)** initiated a formal hostile takeover offer for **Aphria Inc (NYSE: APHA)**. The deal however, is riddled with unorthodox terms, including an agreement to pay All JS Greenspace LLC ‚Äî a company helping finance the capital-raise to acquire Aphria ‚Äî a commitment fee of $7.5 million if the deal does not go through. Analyst Dmitry Zaytsev revealed last week that Aphria‚Äôs subsidiary GA Opportunities is the largest shareholder in Green Growth Brands, holding a 10% stake. Further, the two companies have had several dealings in the past, leaving some wondering if this is truly a hostile takeover offer.

Green Growth closed down 5.14% on the OTC at $4.05.

Aphria was recently implicated in a class action lawsuit for insider self dealing at the cost of shareholders. A number of the company‚Äôs Latin American assets were allegedly purchased at a significant markup to benefit insiders. The Schall Law Firm encourage investors who purchased Aphria shares between between July 17, 2018 and December 4, 2018 to contact the firm before February 4, 2019.

Aprhia ended the day up 2.93% at $7.37.

Jim Cramer recommended **Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON)** as his second favorite cannabis pick, noting the company‚Äôs recent strategic partnership with Alrtia and its strong management team. Divergent sale prices have resulted in Cronos surpassing Tilray as the most expensive stock, trading at 266x versus Tilray at 155x EV / revenue. Last week CIBC endorsed Cronos as a likely winner in the global cannabis market. Cronos was up a whopping 15.36% at the end of trading at $18.48.

**Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE: CGC)** has a lot going on! In the last three weeks Canopy Growth is up more than 75% reflecting the stream of positive news for the company. The stock is overbought in the near term ‚Äî investors should tread lightly. Last week Piper Jaffray raised the stock‚Äôs target price from $40 to $60 and reiterated their ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating on the company. CIBC also gave the company a bullish endorsement, calling Canopy the cannabis industry‚Äôs best chance at a global titan. The company closed up 4.77% and was trading at $50.77.

**Organigram Holdings Inc. (OTCMKTS: OGRMF) (CVE: OGI)** announced its first quarter financial results for fiscal 2019.

Privateer Holdings ‚Äî currently holding 88% of Tilray‚Äôs outstanding shares ‚Äî recently issued a press release pledging not to sell shares of Tilray. The pledge doesn‚Äôt seem to have lasted long however, with Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy, who serves as the Executive Chairman of Privateer, sold over 149K shares worth $11M of his personal stock. Tilray announced last week that it intends to acquire Natura Naturals Holdings Inc. for CA$35M (about $26.3M) ‚Äî a maneuver that will double the company‚Äôs production capacity. Tilray shares were up 8.73% and trading at $81.93.

Last week **The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd.** **(OTCMKTS: TGODF) (TSE: TGOD)** announced the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved its spin-off of subsidiary TGOD Acquisitions Corp ‚Äî an investment firm focused on the Canadian and international cannabis industry.
