0,Nadex did not work out... What about PennyStocks?,85gepv,Ronan87,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85gepv/nadex_did_not_work_out_what_about_pennystocks/,3,4,"Due to recent health difficulties, I can no longer hold a regular 9-5 job outside of my home.

So i figured a few months ago to work online. Plenty of slave labor work available online, but those won't cover my expenses (which i have minimized as much as realistically possible).

I opt into joining Nadex to trade forex (binaries/spreads) and after doing it for a few months, i feel that particular system isn't working for me (what you make is minuscule compare to how much you can lose). Basically, i am not comfortable in needing 2-4 wins to cover 1 lose. It's almost like gambling... and the odds are horrible. Put in $80 to win $20 sounds great, until you lose and realize you need 4 wins to make up that 1 loss. I fully understand the charts, market trends, etc, but its not *if* but *when* you lose... and it hurts.

I am wondering if PennyStocks are a viable option for someone to start with a few thousand. My goal is simple, make $50-$100 a day, 5 times a week. I'm sure this has been said a million times by a million other people...

Thank you for any information you can provide :)",2018-03-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85gepv/nadex_did_not_work_out_what_about_pennystocks/

3,What's Under The Radar? Low Floaters With No Eyes/Attention?,85fmaw,WonkyWombat321,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85fmaw/whats_under_the_radar_low_floaters_with_no/,20,28,"I'm looking for stocks that are the opposite of what's typically posted here. Stocks knowone is talking about sitting at or close to yearly lows, preferably with outstanding and authorized share counts under 1b, stocks that pop occasionally and trade very thin, preferably with no dilution. For example:

HCEI - 184m float, CEO owns 80% of remaining OS, profitable operations (albeit very low revenue) with no debt, no dilution in years. Upcoming catalyst: working to get current with recent filings, updates anticipated once current/CE has been removed. I like it because in my opinion it's low risk high reward, I don't need to worry about dilution constantly bringing down share price and there's a reason I consider it undervalued (the upcoming catalyst).

Most of what I see posted here is about stocks that have recently seen 3 to 10x gains which is great and all, but jumping in late is a good way to get a quick haircut. I'm always open to discussion, but I personally shy away from pumped stocks and chasing gains.",2018-03-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85fmaw/whats_under_the_radar_low_floaters_with_no/

Sells Stake to Public Accelerator-Incubator to Grow Crowdfunding Portal",85jwhu,louied91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/85jwhu/dati_trucrowd_inc_sells_stake_to_public/,2,0,"https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/DATI/news/truCrowd-Inc-Sells-Stake-to-Public-Accelerator-Incubator-to-Grow-Crowdfunding-Portal?id=186427

CHICAGO, IL, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- truCrowd, Inc., owner and operator of Regulation CF crowdfunding portal truCrowd.com, announced today that the Company has executed an agreement with Digital Arts Media Network, Inc.  (OTCMKTS: DATI), to sell to the Public Accelerator-Incubator (PAI), an equity stake of up to 39.89% percent in the Company, in an effort to grow the SEC registered, FINRA member crowdfunding portal.

Vincent Petrescu, President of truCrowd, Inc., said, “We have strategically aligned the company with DATI in an effort to ramp up the successes we’ve had so far.  We also look to properly take advantage of the surge in those blockchain related projects looking to work within the current framework of the SEC. We believe that by taking responsibility for our own social and cultural output, promoting the appropriate use of Reg. CF portals, we can both support traditional capital formation and Reg CF compliant blockchain related projects.”

DATI is a specialized tech accelerator focused primarily on expediting capital formation by providing angel and early-stage investors access to liquidity, faster.  As part of DATI’s Invest+ program, the Public Accelerator-Incubator has purchased a 19.9% equity stake in truCrowd which will vest over 6 months, with an option to acquire an additional 19.99%.  DATI will also provide capital formation services to the Company through its Angels+ program.  The deal was made with the anticipation (by both managements) that truCrowd, being 1 of only 38 Reg. CF portals  currently registered with FINRA, would be able to better leverage management’s long-standing experience in the crowdfunding space, along with the portal’s current success in meeting client’s/issuer’s capital targets, if a strategic partner could assist with financing, deal flow, business development and execution.

Mr. Petrescu concluded, “We see the StartEngine as an example of what truCrowd can accomplish as a starting point with the right strategic alliances.  With 87,000 registered users and an estimated valuation of $65M dollars, StartEngine has raised roughly $35M for clients, leveraging a combination of Reg. D, Reg. A+ and Reg. CF.  Through our relationship with DATI and the experience its team brings from the public markets, startup community, and venture capital markets, we are confident that we can achieve great success and build truCrowd into a prosperous enterprise.”

It is important to note, the parties to the transaction are requesting comments from truCrowd’s regulatory body prior to consummating the transaction.  Accordingly, the parties may be required to eliminate or modify some of the provisions of the transaction prior to the final closing.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ANDR/news/story?e&amp;id=1033443

BOHEMIA, N.Y., March 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Andrea Electronics Corporation (OTCMKTS:ANDR) (Andrea), the pioneer of digital array microphones and noise reduction software that optimizes the performance of voice driven applications, announced today that its DA-250 array microphone is incorporated into the CIMON virtual assistant robot that will operate as part of the ""Horizons"" project on the International Space Station.

This will be the first form of artificial intelligence (AI) on an ISS mission. CIMON is an experiment overseen by Space Administration at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with Airbus as the prime contractor as well as IBM, Reichert Design and LMU Munich.

The Airbus' CIMON project will also be presented at the IBM THINK convention in Las Vegas on March 19th – 21st 2018.

CIMON (Crew Interactive Mobile CompanioN) is a mobile and autonomous assistance system designed to aid ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst with his everyday tasks on the International Space Station (ISS). Gerst, a 41 year-old German geophysicist, is scheduled to embark on his second research trip to the ISS as part of expedition 56/57 in late April 2018.

""Airbus required a high performance microphone to operate in this unique user environment. They tested other digital array microphones, but nothing solved the complex audio issues like the Andrea DA-250 DSP array microphone with its industrial NR performance and seamless integration for solving the front end far field voice input for CIMON,"" said Douglas Andrea, CEO of Andrea Electronics Corporation.  

Till Eisenberg, project manager at Airbus Friedrichshafen (Germany), eagerly awaits the mission: ""CIMON is a personal assistant capable of voice and facial recognition. We want to study the psychological effects of long space missions on crew members and try out suitable countermeasures, especially those that reduce stress. We will place special emphasis on data mining and interactions between humans and AI.""

CIMON is a hovering spherical device with internal thrusters to propel itself throughout the ISS cabin.
It has a display, speakers and the virtual assistant function is powered by IBM Watson.

https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2018/02/watson-space/

The DA-250 is a small digital signal processing circuit card with stereo microphone sensors.   
The array microphone has state-of-the-art beam forming, noise reduction and acoustic echo cancelation audio input technology and provides robust performance even in noisy server rooms and other fan noise type environments. http://www.andreaelectronics.com/da-250-array-microphone-digital-signal-processor/

An American Innovator
Andrea Electronics sends another first audio system into space.  
Andrea is an American-owned business since 1934. In the 60's the company produced the astronaut audio system for the Project Mercury NASA space program, as well as avionic intercom systems used in F-16 fighter jets and military helicopters. Andrea's microphone array and other advanced digital noise cancellation technologies have been embedded into hundreds of millions of personal computers and other devices. 

The DA-250 Digital Array Microphone line is a standalone advanced microphone solution for OEMs and is among the latest innovations from Andrea Electronics.
