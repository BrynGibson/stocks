To his shock and amazement, when he woke up the next day to check the price, 37,044,500 shares were still trading. The next day 22,471,000 shares traded?! What’s even more perplexing is that Global Links had only issued 1,158,064 shares during its life as a public company, so how did this happen?

LAS VEGAS, June 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc. (OTCPK: ISBG) (“ISBG” or the “Company”), a top-tier brand incubator in the Global Wine &amp; Spirits and CBD-Infused Products markets, is excited to announce the Company’s formation of a strategic partnership with Cannabisfuse.net (“Cannabisfuse”), an emerging leader in the affiliate marketing industry for the cannabis, hemp, and CBD products marketplace.  


“We’re genuinely thrilled to join forces with Cannabisfuse,” commented Terry Williams, ISBG CEO. “There are two powerful dimensions to this opportunity, and we expect both to meaningfully move the needle in terms of the value proposition for ISBG shareholders. First, we will be a feature brand for all those who flow through the Cannabisfuse.net site for products, services, and news related to cannabis, hemp, and CBD. Second, the deal opens up powerful opportunities in the $6.8 billion affiliate marketing space, granting us access to a number of powerhouse market players.”

Management notes that ISBG P19 CBD products will be the featured brand on the Cannabisfuse.net site on a weekly basis, as well as a feature in their outreach materials. The Company anticipates a noticeable positive impact on ISBG sales growth given the meaningful expansion of its distribution footprint through the partnership arrangement.

In addition, ISBG sees strong potential in the affiliate marketing space, and the partnership with Cannabisfuse will grant official affiliation with Howtogrowweed420.com, Grasscity.com, Amazon.com, and DiscoverCBD.com.

“Most people aren’t aware that 15% of total digital media advertising revenue is attributed to affiliate marketing,” continued Mr. Williams. “By combining access to powerful opportunities in the affiliate marketing space and dramatically increasing product visibility for our core Health and Wellness line, the Cannabisfuse partnership offers us a fast path to expanding revenues both laterally and vertically, and we look forward to working with the Cannabisfuse team and powerfully exploiting both of those exciting opportunities in the months and quarters ahead.”",2019-06-06,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/bxjjbk/isbg_partners_with_cannabisfusenet_to_enter_68b/
