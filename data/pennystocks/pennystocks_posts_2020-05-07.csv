4,HQGE - One of those stocks you put like $20 into and then in a year have like 1K?,gf35z8,Username_Checks-Out-,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf35z8/hqge_one_of_those_stocks_you_put_like_20_into_and/,1,0,"Los Angeles, CA, May 05, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -- HQ Global Education, Inc. (OTC: HQGE) announced today that that its wholly owned subsidiary Big M Entertainment Pictures(BMEP) is ready to begin production on its full-length feature film,\*CAPTURED,\*in early June, and that they are confident that they will be able to complete the projectwhile adhering to all necessary guidance and requirements pertaining to the current COVID pandemic.

Marvin Williams, President of BMEP and one the films producers, commented, As they say in Hollywood,*The show must go on*, and BMEP is dedicated to stepping up to the challenge of delivering an edge of your seat hair raising supernatural horror film with minimum crew levels and maximum production value.

Mr. Williams added, What makes this moment unique from a filmmaking perspective is a uniquely crafted production workflow where we have minimized the number of crew members needed to execute the filming while still delivering a unique visual experience for a demanding audience. We also remain committed an aggressive post-production schedule including delivery of the completed film in Q4 of 2020.

*CAPTURED*is an independent supernatural horror film and psychological thriller that takes place on the heels of a crippling pandemic. The film is centered on a couple who set out on a vacation getaway and just as they arrive at their destination they learn that the safer at home order has been reinstated and the quarantine will be back in effect within 24 hours. The disgruntled couple reluctantly decide to return home, but before doing so they stop to pick up a keepsake which later unleashes a horrific force inside their home, leaving them trapped inside while also facing the anxiety of the ongoing pandemic.

The films creators have built upon elements of earlier successful releases, includingthe minimal casting arrangements seen in films like Paranormal Activity, which grossed over $193M at the U.S. box office, and the gritty, realistic styling of The Blair Witch Project, which grossed over $248M at the U.S. box office.

The irony of the horror film genre is its remarkable ability to consistently rank among the most profitablegenres without relying on high priced A-List actors, which it does by introducing a steady stream of outstanding up and coming young talent.*CAPTURED*continues this tradition by featuringrising newcomer Jamie Ohlsen, who has appeared in seven features in preparation for what by all appearances figures to be his first breakout role. As an added bonus, and perhaps a box office kicker, the film has also been written to include a surprise star cameo role, the details of which are in final negotiations and currently being kept secret.

The film concept developed by BMEP and demonstrated in*CAPTURED*provides one of the cornerstones of the companys signature offerings and has already been received enthusiastically by the same distribution companies that are now in negotiations with BMEP regardingtwo of BMEPs documentaries,*TREES*and\*DISTANCE,\*both of which are currently in pre-production. Additional information on those films will be forthcoming soon.

16,NLS - Swing Oppurtunity,gf1pp5,TheBazaarTrades,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf1pp5/nls_swing_oppurtunity/,1,4,"Tonight's a tough one. Too many inconsistencies and plenty of unattractive parabolics I didn't like; Despite looking head to toe around the market, I had to stretch the window price scan wider than normal that I'm used to. Overall, something did come up. A very unique sure thing bullish chart of NLS. While my posts are uniquely focused on searching **before the move,** something occurred to me reviewing each ticker that's throwing me off... Dead slow-moving stocks that suddenly explode based on catalyst news much like GNUS, MGNX, &amp; XRF. These are impossible to catch **before the move**, and more or less wasn't picked up from an overnight activity yesterday (maybe subtle, I don't know). I probably will be doing some tweaking &amp; testing to sharpen my searches and overviews.

Anyways... TLDR let's get down to business. 

NLS appears to be having some overnight pullback activity today. More activity was pushed for a swing opportunity noticed under the bid order history. Something a little baffling to me though is one or two things might be played out here: 

Either a perfect entry-level at $5.00 or a better patient entry-level at $4.1 (if supposedly it pulls back more). Look at all three charts... what do they all have in common? They seem to be following the same pattern of stair climbing at the 50EMA (the peach-colored line).

In short, this is a strong bullish momentum chart if you look at all three of the daily charts. You can either test the entry at overall: $4.2, $4.1, &amp; if you're brave it's current lv $5.15 (which I don't recommend).

38,[Tinfoil hat time] The MVIS Rumor is true,gexi90,AngelaTheRipper,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gexi90/tinfoil_hat_time_the_mvis_rumor_is_true/,1,208,"To open I will make a bold claim, the rumors are true. Why do I think so, because that’s a pre-requirement for what follows to make sense. You can call me insane, idgaf. 

Someone knows the above and has orchestrated a massive scheme to profit on this fact. We’ll call them whales. 

Whales started the buyout rumor in order to get the volume up. Nobody knows where this rumor started, MSFT using MVIS technology in their shit has been public knowledge for years. Probably pumped the stock a bit themselves, FOMO in full effect, then pumped it some more in extended hours using the fact that the volume is low, most stocks don’t move much in extended hours mind you. If you look at the past few days majority of gains happened during extended hours. Let it run for a few days to further build up the volume. Pump again during extended hours, keep that FOMO going. This was Friday and Monday.

Then came yesterday (Tuesday), normal start although the momentum started to fizzle down. Then came the stop raid. Why, a few reasons, get some cheap stocks, shake off a chunk of the weaker hands, get an estimate of how much you can really crash it, trigger an SSR breaker, and lower the confidence into the stock which in turn lowers the volume. Then just let it recover or pump it up a bit, you need less volume but you still need a lot of volume to pull this shit off.

This brings us into today (Wednesday), not much growth since yesterday, the momentum fizzled out but those who were holding were holding hoping to sell during late Wednesday or early Thursday or push their luck and sell before the call, few planned to actually brave the earnings report and conference call. None of us believed the rumor to be true. 

Then came the massive dip, courtesy of a fake news headline, bots/trolls spreading it around, and probably some good old fashioned market manipulation. 

This brings us to accumulation. The chart behaved weird, frequently just trading in a 2 cent range for hours, like there were points where it broke out in either direction but it basically stayed in 1.08 to 1.10 range for a large chunk of the trading session. This brings us to the SSR breaker, once that’s tripped for the rest of the trading day and the next day you can only place a short sale order at a higher price than the current price. So shorts had to play ball and sell for 1.10 or 1.09 when the price was at 1.08. A dip like that attracted a lot of shorts looking for a quick buck. The whales have eaten up all the short sales coming in and the weak hands getting out and are holding millions of shares. There was no recovery in the after hours today. Why, cause they don’t need it. The minor spike in AH was probably some dumber shorts getting burned and having to cover.

Tomorrow (Thursday) the trading day is going to be a sideways slide with close to 0 net change, it’s gonna look like the tail end of a one day runner after its done spiking, whoever was going to panic sell panic sold already.

ATHX
Athersys, Inc.

Athersys is devloping a unique ""MultiStem"" stem cell therapy treatment for ARDS, or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome caused by COVID-19. [It recently began enrollment for phases 2/3.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/athersys-announces-commencement-patient-enrollment-100000830.html)

It was 4.3 just at the beginning of April. Earnings are tomorrow AH. Chart looks primed for a pump. I plan to buy in the morning and sell towards close.

48,“Pattern Day Trader” Lessons Learned,gewiue,Slow_is_Fast,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gewiue/pattern_day_trader_lessons_learned/,1,37,"So I’ve seen this pop up several times lately and I’d like to give some answers from personal experience. 

So what is a pattern day trader (PDT)?
Anyone who makes 3+ trades in any “rolling” five market days. 
Example: On a Monday, I buy 100 shares of ABC stock in premarket, and during market hours, I buy another 100 shares. After the bell, on the same day, in post market trading, I sell all shares. 
This is where some people get caught, since it’s TWO lots, and you sell both at end of the day, that is TWO day trades. 
Now the next day, Tuesday, I buy shares in DEF stock. And, I sell them this same day. 
That’s day trade number THREE. 
Since I committed two day trades on Monday, those will be gone the following Monday. Then on the next day, Tuesday, the third falls off. 
Here’s a caveat, let’s say one of the days in this 5 day market stretch is a federal holiday. Then instead of the day trades falling off on Monday and then Tuesday, it would then be Tuesday and Wednesday. 

What happens if within these 5 days you make a fourth day trade?
You are flagged as a PDT. 
If you’re account does not have $25k total balance (cash, securities, equity), your account will incur an “equity call” where you’ll need to fund your account to the aforementioned $25k total balance. 

What happens if you don’t fund your account? 
Your account will be restricted to cash only. Which means that your transactions will need to settle before you have cash to buy other shares. 
This restriction is lifted if, and when, your balance is over $25k. 

The account requirement of $25k must be maintained at all times or an equity call is triggered. 

Here are fun facts.. I learned all this the hard way. I got flagged as a PDT. Obviously this is an issue. 
I sent a message to my trading platform, E*TRADE, requesting that I change my account from margin to cash. I didn’t want this issue and thought that this would remove the flag of “pattern day trader”. 
It wouldn’t. 
However, my advisor offered a “silver bullet” in that if I requested to reset the counter, eliminate the PDT flag while staying a margin account, then all would be well and I could trade again without an equity call. And the warnings and flag goes away. 

Caveat: I break the PDT rules again, I’m stuck with it forever. No exceptions and I have to meet the equity call. 

So, I’ve used my silver bullet, but learned exactly what I can get away with. And what I can’t. Hopefully whoever reads this learns something from my experience.   

Ask away any questions..",2020-05-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gewiue/pattern_day_trader_lessons_learned/

Split Market -NAZ Up, DOW Down
 
Earnings Galore
 
 
Today’s market was a split affair from right after the open.  While the NASDAQ was higher, the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were sloppy at best.  While the NASDAQ has regained its entire loss for 2020 (not the highs, but since 1/2/2020), the DJIA is still -5054 or 17.5% and the S&amp;P 500 is -392 or 12%. At the highs today the DJIA was +171 and finished on the lows -218.45 (.91%), NASDAQ +45.27 (.51%), S&amp;P 500 -20.02 (.70%), the Russell -10.50 (.82%) and the DJ Transports -115.47 (1.43%).
Market internals were weak with NYSE 2:1 down and NASDAQ 1.5:1 down.  Volume was also light.  On the DJIA we were decidedly down with 23 lower, 6 higher and PFE unchanged.  The gainers were AAPL +21 and MSFT +12 DPs while on the downside we had UNH -29 and BA &amp; TRV -24 DPs.  Sectors on the upside included Info tech and consumer discretionary while Financial, Utilities and Energy the weak groups.
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 1900 members.

SECTORS: Earnings played a part in today’s market again.  PTON was higher by 1.81 before the numbers and after the beat the stock traded as high as $42.40 and settled $41.76 + 3.73.  WYNN missed top and bottom lines with the slower than expected attendance in Macau and the stock, already down from a recovery high of $152 to close the day $79.25 -.42 fell to $76.50 before a $77.40 close -1.85.
ETSY was also a disappointment after closing at a new all-time high at $78.24 +5.45 (7.49%) and after hitting $84.01 fell back to $69.11 and finished $74.05 – 4.19.  
 
But the award for the day goes to the analysts who both downgraded Macro-Genics (MGNX) and lowered their price objectives to $13 from $17 (Credit Suisse) and $15 from $16 at SVB Leerink, only to have the stock report and then be halted for volatility several times on its way from last nights close of $7.60 to $27.34 and closed $25.15 +17.55 (230.92%)…GOOD CALL…Got your resume up to date??

BITCOIN: closed $9340 +355. After breaking out over $7500 we have consolidated and broken over 8,000 and 8,500 and again consolidated.

Fortunately, I only lost $100. Unfortunately, i lost more than that. I lost my dignity and sense of reasoning.

If a stock has already gone up over 100% then you’re too late. Sure some of them continue to go up but it’s not a very good risk to take. You risk losing way more than if you were to buy it on the way up or before the pump. I know with this one it was a direct offering. Still just wanted to remind everyone to be careful. There will always be new opportunities every single day. Be patient!,2020-05-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf6xi8/dont_buy_after_the_explosion/

Don’t look at mvis as a loss... look at it like you are getting an extraordinary deal on the next Microsoft... that’s why these big holders like vanguard are buying. 

This may be one of the investments I make where it went from a speculative short term buy into a long haul hold. 

Their products are revolutionary and it makes logical sense they will be industry leaders, if not major contributor. Even with UAVS we can laugh at how small and weird that pump and dump was... but drone controlled farming is an inevitable progression for agriculture. So why not get first in line!

I received 5 awards. I know it has only been about 12 hours since I last posted, considering the fast moving nature of the market, I decided to post this right before NASDAQ open. 

I won't have time to implement new ideas and suggestions until weekend, so the same thing will be manually posted on Friday. 

I will also set the script to monitor more subreddits. I am thinking of cross-referencing trade volumes and prices using Google finances. Any ideas and suggestions are welcome. I don't promise to implement your ideas and suggestions, it all depends on my time availability and the task difficulty. 

Next week I will probably start AUTOMATICALLY posting it in my own subreddit or something.  The reason for posting in my own subreddit is because I think it might be useful for people to look at historic data. Not having other threads cluttering things up might be helpful. I will be monitoring more than 1 subreddit. I will also be looking for moderator for my new subreddits, as I am not good with technology, so I need help. I am not making any promise at this stage yet, I am just gathering potential help that I need down the line. 

I don't know if my bot would be welcomed here. Mod, if you want my future bot to post here, please make a mod comment. 

Anyways, the next update will be around 8/May 1400 BST. Your OP is living in England, this is why I use BST. The reason I post around 1400 BST is because my stocks are in NASDAQ. (Damn you, NASDAQ: MVIS)  

Finally, please don't use this free service as an investment advice - the whole thing is pretty stupid.

I’m open to suggestions but what I have in mind is 2 different types of flairs. I prefer the second type

First type: the flair would say how many pennystocks they’ve accurately called out before the spikes. For example, if someone called out IZEA and MVIS before their spikes then they’d have a ‘2’ flair next to their name 

Second type: the flair would say how experienced / reputable the user is. For example, everyone starts off with either none or a ‘beginner’ or ‘noob’ flair. Then after 5 accurate call outs they get upgraded to ‘intermediate’. Then after 10 call outs they get upgraded to ‘advanced’. Then after 20 call outs they get upgraded to ‘expert’. Again, these are just suggestions and I expect you guys to make changes to these.

The reasoning behind this is to help this sub somewhat differentiate between credible posts and posts we should be weary of. A lot of us, me included, are beginners. We don’t know how to find penny stocks before they blow up and we usually just hop on the train midway through. There’s dozens of different stocks posted daily and it’ll help narrow down credible ones quicker (where we’ll then do our own DD). We also don’t know who’s advice to take when we have 20 different people saying 20 different things. If I have 3 ‘advanced’ people telling me to dump a stock and 10 ‘noob’ people telling me to hold, Id likely be more inclined to dump.

The only downside that I can think of is that an advanced / expert user could try and abuse that status to pump a stock just to save themselves.


There’s more to it but I’m on mobile right now so typing all this out sucks. Hopefully you all catch my drift though. Thoughts?",2020-05-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf5p62/should_new_user_flairs_be_added/

NEW YORK, NY -- May 6, 2020 -- InvestorsHub NewsWire -- Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCQB:SGMD) (""Sugarmade"", ""SGMD"", or the ""Company""), today announces the receipt of over $10 million in new orders for consumable sanitary supplies and non-medical personal protective items, as America prepares to get back to work. Businesses across the country that are preparing to reopen face both the moral and legal obligations to protect their workers and customers. Many are scrambling for supplies as part of this re-opening process. Sugarmade's CarryOutsupplies.com operating unit is benefiting via receiving purchase orders in excess of $10 million. 



""We have never seen anything like this situation. We believe we are in a unique situation relative to the re-opening of America,"" commented Jimmy Chan, CEO of Sugarmade. ""Approximately two months ago we began importing consumable sanitary supplies and non-medical personal protective gear. As it turns out, this was a wise move. We sold out of nearly all of what we received. Fortunately, we have the sourcing and trans-Pacific logistical experience to bring in much larger quantities to help meet the insatiable demand that is developing as business, universities, and government institutions order supplies to protect their workers and customers. We have a lot more product in the supply chain that will soon be headed to our customers."" 



Over the past 15 years of operations Sugarmade has gained considerable experience relative to sourcing paper and consumable products from Asian factories and importing these products into the United States. The Company has drawn on these experiences and industry contacts to identify multiple factory sources that indicate a willingness to supply millions of dollars of products to Sugarmade. By way of this experience, the Company believes it will be able to facilitate the movement of the huge amounts of supplies that companies and government entities are now demanding as they begin to execute plans to re-start operations. 



Mr. Chan continued, ""America is getting back to work and we are here to help with many of the supplies businesses and other institutions are demanding. We are quickly expanding our sourcing and importing efforts to help U.S. businesses and other institutions protect their employee and provide safe working environments. While the gating factor in filling these orders, over the short term, will be the availability of air freight, we also believe we are well position relative to the longer-term as our considerable experience in trans-Pacific logistics is brought to bear."" 



Investors, the public, and other interested parties are advised to reference the Company's recent filing with the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission on Form 8-K concerning these events and to reference other disclosures and risk factors outlined in other filings put forth by the Company, which are available on the Commission's website and via other resources.

Their new drug should bring in at least 20 million, and giving their market cap of 28 million this should really boost the company long term.

234,Question on gap trading strategy,gf9dx6,Jmorrrrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf9dx6/question_on_gap_trading_strategy/,3,1,"Late last night I did some DD on GNUS since so many are talking about it and thought it could be a good buy but not at the AH levels it was trading at yesterday. 

I’ve noticed a lot of people seem to set limits before the market closes on the day before, so I thought, “well if these people want to sell at a lower level I’m willing to buy from them.” So I set a buy limit at 0.60, which was a whole number around yesterday’s high levels, a likely place someone would have set a sell limit.

I figured my order wouldn’t get filled but it was worth a shot. I woke up this morning and lo and behold my order was filled and I was making an instant 30-50%!

Since UAVS, and following closely MVIS, this sub has become a huge circle jerk of ""THIS STOCK ABOUT TO RUN, GET READY TO P&amp;D!""

While P&amp;D is viable, and most certainly a good way to make a few bucks, it's not always the only option. There are infact good Pennystocks out here that have a real shot of outgrowing their P&amp;D value.  

It seems like no one is doing DD, and everyone is just buying rumors.  

IZEA is one of the companies that has a real shot here, and by no means the only one.  They have partnered with twitch.  Yeah, freakin AMAZON'S TWITCH.  Soon, they'll have their ER and PR for their new BrandGraph which, if successful will definitely launch them with more big name corporations looking to maximize their ad revenue in our new age of Covid-19.  

The outlook on Covid-19 is that it isn't going away any time soon.  There have been reports saying that social distancing and more could be around until 2022.  People will be working from home, staying home more often, using the internet more, spending more time on social media to get their social fix, and right there with them, whether they know it or not will be IZEA marketing to them all the things they want.  Along with that, will be big name corporations who need to  make money somehow.  

So, yes, while IZEA may have rocketed yesterday and fallen down to .60's, it's still up .20+ from 2 days ago.  It's going to grow because they offer a valuable service that companies will find themselves needing.",2020-05-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf92p7/why_youre_wrong_about_izea/

It’s a junior gold mine company that has a huge upside potential and has been reviewed recently by many analysts as buy and hold long. It’s extremely undervalued and has been steadily climbing at 3-5-15% daily.   I found this stock because I’m a big fan of business man Stan Bhartti. He has an amazing  track record of turning publicly traded companies into gold (pun intended). He now runs a Fortune 500 styled company (Forbes and Manhattan) out of Toronto and ESM is one of his chosen companies to invest in and take to its full potential. 
The increase in gold and market volatility from covid make buying gold and gold mining stocks a smart investment. I’m excited about this one and I’m in no way saying that you should run out and buy this stock. Maybe do some DD though and maybe you’ll like what you see about this company.   There’s no rocket ships in this post or “to the moon and back”. This stock is a sound investment that will make you money in the short term and the long term.

I know some of you have had a shitty day and been involved in some of the stocks I'm about to mention. 

Alright, let's start.. I feel like the past few weeks there's been a lot of....attachment to stocks. Particularly ones that have gone tits up. DECN, UAVS and today MVIS are all prime examples of this but there have been others that didn't have the traction that these got since they were pump and dumps. I've read countless times ""I believe in this stock"" when its going nowhere any time soon. What's odd about this is the fact that a lot of advice that I've seen on here involves *separating your emotions* from trading. It's passed around quite a bit as advice for managing losses and reducing the risk of losses and its a legitimate thing. 

One emotion that I think some of you are overlooking is hope. You see your stock tank due to bad news, or a bad report, or even a whale dropping 700k stocks at once and instead of mitigation your losses and walking away while you can, you try to justify it. You think to yourself ""oh, it'll bounce back"" or ""PR is coming in two days maybe it will shoot back up"". In some cases I'm sure that happened, MVIS *did* indeed climb back up a little bit before the CC today. But then people held on still. The same with UAVS last week. The stock tanked during the stockholders call and instead of selling off a lot of people held on and are still holding on. I see a UAVS post at least once a day talking about news. The same with DECN. 

You can't be hopeful about a stock. You're buying stock to make money. Not support the company and be its cheerleader. If that stock starts to lose value, especially at a fast rate *ditch it and move on*. There are thousands of stocks. Literally every day there are 3 or 4 that are primed to make good size gains. At least once a week lately there has been a new pump and dump. Move on. Look for the next stock. Don't be one of these people waiting for a stock to rise after a hard crash. Sell your stock and reinvest that money into something worthwhile instead of letting it sit there doing nothing for you because you lost a third or half or three quarters of your investment. GO MAKE THAT SHIT BACK! 

I hope this has been helpful for someone, or can start some conversation that will be helpful. We're all here to make money, and we need to help each other when we can.

I'll make this quick and start off by saying I'm a rookie with regard to the stock market but have done my fair share of research into smaller / ""off the radar"" companies poised with interesting opportunities and lucrative potential.

I was first introduced to NEXCF right before their big blastoff breakout, 52-week high price after news of their launch of 3D augmented reality (3D/AR) solution for online eCommerce product placement advertising.

The CEO of the company seems to have always been, most especially in recent weeks, an active member of the shareholder community and stands behind his brand. There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right?  He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action!  I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of NEXCF.

Not to mention, although NEXCF is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.

Yesterday I had set up a stop order for a stock when it dropped to .85 cents, however when I woke up a little after the market had opened, I saw that it sold at .70 cents. I was wondering how that happened or if I did something wrong in setting it up? For example, should I use a stop limit order instead or is that unavoidable because it only accounts for market price and not pre-market price?

Another question I had has to do with stocks like MVIS. I, like a lot of you, jumped on the train too late and got burned. I've been reading a lot of here about dumping your stocks at power hour, but I was curious about how you differentiate between which stocks to dump. For example, I currently own shares in RMBL and MARK and I want to see how they play out, but at the moment they are losing value as I bought in too high. Is that a situation where I should wait for it to go up a little and dump, or should I try and stick with it to see how it works out over the next week?

Hey everyone!

Just wanted to share with you some tips and tricks on penny stocks. Penny Stocks are very easily manipulated! The best strategy to play them and get out green is to Buy the Rumors - Sell the News!

If actual (factual) news come out, the buy when the news come out and sell the next day. Penny stocks are small cap companies that need to raise cash to operate. What they usually do is pump the price to cash out like in $UAVS or $MVIS. Or if they actually have good news, they pump the price and send an offering to, also, cash out. Either way, they dont care about short term/day trading investors. The best thing we can do is follow the aforementioned rule - Buy the Rumor, Sell the news. Now back to the business!

I have profited 102.37% off UAVS. 223.65%+ off MVIS. Today in the AH I got into ZOM and I am already 12.61% up. What happened to ZOM? ZOM did not actually release any news today. What happened is that QRVO ($12B cap company) has been partnering with ZOM ($30M cap company) to work on a veterinary point-of-care diagnostic platform( [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-point-care-diagnostic-platform-203010444.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-point-care-diagnostic-platform-203010444.html?.tsrc=rss) ). What they have been working on is not important though. What is important is:

1. QRVO is 400x bigger company than ZOM and they have been partnering
2. QRVO mentioned ZOM's name in their ER (Imagine what would happen to MVIS is MSFT mentioned them in their conference? I know MVIS would have been thru the roof)
3. Key development milestone has been achieved

So why is ZOM still not thru the roof? QRVO announced the news today during their Earnings report for themselves. The news about ZOM has not reached the public yet. Those who heard the good news, already bought in. Those who haven't heard, are going to buy in right after they read this post. Let's all get in and wake up to $0.50 opening on ZOM.

Be cautious though. Take profits when you reached your profit goal and do not be greedy. We don't want to fall into a trap with an offering like a lot of people did with GNUS.

Good luck to all!

They tabled the meeting because they didn’t have a quorum...that’s a little different from “merger approved!”...however, they did say that 95% of shareholders that have voted approved it.

Quoted from the 8-K filed today -

Adjournment of Special Meeting
On May 7, 2020, Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the “Company” or “Conatus”) convened and adjourned a special meeting of stockholders because a quorum was not present to conduct business at the special meeting. The special meeting will be reconvened on May 21, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, virtually and stockholders can register to attend the special meeting by visiting, www.proxydocs.com/CNAT by no later than May 19, 2020 at 2:00 p.m., Pacific Time. The record date for the special meeting remains March 13, 2020.


Looks like a couple more weeks of holding within this range...upper resistance at .50ish, so it’ll probably oscillate up and down between now &amp; then.  I’m holding shares at .45, and hopefully we’ll see it pop when the vote does go through.

Today, we saw a lot less spam in the sub. Seems like we’re reloading as the trading week comes to an end. Expect to see more new names on Monday. 

**$MVIS** will have it’s final judgement in a half hour from posting. I pray you crazy bastards get something or get out fast enough.  Otherwise, **$GNUS** riders, you guys must have made the easiest money of your life. Everybody gets one. Be careful.


**DDs YOU SHOULD READ**

Here are the best DDs that I noticed today…

[**$NAKD by u/TheBazaarTrades:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf1zom/nakd_so_dirty_so_hard_to_look_away/) Interesting read here. Immediate jump after it was posted and a slow comedown to end at $.65. Is God personally investing in everything u/TheBazaarTrades mentions?

[**$NNDM by u/DragonElder:**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/gf7129/nndm_nano_dimensions/) Not too much to read here, but the hype train has not arrived to the station just yet. Worth a look.


**WHAT I WAS WRONG/RIGHT ABOUT YESTERDAY**

Since I am the most dedicated u/TheBazaarTrades stan, I took a position in **$NAKD**. I also put more shares into **$UMRX** which is my horse. Little less than 6% rise today on that one. **$DFFN** had a nice 15% jump. Finally, I put more into **$BIOC**. EARNINGS NEXT WEEK BABY!! WHOO

**$SXTC** declined 5%, but I maintain faith.



**THE NEW CLASS**

**$SGLB** - US mask manufacturer and the US government is now rejecting Chinese masks. Could they fill the void?

**$REED** - Seems like the baseline on this ticker is moving up to $.70. [Worth keeping an eye on as an institution increased ownership stake.]( http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/13D/summary2/?id=7837599)

**$SHIP:** So I jumped out of this big time the other day, and of course it rose up to .14. Please be careful with this one but will be worth watching. Heavily manipulation so needs to be monitored.

**$ZOM:** 35% jump is nothing to sneeze at. This is probably the most volatile stock of everything written about today. Not sure if you can still hop on the train.


And that’s it for today. I hope some of this info is useful, or at least entertaining to read. Support your local DD-ers here on r/pennystocks and as always…

Last week I bought 500 shares of CPE at .81 and sold 400 shares at .89 so I chalked it up as a win. Now it’s sitting around .77 and I still have 100 shares.
