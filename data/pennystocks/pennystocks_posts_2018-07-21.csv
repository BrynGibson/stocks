0,Monday picks and adds BIOAQ EMPM AAPH SGTN BLUU,90nofk,Budd0413,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/90nofk/monday_picks_and_adds_bioaq_empm_aaph_sgtn_bluu/,8,9,"The number one for this week is for sure (thanks to quantum) 

$BIOAQ. The info is all available but basically the company is being bought out as part of the Q proceedings, 7 bidders have signed and submitted sealed bids for entire plant and all IP,  big big companies submitting bids here this is one of the best plays this year no doubt.   Started my position .0486 Wednesday I’ve been watching it since the guys on the discord called it out and that was .015. Wish I did my dd then.  

$EMPM. Small float getting locked up, clean entity and trading textbook ,  def adding anything I can Monday morning 

$SGTN. Another small float solid business , trades super thin, excellent management with a good plan that is being executed, being scooped up by some strong hands 

Those are the three most important adds for me this Monday and all week 

Still waiting on $AAPH I think news this week regarding the William Alessi custodianship/takeover , in the .002’s seems like a great spot to add 

$BLUU same team Alessi waiting on this one too still in trips if it gets granted (which looks highly Likely as company did not contest and has no legal council) this will be on the .002 for first big leg then gonna follow all the Alessi plays think LDSR. 

 Hope y’all find one here you like, dd is out there,  just plays I have seen on Twitter/chat rooms that upon further dd I felt comfortable buying ",2018-07-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/90nofk/monday_picks_and_adds_bioaq_empm_aaph_sgtn_bluu/

Sometimes it bugs out and says the price drops 90%. The scanners don't work so it's tough to find intraday movers.

Does anyone have free video libraries or things to read? Especially for low float traders.",2018-07-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/90qo5d/favorite_way_to_study_on_weekends/

4,Antibe Therapeutics,90t4dw,DesignPrime,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/90t4dw/antibe_therapeutics/,22,19,"I tried to dig through this company, through the circular on page 19 : 

http://www.antibethera.com/wordpress/pdf/agm/2018%20AGM%20Notice%20and%20Information%20Circular%2015May2018.pdf

Is the right most column the number of shares each director holds or once had? Kind of confused about that.

I am more inclined to think management does not having any skin in the game as far as ownership when I tried to dig through google and Filings. Curious anyone thoughts on this?
