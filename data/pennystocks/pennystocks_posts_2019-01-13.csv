4,Weekly microcap stocks recap $FLKS $AXSM $PHUN $FTK $SAEX,afm76a,vytasmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/afm76a/weekly_microcap_stocks_recap_flks_axsm_phun_ftk/,1,6,"The first month of this year trading is already halfway through.

&amp;#x200B;

We got some more action while general stock market indices are picking up after big selloff at the end of the 2018. Will see if this is only a corrective move or the beginning of the price increase after the dip.

&amp;#x200B;

The video recap is available here: [https://youtu.be/PdiB-T-u-RY](https://youtu.be/PdiB-T-u-RY) . Recap video is longer one but I went into details about particular stocks, but here is a quick review for stocks that been reviewed in this week's video recap.

&amp;#x200B;

Most interesting stocks we will look at are:

&amp;#x200B;

$FLKS actually was the previous week's Friday play, but entered this week with the red price. Price dropped on Monday. News provided by the company on Jan4 were typical nonfactual and more PR purpose like to increase stock price, this is why this stock was only speculative play nothing more. Big volume always attacks more traders and this is why this stock was on the radar and noticeable in the market. But volume didn't pick up at the end on Friday's trading, so the price was doomed combined with nonfactual news. In the video, I explain the details about how to understand if the news is worth something or not.

&amp;#x200B;

$AXSM was the stock that used same PR stunts but as well after the end of Monday's trading day informed with the news that told a lot about possible future price trend and the general situation in what is happening. So the company started with announcing a positive trial of depression drug. The stock surged massively &gt;100%. After the trading day, $AXSM dropped the news that they use ATM facility and are now selling 23.3 million worth of stock straight into the market to get proceeds for their business operations. So this is price increase most likely was orchestrated so public first would start buying stock so they could sell their shares through ATM facility. In simple words: positive news were released and stock jumped up, stay up while selling is happening and then, of course, I only predict but the stock price should slide down because of this selling till they come up with the new news to feed the masses.

&amp;#x200B;

$PHUN the stock that increased on air. Huge volatility and ultra-low volume. I saw some social media traders talked that they traded this stock and I am very very cautious if this is true because there were no news, no shortable shares, no volume, no nothing, only price increase. So without previous information beforehand trading this stock is impossible, especially with any real volume to put into the trade. Nevertheless, a massive surge in stock is fun to watch:)

&amp;#x200B;

$FTK jumped on Friday and this was the stock with legit news and I took this stock to review because to make a comparison with $FLKS and how legit news differs from forward-looking statement companies like to spread for PR purposes to manipulate the stock price. More info in the video while it was easier for me to put down the information and explain the details.

&amp;#x200B;

$SAEX is very technical play. No news associated with a price increase at the end of the Friday's trading. The stock actually increased and consolidated during the week and popped more at the end of the week. General short term price trend is up. More fundamental analysis is needed while most of the time news are needed for the stock price to move and it will be interesting to see if we have any important news coming up while if there will be interesting news it is very possbile this week's trading was done by bigger market players to accumulate positions in the stock. But will see and I myself need to look more into company's fundamentals. Keeping this stock in the watchlist for the next week.

&amp;#x200B;

Here it is for this week. GL trading guys!
