I just visited this subreddit thinking I hadn't been here in months and this is the first post I see. Congrats on the leadership position. Sounds like some great plans forthcoming. 

Speaking of which, this is penny stocks so what's the largest cap y'all talk about around here? If the community is so inclined, I can write up a DD post within a few weeks on a stock currently trading under $4/share, with a market cap of ~290M. I own a decent chunk (not trading it), but I'm amenable to others trying to poke holes in it if this meets your criteria.",2019-10-22

I may be wrong here....
Example, 

You bought 50 shares of stock ABC at $10/share

Then you bought another 50 shares of ABC at $9/share at a later date 

Today you sold 50 shares of stock ABC at $15/share. The 59 shares being sold are the ones you bought first, they are now going out first, hence the term first in first out.
