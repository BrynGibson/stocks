73,rivers61,eca5hei,/r/pennystocks/comments/a8c8sk/gthp/eca5hei/,1,"I've been doing some research on this over the past few hours, mind you I am an investing novice.  But their product LuViva looks amazing and as far as Im aware that is the key to growth.  I have gone through multiple sources and so far what I have gathered about LuViva is that it is a future replacement for the current methods of cervical cancer testing (the main one being Pap smears).  

LuViva is both a scanner which uses a patented ""biophotonic"" thing to see differences in cell tissues; and a single use kit that I do not know how it works but apparently has an 80% profit margin so who cares from an investing stand-point.  LuViva has tested with 100% accuracy in diagnosing cervical cancer, and can detect it earlier than current methods.  The scanner can diagnose on the spot while a pap smear requires tissue samples be sent to a technician.  It is billed as being able to diagnose sooner and for less cost after recouping the initial investment purchasing the scanner.  

It is not currently able to be sold in the US because it is in an FDA ""investigatory"" period.  Again, I am not an expert but I believe this period will end and it will be approved before 2022. (pure speculation)  But here are the reasons I believe it will be approved and yes they are all speculations 

1.  Indonesia has purchased LuViva orders 9 times with the most recent order in Dec. 2018 at $350,000 of product.  I do not believe they would continue purchasing it if it were causing harm to people, but I am not an expert on FDA approval or Indonesian healthcare morality
2.  GTHP signed a deal Dec. 18th with above mentioned Hungarian manufacturer/ distributor.  These markets will see sales by the end of 2019 and can provide further evidence of its safe use and efficiency.
3.  In July 2017 the CEO was on a podcast and apparently said once they finished securing funding they would begin what he hopes is the final study needed to appease any FDA concerns and get approval.  He believed it would be ~18 months from the beginning of that study when everything wraps up and it could be approved.  The actual numbers are 9 months for the study + 180 days of FDA review and I believe he left the extra 3 months for securing funding.  It has been 17 months since then and I cannot find news about the study going on but I do not know if there would be news about that anyway.  However with the new deal in Hungary I would speculate that they will be able to afford the study within 5 years.  

In short they have a great product and if it can get FDA approved in the next few years it could take over the cervical cancer diagnosis market.  Use in foreign markets should help accelerate this through extra funds for the company and foreign studies.  If it goes wrong LuViva is GTHPs only product, that is a huge concern but I do not see how shining light through tissue would hurt it; Im also not a doctor.  ",2018-12-21

98,AudioLibertas,ecc8n4g,/r/pennystocks/comments/a8bl8s/new_canadian_mining_company_just_released_their/ecc8n4g/,1,"By using the term reinstated, are you saying that it was already around and then brought back for investment. That is contradictory to your statement that everything is brand new. The company has been around since late 2009 so I'm a little confused by what you mean. I am also looking for good investments, but this appears way to fishy as it has flat lined for the past three years and there have been no press releases from the company or records. I don't buy the idea this is a new company with all new stuff because it isn't. Stop trying to scam people out of there money. ",2018-12-21

It is up 40 percent because it takes barely any money to buy up shares and drive the price up. You probably made the price go up 40 percent just by posting this. ,2018-12-21

The people who have responded to this post have easily bought several million shares out of the total available, which could easily influence market price depending on their bid price.

I highly suggest after your up a good bit on it, you set a stop loss at a comfortable profit exit. The problem with owning that many shares comes in when it’s tanking back down 80%, and it happens out of nowhere, try selling all those shares at once. 1 minute your up 125%, by the time you realize there’s a sell off and dump your shares, you made 20% or even worse....negative.
