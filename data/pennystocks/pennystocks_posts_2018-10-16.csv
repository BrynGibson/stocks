Hey guys here a DD package I’m working on: 


I took a starter in RCGP on the pull back. 284K float cannabis play. Here are some things I found. The new officers of the company and their backgrounds and how much money they’ve made are what really grabbed my attention on this

https://twitter.com/silverlakes123/status/1047612753161195520?s=21 

On top of all of this, I emailed the CEO Ray Grimm of https://newyounow.com and it is confirmed through him that they are taking ownership of RCGP and there will be filings of ownership change on October 15th...this might turn into a huge merger play guys 

Look at Ray Grimm’s success: http://www.raygrimmjr.com 

The email I received: https://ibb.co/mM0f4K 



UPDATE OCTOBER 6TH:
RCGP Filings came out AH yesterday confirming a merger, Guys I’m doing more digging into the new CEO of $RCGP that CBD naturals is merging into and I’m starting to find some interesting things. Grimm was ceo of Laguna Blends, He orchestrated the RM into isodiol, Found a pr from isodiol that says that CBD naturals is a sister company. Helped them develop their water line. Have to ask Grimm. But after he stepped down as ceo there, it said he was staying on as an advisor.
