&gt; A family of five on holiday from the UK and an experienced pilot have been named as the victims of a seaplane crash at the Hawkesbury River on New Year&amp;#039;s Eve.

&gt; Police have named the victims as Gareth Morgan, a 44-year-old experienced seaplane pilot; Emma Bowden, aged 48 and her daughter Heather Bowden, aged 11; Ms Bowden&amp;#039;s fiance Richard Cousins, 58, and his sons Edward and William Cousins, aged 23 and 25 respectively.

&gt; By 7.30pm, police divers had recovered all six bodies but the DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane remained in 13 metres of water overnight under police guard.

Bull. As much as I think NK is in the wrong, and is a renegade, unjust and cruel country run by a despot- the quote is wrong.

NK has been pretty steadfast in always appending *if* they are attacked to every statement about it's threat statements. The western press however loves quoting only the first part of those statements. Does not help in attempting to defuse, especially with some countries selectively repeating same for domestic consumption.",2018-01-01
